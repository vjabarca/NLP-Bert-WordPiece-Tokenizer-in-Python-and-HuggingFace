Yesterday, I had an article published at Galus Australis, which is a great website that features articles about Jewish life in Australia. I wrote about organ donation, as there are particular issues for Orthodox Jews when considering signing up as a potential donor.
For those less interested in the intricacies of Jewish jurisprudence, I’d like to present the Australian spin to the issue. This is a cheat of a post, because I’m going to pull some of the Galus Australis article into it, but I will add some further detail to assuage my guilt.
The good news for Australians is that we have a high rate of successful transplants. The bad news is that rates of organ donation in Australia are embarrassingly low for a developed country. According to the Organ and Tissue Authority’s website, around 1700 Australians are on a transplant list; last year, only half the organs needed were donated. (Fewer donors are needed than there are recipients, as one donor can save up to 10 lives, as well as providing non-essential [but life-changing] tissue, such as corneas to cure blindness.)
Fewer than one in five Australians have discussed their wishes regarding donation with their families. This is why donation rates are so low: people don’t know their loved one’s wishes and err on the side of refusal.
The Authority has a campaign running to encourage people to discuss their wishes regarding donation with their families. In many ways, this is more important than actually registering as a donor, as it’s the family, not the individual, that makes the ultimate decision. The message is pretty clear: register as an organ donor and talk about it with your family.
It can be uncomfortable to make plans about your body after death, and of course it’s highly unlikely that you will become an organ donor. But that’s precisely why it’s so important to have more potential organ donors willing and registered. It can also be helpful to consider registering for bone marrow donation and donating blood regularly; in the context of these living donations, the focus is taken off donation after death.
Health care in Australia is actually pretty good, compared to, say, Ethiopia. Still, there’s plenty of room for improvement. So I was interested in what would happen on 19 April, when COAG (the Council of Australian Governments) met to thrash out Rudd’s proposition to take over health care (currently divided between federal and state governments, the latter of which I personally believe should be abolished altogether).
I didn’t get my act together to comment on the results of the meeting earlier because I was busy with the aftermath of a hospital experience of my own — the birth of my second child. (I’ll get to birth politics in another post.) Since then, the Budget has yielded more health-related reforms to debate at dinner parties, but the agreement in April still holds my interest, and here’s why.
I’m generally a healthy person, so apart from a visit to emergency after spraining an ankle on a weekend, my main experience with the hospital system has been for natal (pre, peri and post) care. This was a fairly straightforward experience with my first child, at least in terms of continuity of care. With my second, however, things got a little complicated.
In retrospect, I didn’t help matters by choosing the “shared care” option of care. This meant that instead of taking the option of seeing the same midwife the whole pregnancy, I had most of my appointments with my general practitioner. This was more convenient for me and I like her, so it worked well until I was about 30 weeks’ pregnant and diagnosed with gestational diabetes. The midwife who broke the news to me slagged off my GP for not calling me to let me know (when actually she’d ordered the test so long before, I’d hardly expect her to be holding her breath for my borderline results).
And it all went downhill from there. I got a referral to an endocrinologist and a diabetes educator. I had to see an obstetrician to clear me to go back to shared care, and was transferred to a different obstetric team for that appointment, so that the appointment could be on the same day as the endocrinologist appointment.
Initially these changes, like the dietary changes and finger prick blood tests, were more of an inconvenience than anything else. But at 38 weeks, with work deadlines competing with my due date, I decided to skip my last endocrinologist appointment. I was meant to make a midwife appointment while I was there, but I figured I could see the GP instead. She was happy to give me a check-up but said that I really should be having my appointments at the hospital at that stage.
But we were both puzzled about who I should be seeing. The obstetricians had cleared me to go back to the GP but I’d been taken off my previous team, so I had no midwife to look after me. She called the shared care liaison officer and got a voicemail message. In desperation I tried to contact the diabetes educator and finally got lucky — another midwife, Fiona, answered the phone and squeezed me into her schedule. I made it to one appointment with her before my son was born.
The point of this story is that health care in this country is too complex, even for someone who’s fairly health literate. Communication between health professionals is poor. Outside of set appointment times, patients’ access to health professionals is pretty much non-existent. Fiona mentioned that the hospital was moving away from group midwifery (where women have one midwife looking after them for pregnancy and birth, which is obviously excellent) and more towards shared care — because the hospital was broke.
If this goes ahead, it will leave more women bewildered about where they fit in the system. When I worked as a medical receptionist, patients would often call to request a home visit when they really needed to have called an ambulance five minutes previously. Patients hold up GPs and even orthopaedic surgeons with their life stories, often (I think) because they genuinely don’t know who they really should turn to.
So when a government meeting promises to “[help] patients receive more seamless care across sectors of the health system”, all I can say is YES PLEASE. Whatever other criticisms can be levelled at Rudd and the current government, if they can actually achieve simplicity in health care, I’ll be impressed.
“Good and ill have not changed since yesteryear,” says Aragorn in Lord of the Rings, but to me the goalposts must have shifted somewhere along the way. In my lifetime, mainstream opinions about euthanasia, and abortion (to name two important examples) have changed drastically.
The article linked above describes the extreme measures that parents of a Ashley, a girl with serious brain damage, have taken to change their daughter’s life. They have had her sterilised, so that she can’t become pregnant if raped; removed her breast buds, so that she won’t have the added discomfort of breasts; and given her growth hormones so that she will remain smaller and thus easier to transfer and care for.
They argue on their blog that they have done this to make her more comfortable and not for their own benefit; certainly they seem to be trying to provide her with the best environment possible. And of course, within reason, making things easier for oneself as a parent does make things better for the child.
In the Time article, the doctors looking after Ashley discuss their approach to this unusual case as doctors. Here’s a quote that I think goes to the heart of the matter:
“I felt we were doing the right thing for this little girl—but that didn’t keep me from feeling a bit of unease,” admits Diekema. “And that’s as it should be. Humility is important in a case like this.”
There’s no rule book for situations like this. And sometimes there just isn’t a right answer. All you can do is weigh it up and make what seems to be the best decision. I don’t know if Ashley’s doctors did the right thing or not. Even they don’t really know. In a sense, that’s what medical ethics is about.
I’ve always been fascinated by this disorder. The MMR vaccine scandal has been interesting to follow as an example of below-par science, and poor understanding by the public of the science. To me, this is just a symptom that science education and mainstream media science reporting needs some vast improvement.
But the main reason is probably that I know so many people on the spectrum. I grew up knowing a family in which all the boys had quite severe autism and have since met others with autism or Asperger syndrome. I always wondered: What sort of place could these boys have in a world where communication is vital? When you “have a different sort of internal thought” that in some cases leaves you completely dependent on your family or other carers for your entire life — what does it mean? What does it tell us about the human brain? Is it really a disorder, or just another state of being?
With autism diagnoses rising steadily, talk of an “epidemic” and a growing search for a cure, Roy feels threatened. “I feel stabbed when it comes to ‘curing’ or ‘treating’ autism,” he says. “It’s like society doesn’t need us.”
Many autistic people are starting to agree. They have had enough of being treated as a medical problem, arguing that autism is not a disease that needs to be cured but just a normal part of human diversity. This emerging “autistic rights” movement hopes to launch an international campaign akin to Gay Pride, encouraging autistic people everywhere to embrace their “neurodiversity”, and persuading wider society to accept them as they are…
Carina Schmidt’s son has autistic disorder and requires round-the-clock attention. His condition is so severe that he required a 10-month stay at the Kennedy Krieger Institute to break some of his self-harming habits. She is adamant about doing everything possible to help her son, who now lives in a group home in Rockville, Maryland. She also supports the development of prenatal tests for autism. “If my son could be cured today I would say ‘yes’,” she says. “My family has suffered like there is no tomorrow – that’s why we choose to have no more kids.” … Schmidt says that she will continue seeking help for her son. And she is sure he wants her to. “I can see my son wants to be normal,” she says.
There are no easy answers here. But I think the research being done now is fascinating and exciting. Even if people with autism don’t want a cure, this research goes to the heart of what makes us human: our complex, intricate, amazing brains.

I began with, “I’m still a therapist in private practice and I also do something called, neurofeedback.”
I answered them both. “Yes, neurofeedback is a type of biofeedback. It’s a way to train one’s brain to better deal with life’s stressors. You sit in a comfortable chair in my office with five non-invasive sensors, which are reading the electricity on the surface of your scalp. There is nothing going into your head. You simply sit back and listen to beautiful and relaxing music for 33 minutes. There’s nothing else you have to do. It’s a non-medical way to overcome some of life’s challenges such as insomnia, depression, anxiety, addictions, ADD/ADHD, etc. It’s also great for people who have experience with regular talk therapy and want a change. It’s complementary with talk therapy and it’s often the missing piece for those who have done a lot of therapy and other forms of working on themselves.”
Being that we were on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, I assumed that many people in the room had at some point worked with a talk therapist. My friends were both very interested in learning more about how neurofeedback works and how it would specifically work for them. One mentioned having repetitive thoughts while the other discussed bouts of insomnia. They asked if neurofeedback could help with both of these issues. I told them that it could and that I currently work with clients who are being treated for those exact issues. The clients were responding very well and in a much shorter period than they expected.
What happens is this: The system I use is called, NeurOptimal®. When your brain shows turbulence, the music makes a minute pause. What happens is that the turbulence the system is flagging for the brain is what happens whenever our brain shifts from one state to another. The pause in the music is a wakeup call to the brain to come back to the present and choose whether or not the shift is a good idea. The system flags ANY state shift, not just problematic ones. Our brains prefer to use energy efficiently. Even when the pause in the music is indecipherable, the brain notices it. The decrease in the regular stress creates calmness and increases the ability to return to the present moment.
Eventually there become fewer and fewer episodes of recycling the past and you are allowed to see and respond to what is actually happening in your life rather than react to it out of habit. Also, as the brain gets calmer, the part of the brain that controls relaxation responses becomes more dominant than the part of the brain the guides the “fight or flight response.” Your body then is able to repair itself and become healthier.”
It was exciting for me to share what I know and exciting for my friends to learn about neuro-what? I mean neurofeedback.

The daunting challenges of making ends meet can have serious implications for members of the working class, particularly in terms of dignity. The ability to provide is tied inextricably to personal dignity; threats to the ability to make ends meet are threats to dignity. For example, Riggs explains that, by and large, society imposes a mandate upon men that they fulfill the role of "breadwinner" by providing for their families financially. Due to societal pressures, the inability to fulfill breadwinner duties can have serious impacts on masculine identity for men (Buzzanell and Turner). Ongoing threats can damage self-esteem. In an examination of what constitutes a living wage, Glickman quotes a McDonald's worker who wanted a raise in the federal minimum wage to ten dollars per hour. He explained, "A man can't have any self-respect for less than that" (xii). It is important to note that men are not alone. Women, too, take the role of providing seriously, particularly when they have sole responsibility for those duties. In the United States, 12.9 million households are run by single mothers (Simmons and O'Neill). Within African American communities, women often assume a central role of providing and protecting. Fine and Wies explain that a "roof over our heads and food in our stomachs" (162) is frequently a mantra of African American women, regardless of their marital status.
The material conditions of the working class that lead to difficulty in making ends meet (low wages, limited benefits, job instability) certainly are cause for concern. However, disregarding, discounting, or denying the struggle itself—whether in scholarship, policy debates, or daily discourse—is just as damaging. Zweig explains: "When society fails to acknowledge the existence and experience of working people it robs them of an articulate sense of themselves and their place in society. We know from the vibrancy of other identity movements that to silence and leave nameless a central aspect of a person's identity is to strip them of a measure of power over their lives. A full, realistic self-identity is a basic requirement for human dignity" (61).
In this chapter, I give voice to and name a central aspect of membership in the working class in an effort to bolster a sense of dignity among its members. I argue that providing and protecting, particularly problematized providing and protecting, is a fundamental principle of working-class identity and organizing. As such, it surfaces in everyday rhetoric.
Pretty straightforward: With the help of your partner, put together a puzzle while you enjoy something bubbly.
Its just about the second birthday of this blog. I've really enjoyed two beautiful years of cooking and writing.....and I love the places that this little project has taken me. When I first started writing about food (and of course love) I did it in a conscious effort to learn how to enjoy cooking for one. I had become so used to cooking for dates and boyfriends that I had completely forgotten how to cook a meal just for myself. Tonight I put on a record, poured a glass of wine and sat down to a big bowl of smoked salmon and mushroom ragu. It was delicious, but the best thing about it was how content it made me feel.
There are so many moments in my life at the moment where I am just so filled with joy by all the tiny bits and pieces that make up who I am and how I live my life. It makes me so incredibly happy to have this tiny little life, in this tiny little house, and a big scary job. One day hopefully I'll get around to writing a book about the adventures of a small pastry chef who spends all her time baking cakes and falling in love with the wrong people.......but until then I'll share with you a lovely recipe.
This recipe is from a wonderful new cook book I bought recently and have been so inspired by it. All the recipes are just so very beautiful and interesting. I'm really excited to make the maple bacon cupcakes!
I made these cookies the other night when I was feeling a little blue. Ok lets be honest......I was feeling a little hung over, and I just needed something to help me feel a little grounded. Making cookies always brings me back to earth. So I made these and they made me quite happy.
Roll the cookie dough into desert spoon size bowls and press slightly onto a tray lined with baking paper (leave room for spreading.)

Jane Hatton, who manages Evenbreak, a not-for-profit jobs board run by disabled people for disabled people, publishes her bi-monthly article on the subject of disability and employment. This month, talking letting your personality shine.
Here at Evenbreak I have recently been through the recruitment process myself and taken on two new employees. I know what employers are often looking out for, and it’s not just an impressive skill set.
It is always difficult when recruiting. I wanted to employ all of the candidates, and hated rejecting people, especially when many were really good. But I couldn’t employ everyone, so I had to pick the candidates that stood out. It reminded me of one of my personal recruitment principles – recruit for attitude and train for skills.
Most recruiters do this too, even if they are not aware they are doing it. It is easy to train people and equip them with new skills, but it’s almost impossible to change attitudes. For example, let’s say I wanted to appoint someone to use a particular piece of equipment. Candidate A has been using similar equipment for a number of years. Candidate B has never used this equipment before, and would need to be trained to use it. The obvious successful candidate is candidate A.
But let’s say I have a bit more information about these two candidates. It turns out that candidate A is a bit lazy, and makes many mistakes. They often turn up late without any explanation, and rarely complete their work when they say they will.
Candidate B, on the other hand, is punctual, conscientious, learns quickly and is always reliable and keen to do the best work they possibly can. Now which seems the more attractive candidate? I would be more tempted by candidate B – I can easily teach them how to use the equipment and they will be a conscientious and loyal employee. I might not have to train candidate A, but I would be concerned that they would cause problems.
When we are looking for work, of course we have to think about our skills, qualifications and experience. But it is important also to think about any personality traits that might be attractive to an employer. These can be mentioned on your CV, and should certainly brought out at interview.
In my recent round of recruitment, the best candidate on paper (i.e. the one with the most impressive CV) turned out to be the least attractive candidate at interview. They sounded very negative, and asked lots of questions that started with; “I wouldn’t want to …….” – it sounded like they really didn’t want the job at all!
Another candidate, who had very little experience in the field I was looking for ,showed lots of initiative and enthusiasm, and had really done lots of homework and research on my company. Much more impressive.
The two people I did take on had all the skills I was looking for, and had shown lots of enthusiasm for the role and the company. They seemed keen to learn and flexible – very attractive traits indeed.
What personality traits do you have that might be attractive to an employer? Take a look at the following and see which applies to you:
All these things can be just as valuable as qualifications and experience, if not more so. So make sure your prospective employer knows about them. Use your personality shine.

Some 4,000 years ago, a number of mighty Bronze Age cultures crumbled. Were they done in by political strife and societal unrest? Or by a change in the climate?
Mesopotamia: cradle of civilization, the fertile breadbasket of western Asia, a little slice of paradise between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Today the swath of land north of the Persian Gulf is still prime real estate. But several millennia ago Mesopotamia was absolutely The Place to Be. There the visionary king Hammurabi ruled, and Babylon’s hanging gardens hung. There the written word, metalworking, and bureaucracy were born. From the stately, rational organization of Mesopotamia’s urban centers, humanity began its inexorable march toward strip malls and shrink-wrap and video poker bars and standing in line at the dmv. What’s more, the emergence of the city-state meant that we no longer had to bow to the whims of nature. We rose above our abject dependence on weather, tide, and tilth; we were safe in the arms of empire. Isn’t that what being civilized is all about?
Not if you ask Harvey Weiss. Weiss, professor of Near Eastern archeology at Yale, has challenged one of the cherished notions of his profession: that early civilizations—with their monuments and their grain reserves, their texts and their taxes—were somehow immune to natural disaster. He says he’s found evidence of such disaster on a scale so grand it spelled calamity for half a dozen Bronze Age cultures from the Mediterranean to the Indus Valley—including the vaunted vale of Mesopotamia. Historians have long favored political and social explanations for these collapses: disruptions in trade routes, incompetent administrators, barbarian invasions. Prehistoric societies, simple agriculturists—they can be blown out by natural forces, says Weiss. But the early civilizations of the Old World? It’s not supposed to happen.
Yet happen it did, says Weiss, and unlike his predecessors, he’s got some data to back him up. The evidence comes from a merger of his own archeological expertise with the field of paleoclimatology, the study of climates past. His first case study concerns a series of events that occurred more than 4,000 years ago in a region of northern Mesopotamia called the Habur Plains. There, in the northeast corner of what is present-day Syria, a network of urban centers arose in the middle of the third millennium b.c. Sustained by highly productive organized agriculture, the cities thrived. Then, around 2200 b.c., the region’s new urbanites abruptly left their homes and fled south, abandoning the cities for centuries to come.
Weiss believes that the inhabitants fled an onslaught of wind and dust kicked up by a drought that lasted 300 years. He also believes the drought crippled the empire downriver, which had come to count on the agricultural proceeds of the northern plains. Moreover, he contends, the long dry spell wasn’t just a local event; it was caused by a rapid, region-wide climate change whose effects were felt by budding civilizations as far west as the Aegean Sea and the Nile and as far east as the Indus Valley. While the Mesopotamians were struggling with their own drought-induced problems, he points out, neighboring societies were collapsing as well: the Old Kingdom in Egypt, early Bronze Age cities in Palestine, and the early Minoan civilization of Crete. And in the Indus Valley, refugees fleeing drought may have overwhelmed the cities of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa. The troubles of half a dozen Bronze Age societies, says Weiss, can be blamed on a single event—and a natural disaster at that.
Weiss first presented this scenario in 1993, when soil analyses showed that a period of severe dust storms accompanied the mysterious Habur hiatus. I was thinking you can’t have a microregion drought, he recalls, because that isn’t how climate works. It’s got to be much bigger. And I said, ‘Wait a minute, didn’t I read about this in graduate school? Weren’t there those who, 30 years ago, had said that drought conditions were probably the agency that accounts for all these collapses that happened in contiguous regions?’ says Weiss. Back in the late sixties, we had read this stuff and laughed our heads off about it.
In 1966, British archeologist James Mellaart had indeed blamed drought for the downfalls of a whole spectrum of third-millennium civilizations, from the early Bronze Age communities in Palestine to the pyramid builders of Egypt’s Old Kingdom. But when Mellaart first put forth this idea, he didn’t have much in the way of data to back him up. Weiss, however, can point to new paleoclimate studies for his proof. These studies suggest that an abrupt, widespread change in the climate of western Asia did in fact occur at 2200 b.c. Samples of old ocean sediments from the Gulf of Oman, for example, show signs of extreme drought just when Weiss’s alleged exodus took place. A new model of air-mass movement explains how subtle shifts in atmospheric circulation could have scorched Mesopotamia as well as points east, west, and south. And recent analyses of ice cores from Greenland—which offer the most detailed record of global climate change—reveal unusual climatic conditions at 2200 b.c. that could well have brought drought to the region in question.
I’ve got some figures i can show you. figures always help, says paleoclimatologist Peter deMenocal, swiveling his chair from reporter to computer in his office at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, just north of New York City. On the monitor, deMenocal pulls up a graph derived from the research project known as gisp2 (for Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2). gisp2 scientists, he explains, use chemical signals in ice cores to reconstruct past climates. There are two kinds of naturally occuring oxygen atoms, heavy and light, and they accumulate in ice sheets in predictable ratios that vary with prevailing temperatures. In a cool climate, for example, heavy oxygen isotopes are less easily evaporated out of the ocean and transported as snow or rain to northern landmasses like Greenland. In a warm climate, however, more heavy oxygen isotopes will be evaporated, and more deposited in the Greenland ice sheets.
By tracking oxygen-isotope ratios within the ice cores, the gisp2 graph reflects temperatures over Greenland for the past 15,000 years. Near the bottom of the graph, a black line squiggle wildly until 11,700 years ago, when the last ice age ended and the current warm era, the Holocene, began. The line then climbs steadily for a few thousand years, wavering only modestly, until 7,000 years before the present. From then until now, global temperatures appear relatively stable—then until now comprising, of course, the entire span of human civilization.
The archeological community—and actually segments of the paleoclimate community—have viewed the Holocene as being climatically stable, says deMenocal. And so they imagine that the whole drama of civilization’s emergence took place on a level playing field in terms of the environment.
Until he met Harvey Weiss, deMenocal wasn’t much interested in studying the Holocene; like most of his peers, he was more drawn to the dynamic climate fluctuations that preceded it. In fact, the Holocene had something of a bad rep among climatologists. It was thought of as kind of a boring time to study, says deMenocal. Like, why would you possibly want to? All the action is happening 20,000 years earlier.
Then a few years ago he read an account of Weiss’s drought theory and had an epiphany of sorts. It occurred to him that even the smallest variations in climate could be interesting if they had influenced the course of history. What if something was going on in the Holocene after all? He looked up the 1993 paper in which Weiss had laid out the evidence for the Habur hiatus and reported the results of the soil analysis.
I was pretty skeptical, says deMenocal. I mean, what would you expect if everyone left a town? It would get dusty. Especially in the world’s dustiest place. Big surprise.
Weiss, meanwhile, was getting a similar response from many of his peers. But when he and deMenocal met at a conference in 1994, they hit it off right away—largely because Weiss, too, was dismayed at the paucity of his own evidence. Peter was immediately sensitive to my moaning about how we needed additional data, different kinds of data, says Weiss. And he immediately understood where such data could be obtained.
DeMenocal told Weiss that if a large-scale drought had in fact occurred, it would have left a mark in the sediments of nearby ocean floors—the floor of the Gulf of Oman, for example. Lying approximately 700 miles southeast of ancient Mesopotamia, the gulf would have caught any windblown dust that swept down from the Tigris and Euphrates valleys. (The Persian Gulf is closer, but because it’s so shallow, its sediments get churned up, thereby confusing their chronology.) And deMenocal just happened to know some German scientists who had a sediment core from the Gulf of Oman.
Analysis of the gulf core is ongoing, but deMenocal has already extracted enough information to confirm Weiss’s suspicions. To track dry spells in the sediments, he and his colleague Heidi Cullen looked for dolomite, a mineral found in the mountains of Iraq and Turkey and on the Mesopotamian floodplains that could have been transported to the gulf only by wind. Most of the Holocene section of the core consists of calcium carbonate sediments typical of ocean bottoms.
And then all of a sudden, at exactly 4,200 calendar years, there’s this big spike of dolomite, says deMenocal—a fivefold increase that slowly decays over about three centuries. The chemistry of the dolomite dust matches that of the dolomite in the Mesopotamian mountains and plains, verifying the mineral’s source. And not only did deMenocal and his colleagues figure out what happened, they may have figured out how. Studies by Gerard Bond at Lamont-Doherty have shown that the timing of the drought coincided with a cooling period in the North Atlantic. According to a survey by Cullen of current meteorological records, such cooling would have dried out the Middle East and western Asia by creating a pressure gradient that drew moisture to the north and away from the Mediterranean.
The whole disruption, collapse bit, well, I just have to take Harvey at his word, says deMenocal. What I tried to do is bring some good hard climate data to the problem. Why hasn’t anybody seen this signature of calamity before? Simple, says deMenocal. No one looked for it.
Weiss’s first hints of climate-associated calamity came from a survey of his principal excavation site, a buried city in northeastern Syria called Tell Leilan. Tell Leilan (rhymes with Ceylon) was one of three major cities on the Habur Plains to be taken over by the Akkadian Empire around 2300 b.c. The city covered more than 200 acres topped by a haughty acropolis, and was sustained by a tightly regulated system of rain-fed agriculture that was co-opted and intensified by the imperialists from the south. Weiss had asked Marie-Agnès Courty of the National Center for Scientific Research in France to examine the ancient soils of Tell Leilan to help him understand the agricultural development of the region. She reported that a section dating from 2200 to 1900 b.c. showed evidence of severe drought, including an eight-inch-thick layer of windblown sand and a marked absence of earthworm tunnels.
In his own excavations of the same period, Weiss had already found evidence of desertion: mud-brick walls that had fallen over clay floors and were covered with, essentially, 300 years’ worth of compacted dust. And once he made the drought connection at Tell Leilan, he began turning up clues to the catastrophe everywhere he looked. In 1994, for example, Gerry Lemcke, a researcher at the Swiss Technical University in Zurich, presented new analyses of sediment cores taken from the bottom of Lake Van in Turkey, which lies at the headwaters of the Tigris and the Euphrates. The new results indicated that the volume of water in the lake—which corresponds to the amount of rainfall throughout western Asia—declined abruptly 4,200 years ago. At the same time, the amount of windblown dust in the lake increased fivefold.
Weiss came to believe that the effects of the drought reached downriver to the heart of Mesopotamia, causing the collapse of the Akkadian Empire. The collapse itself is undisputed: written records describe how, soon after it had consolidated power, Akkad crumbled, giving way to the Ur III dynasty in—when else?—2200 b.c. The cause of this collapse has been the subject of considerable speculation. But Weiss’s studies of early civilizations have convinced him that their economies—complex and progressive though they may have been—were still fundamentally dependent on agricultural production. In fact, he notes, one hallmark of any civilization is that it requires a life-support system of farming communities toiling away in the fields and turning over the fruits of their labor to a central authority. The drought on the Habur Plains could have weakened the Akkadian Empire by drastically reducing agricultural revenues from that region. People fleeing the drought moved south, where irrigation-fed agriculture was still sustainable. For want of a raindrop, the kingdom was lost.
Well, believe it or not, all my colleagues had not figured that out, says Weiss. They actually believed that somehow this empire was based on bureaucracy, or holding on to trade routes, or getting access to exotic mineral resources in Turkey. But the drought itself is documented, Weiss says, in passages of cuneiform texts. Images from a lengthy composition called the Curse of Akkad, for example, include large fields that produced no grain and heavy clouds that did not rain. Scholars had decided that these expressions were mere metaphor.
And many still stand by their interpretations. I don’t agree with his literal reading of the Mesopotamian texts, and I think he has exaggerated the extent of abandonment in this time period, says Richard Zettler, curator of the Near East section at the University of Pennsylvania’s Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Philadelphia. Zettler doesn’t question the evidence for drought, but he thinks Weiss has overplayed its implications. Although Tell Leilan may well have been deserted during the putative hiatus, for example, nearby cities on the Habur Plains show signs of continuing occupation, he says. As for the Curse and other Mesopotamian passages describing that period, says Zettler, there are a lot of questions on how to read these texts—how much of it is just literary license, whatever. Even if there is a core of historical truth, it’s hard to determine what the core of truth is.
Instead of backing down in the face of such commentary, Weiss has continued to document his thesis. Echoing Mellaart, he points out that 2200 b.c. saw the nearly simultaneous collapses of half a dozen other city-based civilizations—in Egypt, in Palestine, on Crete and the Greek mainland, and in the Indus Valley. The collapses were caused by the same drought, says Weiss, for the same reasons. But because historians and archeologists look for internal rather than external forces to explain civilizations in crisis, they don’t communicate among themselves, he says, and many aren’t even aware of what’s going on next door, as it were.
Very few people understand that there was a synchronous collapse and probably drought conditions in both Egypt and Mesopotamia, let alone the rest of the Old World, says Weiss.
It didn’t help Weiss’s extravagant claims for third-millennium cataclysm that his alleged drought didn’t appear in the gisp2 oxygen-isotope record. The graph in deMenocal’s office, for example, has no spikes or dips or swerves at 2200 b.c., just a nice flat plateau. That graph was drawn from an interpretation of the ice-core data. But according to Paul Mayewski of the University of New Hampshire in Durham, who is chief scientist of gisp2, there are plenty of reasons a drought in western Asia might not make it into the oxygen-isotope record in the Greenland glacier. Greenland might be too far away to feel the regional event, or the drought may have left a different kind of chemical signature. Only a climatologist like Mayewski could explain these reasons, however. And no one asked him to.
As a consequence, a lot of people called Harvey Weiss and said, ‘Well, the gisp2 record is the most highly resolved record of Holocene climate in the world. And if it’s not in there, you’re wrong, Harvey,’ says Mayewski. I didn’t realize that poor Harvey was being abused for not existing in our record.
Fortunately Mayewski, like deMenocal, is a curious sort with interests a bit broader than his own specialty. When he happened upon Weiss’s 1993 paper, he’d already lent a hand on a few archeological projects, including one on the disappearance of Norse colonies from Greenland in the mid-1300s. But he figured other scientists had already looked for the Mesopotamian drought in the climate record. When he finally met Weiss in 1996, he learned otherwise. Mayewski began reanalyzing his core data with Weiss’s theory in mind, and he uncovered a whole new Holocene.
We can definitely show from our records that the 2200 b.c. event is unique, says Mayewski. And what’s much more exciting than that, we can show that most of the major turning points in civilization in western Asia also correlate with what we would say would be dry events. We think that we have found a proxy for aridity in western Asia.
Earlier interpretations of the gisp2 data had measured a variety of ions in ice cores that would reveal general information about climate variability. To look for the 2200 b.c. drought in particular, Mayewski used tests based on 2.5-year intervals in the climate record instead of 50- to 100-year intervals. He also collected a broader set of data that allowed him to reconstruct specific patterns of atmospheric circulation—not only over land but over land and oceans. When Mayewski focused on the movement of air masses over oceans, he found that air transport from south to north in the Atlantic—so-called meridional circulation—hit a significant winter low some 4,200 years ago. Mayewski and deMenocal are studying how this event relates to drought in western Asia.
But it seems on the basis of the paleoclimatic data that there is no doubt about the event at 2200 b.c., says Weiss. What the qualities of this event were, and what the magnitude of this event was, that is the current research frontier now.
Trouble is, even though the drought may seem like a sure thing, its effects on Mesopotamia are still unproved, as Zettler points out. They will remain controversial, Weiss admits, until archeologists better understand the contributions of politics, agriculture, and climate in the formation of ancient societies. That mission grows more urgent as more archeologists seem ready to grapple with models of climatic determinism. In the past few years, drought and flooding have been cited in the demise of several New World civilizations, including the Maya of Central America, the Anasazi of the American Southwest, and the Moche and Tiwanaku of Peru and Bolivia.
Until climatic conditions are quantified, it’s going to be very difficult to understand what the effects of climate changes—particularly controversial, abrupt ones—were upon these societies, says Weiss. The precise constellation of forces that led to the collapse of Bronze Age cultures around 2200 b.c. will probably be debated for a very long time. But paleoclimatology has assured Mother Nature a place in that constellation. And the notion that civilizations are immune to natural disaster may soon be ancient history.
A few weeks ago while visiting a forest at the coast I took a stroll in the evening. One of the most common kinds of ants along the East African coast are members of the genus Polyrachis. These are fairly large (as ants go!), over 1 cm long, and can commonly be found clambering around houses and trees.
This particular ant was wandering up a twig of a tangled shrub at the edge of the path. It walked up and down the stem several times before climbing onto a leaf. These ants are famous for tending other insects – primarily bugs of various kinds that suck plant juices and reward the ants with treats of honeydew. I found this bug lying against the stem where the ant was walking up and down.
After a few minutes, the ant clambered on to a leaf in the sunshine. There it sat sunning itself for a few minutes before wandering off.
I wonder what it was thinking of – perhaps ‘How do I get home to my colony?’, Or was it, just like I was, enjoying the evening sunshine streaming through the forest… It seems that even ants need a moment to themselves sometimes.

People born in the Year of the Ox are patient, speak little, and inspire confidence in others. They tend, however, to be eccentric, and bigoted, and they anger easily. They have fierce tempers and although they speak little, when they do they are quite eloquent. Ox people are mentally and physically alert. Generally easy-going, they can be remarkably stubborn, and they hate to fail or be opposed. They are most compatible with Snake, Rooster, and Rat people.

Here she is resting in comfort LOL. Sorry couldn't help myself-these are the moments that makes it all worth being a mom.
Still haven't been able to get a good look at the 6 new Frnech angoras that arrived two weekends ago. Mommy still gets snarly when i reach in and the babies are staying covered in fluff. So far there is two brokens (see noses poking out) and four solids.
The satins agoras are easy -6 all whites -but oh the sheen to them. Lovely -am hoping to show some of them at the Nationals on May 9th in Canindaugua NY. Will see.
In the meantime spinnning up a storm -working my way through leftover bits to make loads of novelty yarn. As soon as the camera charges up I'll get osme pictures :)
So today is using up odds and ends day. I knit up the last of the Maggies fibre into a little purse for my niece Bri -her favorite colour is purple but Aunt Kim had to throw in a little green angora for hightlights :)
The its off to spin up the leftover dye mohhair -when Jared was done dyeing for the day he poured all the leftover dye onto the bag of mohair I had sitting around -iot it amazing or what :)
I went to get the camera and came back to Bri pretending to spin on the wheel while watching Finding Nemo -she was singing "just keep spinning, spinning, spinning".
Life is good -sun shining, angora rabbits are growing fantastic coats (might be the -25 degree Celcius weather) and spinning wheel is humming along. And best of all a pot of leftover soup is bubbling on the stove. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
So as I was flipping thorugh Yahoo news today I came across another wackpot Animal rights theory. This is from the Amimal Lovers of America a group that has broken off from PETA as they feel PETA isn't active enough. Their newest one is we are cruel to our pets because we do not let them decide when and where they will breed. I mean people have free choice so shouldn't animals is their theory. This from the same people who are euthanizing animals and saying we should not have any as "pets", that they should all be allowed to revert back to their wild status???? WTH??
I orginally thought this was from PETA but when I went back to check the article they had posted a correction.
I can just imagine this in my barn NOT!!! My girls get to see a male no more than twice a year (preferably once), they are allowed to raise their litter safely and securely away from other distractions and threats, THEY decide which ones of the litter stay or go (nature must take its course) and are put down humanely should they have a genetic or other problem that will not allow then to live a helathy natural life.
They are working animals they are not people, the only animals that are accorded "human staus" in this household are Java -(though I really worry about her sometimes she's such a wimp) and of course the two cats who I'm sure are plotting to overthrow me and rule the household -oh wait they already do...... I mean how hard of a life is it sleep all day on the couch, curl up in the bed at night with two people who are careful to leave them space, fed on demand and toys as needed.
I love my animals but they are animals they are not people, I love them, care for them and protect them but do not allow them to run free, breed whenever they feel like it and do not give them a vote? Does this still make me a bad person??
It is done :) And I love both of them. I took one bag of Maggie's Mother Fiber -Nuno Fiber grab bags and split the colours down into two piles. I then spun each pile leaving the colours seperate and made two very different style of hats.
Jared go the Wii and Daddy got Guitar Hero for Christmas so they have been busy playing the guitar. Jared is way better at it -here he is hard at practice. I mean the kid already has groupies LOL. Check out his adoring fans on the couch.
Latest yarn done. One ply grey cotton, one ply ecospun (recycled pop bottles) -cannot say I am very fond of the ecospun -very funny feeling -sure can tell its plastic. Need to get back to my one bag of fibre -two hats project. Took one bag of Maggies amazing needle felting fibre grab bags and split the colours down to two piles. Am spinning and knitting two hats from it. One is done -one to go. Will post pics when they are both done.
BIG box arrived late last night - over 500 pairs of knitting needles and bamboo crochet hooks too. Was very excited to see that they have introduced a new length of circulars 40 inches -whioch have been requested for those who like to knit two socks on one needle -wayyyy beyond my capabilites.
Kids were happy to sort and price for me though followed by a reward trip to Chapters for new books. And McDonalds of course -I don't think there are too many kids who don't love the golden arches.
Weather here is still very very cold but I'm hoping to get up to Ottawa to skate on the canal -it must be the Dutch in me coming out ;) But I'm still Canadian enough to want my hot chocolate and beaver tail.
Lets kick off the years celebration of Year of Natual Fibre! I aske dmy web and blog listers to start me off on the fibre of the month and the votes so far are in.
We'll start off the Fibre of the Month Sale with Cashmere :) Unfortunately I haven't found a local supplier (YET) so this will come from Louet.
"Cashmere comes from a GOAT??!!!" Time and again breeders have heard this statement expressing such surprise. Yes, the exalted luxury fibre classed as cashmere comes from the modest, unassuming little goat. The fibre is so extraordinary, one expects that it should come from some wild, exotic creature, rarely seen by human eyes.
Most goats, other than Angoras, produce an underdown. If the fibre is long enough and fine enough it can be classed as cashmere. Cashmere goats are goats which have been specifically bred for the cashmere fibre. The amount and quality of the fibre is vastly superior than in goats not specifically bred for cashmere fibre production. Angora goats produce mohair, but will not produce cashmere.
Whew what fun it was to watch the dyewizard in action. Colours were selected, considered and chosen with such care. Her's some of the results 15 lots were dyed yesterday!!! He was very very busy and my house now smells like wet wool LOL.
I had purchased some fleeces from a local shetland producer and send them to be made into roving for the dyewizard Jared and his lovely assistant Lindsay to work with. Her's a picture of the 20lbs of white all bagged up and ready to go. And the first two dyepots in the works. Perfect timing as the kids have a snow day (*freezing rain mixed with snow) today so they are happily planning out the colours :) Good thing as we were running short!
We're still waiting for the brown/grey fleeces to be done -they got dropped off later. Its more money to buy the raw fleeces but so worth it in my opinion -this way everything is locally produced and the person who raised the sheep gets a proper salary for their fleece. The local wool co-op only pays $1 -$1.50 a pound or so I have been told. That is so not fair!
I know there are some fibres and spinning items I have to buy overseas but whenever possible try to BUY LOCAL -support your fibre producers!
Wool can be purchased homegrown as can alpaca., llama, yak, angora, mohair and more so think about it!
They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets. Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength.
The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. In an attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on the carpet.
Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrates what I am capable of. However, they merely made condescending comments about what a "good little hunter" I am. Bastards.
There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event. However, I could hear the noises and smell the food. I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of "allergies." I must learn what this means and how to use it to my advantage.
Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow -- but at the top of the stairs.
I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches. The dog receives special privileges. He is regularly released - and seems to be more than willing to return. He is obviously retarded.
The bird has got to be an informant. I observe him communicating with the guards regularly. I am certain that he reports my every move. My captors have arranged protective custody for him in an elevated cell, so he is safe. For now.........
Last night scared the hell out of me. Daryl had a severe allergic reaction to the IVIG treatment last night and was covered in red rash and hives. Called telehealth and got put on hold so took him down to emerg. Good thing we did -we were going to give him Benadryl but found out from the specialist who came down to see Daryl that could have caused him to go into cardiac arrest!!!! I woke every hour last night and kept touching him to make sure he was still breathing. He was amused by it. He told me he was okay several times but I just had to make sure. Thank you lord for letting me keep him! Iasked him this morning if my hair was grey. He said no but then sassed me by say but you are going to be 40 this year so it'll happen soon enough. BRAT~!!
Well the kids headed back to school today. Grudgingly I might add. Threats of freezing rain last night but good this morning. Thank goodness slipping and slidding out to the barn to feed rabbits is not my idea of a good time. 6 new French angoras arrived safe and sound last night. Qucik nose count and then back to mommy before she panics. I'm not one who seperates mom from babies unless necessary. They need to be with their mommy. I am always amazed how mother rabbits willingly bare their entire body to ensure their little ones have enough warmth. I'm aslo amazed at how they quickly decide who is and isn't good in their litter. Sad reality of rabbit raising is if momma doesn't want them and pulls them from the others there is normally something wrong with them and its best to let them go. So far the Christmas litter of 6 satin angoras are doing great -little guys have some awesome coats growing in!! Have to bring the camera out there and get pictures.
Back to the house and work load. Sorting fibre, writing out knitting patterns, sorting drop spindles for upcoming class in February -its so much fun though. Also need to get the dyepots fired up -Jared's creations are almost sold out again.
It seems the whole world is finding out about Jared and his dyeing talent. Today we had a visitor who had bought fibre from Jared at the sheep dog trials in August and now brought her sister from Holland to stock up on the fibery goodness. Best of all they even came complete with some of their work to show us what they had done with it. Nuno felting -awesome!!! I'd love to try this sometime myself.
Life is to short to have somebody else tell you what to do. Live, dance, sing (even if you're like me and can't carry a tune in a bucket) and above all laugh. We know not how many days we have on this earth so don't waste one. Somehow someway what is mean to happen will happen.
I cannot tell what 2009 will hold for us, it is not for me to see the pages ahead of today. But today I laughed with my children, we danced around the house singing badly and we lived life the way it was meant to be lived. We played out in the snow and threw snowballs for a dog to chase. It doesn't get any better than this.
Tomorrow I'll sit down and make January's budget and pay bills, worry about the world out there and think about things of major importance. Or not who knows :)
Tom Doyle took these photos at the riverfront one recent cold morning. You can see these photos and more of Tom's work at his new website www.tomdoylephotography.com.
Tom recently won two Print of the Year awards, one from Professional Photographers of the State of New York last week for a shot of the boathouse on Constitution Island. The other from Dutchess Regional Professional Photographers for a shot of the Half Moon replica. Both of these photos can be seen on his new website.
I’ve been doing a lot of reading about Marshall McLuhan and Tony Schwartz, which has been very enlightening. It came in handy recently, when some folks I know in the Media Ecology Association got into a tiff with some YouTube celebrities, taking issue with some overly loose use (and abuse) of terms. Thinking it through, I came up with a way of linking McLuhan’s and Schwartz’s ideas on resonant intervals with some foundational concepts of information theory. So I weighed in.
I’ve got a separate blog, Secular Progress, for expressly academic or political material. I’d normally keep the content of this one focused on the technical side of database programming for polls or tax lien analysis. But the slides and video I created seem interesting enough from an Information Science perspective that I decided to cross post.
The Traitwise-made poll can be run simultaneously from multiple locations. A few surveys were completed as a result of very light promotion on Google and Facebook. No evidence of any problems so far.
The poll questions are kind of arbitrary and nonsensical because I’m focused on testing the behavior of this widget inside of a WordPress post. Right away it’s evident that if I want the poll to be properly sized, I have to either squeeze, move, or outright eliminate the sidebar widget.
This interactive graph published by the Pew Research Center, tells a couple of important stories about the political mood in the Untied States. Neither is a big surprise. One is that the parties are more polarized, especially among the politically active. The second is that the country as a whole is not polarized (though not coalescing around an ideological consensus either), and tends to be moving slightly left overall.
I’ve been playing with logos, getting help from here and there. Still tweaking, but pretty soon I’ll be able to move on and print up new cards.
I first became aware of ranked choice mathematics in mid 2000, when the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) used Instant Runoff Voting to elect 5 at-large members to the Board of Directors. It’s hard to think of a better approach to support a massively scalable deliberative decision-making system for the Web.
Finally, in 2007, I decided to try building the system I had been thinking about. A lot of time and effort has gone into this since then, under the aegis of what I call the “Indaba Application Network.” IAN’s ranked choice polling sites have included Indaba.org, ChoiceRanker.com, WeVote.net, AmericanQuorum.com, and Mayor2011.com (the last three were also Facebook apps). These were all PHP sites that shared the same underlying MySQL database.
I’m currently in the process of refactoring the database to support proxy voting and better scalability. I’ve also been pursuing a branding strategy for a hybrid liquid democracy/opinion research platform called Sygnol. It’s going to take some time, but the goal is to redeploy the database in SQL Azure, and to scale the service as an API across a broad spectrum of mobile, game, and website channels.
I’d rather be coding, but I also have to put time into publicizing this in order to attract some helpful force multipliers. So here’s my first video, which focuses primarily on the interactive ballot tool and the very cool analytics that ranked choice data make possible.
Grey has also turned his considerable talents to explaining the virtues of ranked choice voting. He’s created four so far.
Head-to-head interfaces are typical of “Whose hotter?” sites such as candobetter.com. The point is to simplify the task of evaluating a long list of options by asking people to view a randomly selected pair of images from a large set, and then select one. The choice is recorded and another pair of images is displayed immediately. It’s fine for idle entertainment since it’s so easy. Of course, the typical user gets bored and quits long before all the options are exhausted. Why? N(N-1)/2.
The reality of N(N-1)/2 boils down to this: As the number of candidates to be evaluated increases by 1, the possible number of pairwise evaluations grows at an increasingly higher number. The growth is less than half the rate of an exponential increase, but significant nonetheless. The underlying math is simple and straightforward (as Larry Bowen demonstrates), with important implications for user interface design.
One of the most advanced head-to-head crowdsourcing applications currently online is AllOurIdeas.org, a Google-funded project led by Princeton-based Sociologist Matthew Salganik. It’s a serious, text-oriented approach toward what Salganik calls “Bottom-Up Social Data Collection.” It’s been used to help small groups design their web sites and to help US citizens discuss national priorities. But even a site as sophisticated as that can’t escape the fundamental challenge of N(N-1)/2.
With just two choices per page, hot-or-not sites and AllOurIdeas benefit from having lots of room to display big, engaging pictures or crisp easy-to-read text boxes. On a per page basis, that space-saving approach leaves little room for confusion. But problems arise as the list of choices increases, taxing respondent patience and undermining the accuracy of results.
Imagine a comparison of just 6 candidates in a hot-or-not styled contest. According to N(N-1)/2, the various names would be seen a total of 30 times because someone would have to click through 15 pages of pairs before a full ordering of preferences is possible. Even worse, someone could easily enter contradictory rankings, for example choosing A over B, B over C, and C over A (This “rock, paper, scissors” problem is known to mathematicians as intransitivity). This happens for a variety of reasons, starting with failure to remember how prior choices were ranked.
Things gets worse as lists get longer. Contests such as the ongoing GOP Presidential debates, which typically present 8 candidates, would require 28 pages. A 12 candidate reality show such as a season-starting American Idol would require 66. A top 25 list such as college football’s Bowl Championship Series would require 300.
The bottom line is that a hot-or-not interface might be ideal if the only two choices are, say RCV versus hot-or-not, or if one’s main interest in publishing a site is to run up page views. But it’s a very different story when serious multi-candidate evaluations are called for, accurate responses are important, and an efficient user experience is desired.
One of my recent projects with the Indaba Application Network was a ranked-choice straw poll dedicated to San Francisco’s ranked-choice/instant runoff Mayoral race. The poll is closed now, but the site will remain online at https://mayor2011.com until the domain name expires. John Avalos pulled out a slim victory on the straw poll site, but came in second to incumbent Ed Lee in the real world vote.
Post-election press reports indicate that San Franciscans weren’t universally enthusiastic about the ranked-choice voting process. There were complaints when it became apparent that someone can be declared winner without actually receiving a majority of the votes cast. Part of the problem is that San Francisco’s ballot only permitted three choices in a field of sixteen candidates, so the instant run off system exhausted ballots more quickly than is desirable.
The ranked-choice voting process in Portland Maine allowed a rank for every candidate and the ballot counting apparently went quite smoothly.
The people of Minneapolis will be using ranked-choice voting for their Mayoral race in 2012. Mayor2011.com is on deck.

What a great time to be a Tiger! We couldn’t be more exited to get the 2016-17 season started, and it’s great having all of our student-athletes back on campus and matches and games underway. Men’s and women’s soccer and volleyball all had big home victories this weekend, so it was great welcoming their fans back with early successes. And congratulations to Coach Noonan and the men’s soccer team on securing the first Palmetto Series point of the year with a 2-1 victory in Columbia!
While football begins this weekend on the road at Auburn, Clemson students are already reserving their spots for the home opener against Troy. We’ve heard great feedback on some of the adjustments made to the process this year, and we’re looking forward to continuing to have the best student support in the country for our Tigers.
Last week I had an opportunity to visit with some of our local media members and give everyone an update on our department as we head into the new academic year. Below is the opening statement we provided, which hopefully touches on several items of interest to each of our great IPTAY donors.
Thanks everyone for coming today. We’re excited to get the 2016-17 athletic year started. It actually got off to a great start last weekend with women’s soccer winning two matches. This weekend we have volleyball, men’s soccer and women’s soccer all playing, so we’re getting into the fall seasons already. We had a great year in 2015-16 – not just with football and men’s soccer reaching their national championship games – but throughout the department. Three ACC championships – with men’s golf and baseball joining football – a 5th place finish for our men’s programs in the Capital One Cup and our highest ranking in the Learfield Director’s Cup in a decade.
And while doing all that on the field we had tremendous success in the classroom – our APR and GSR continue to be among the best in the country, and several sports set GPA records. IPTAY just announced a record year for the annual fund at $29.1 million and $56.6 million total dollars raised … And Brianna Rollins won a gold medal! So that put a nice cap on the year and we’re very proud of her.
It’s tremendous that we’ve set another record for football season tickets. That’s just another measure of the passion and enthusiasm our fans have for our program and the excitement for the upcoming season. With that overflow of demand, there were some adjustments that needed to be made. We’ve lost 2,000 parking spots utilized last year. So we’ve developed options to the East Beach area, including NewSpring and Seneca Creek Road and really increased the shuttle capacity for that area.
We’re continuing with our facilities push. Littlejohn is really getting close, and men’s and women’s basketball have begun workouts in main arena. Still have work to do in Swann Pavilion, but we’re on-time and on-budget moving toward opening that facility soon. – And as we talk about Littlejohn I have to say that our fans are really excited about the team we’ll have this year. We’re over 4,440 season tickets sold and seat selection is going on this week. – The football operation center continues to progress as you guys can see when you’re out at practice. I know a group of you went through it a couple of weeks ago, it’s going to be a difference maker for our football program. The renovated tennis complex continues to move through the process, as does a redesign of the IPTAY Center. When football moves to its new facility we’ll turn that area of the WestZone into our student-athlete academics and wellness area.
When it’s all said and done, we’ll have completed $176 million in capital projects and done so without spending one dollar of state or university dollars – all through private gifts. And I’m excited to announce that we’ll release the details of another Cornerstone Gift of $2.5 million early next week.
We continue to make great upgrades in what we’re now calling our Student-Athlete Wellness Department headed by Dr. Loreto Jackson. It really incorporates the entire student-athlete development from community service to team culture, nutrition, mental health, career prep – really the focus on preparing young people for life after college – which is what we’re all here to do.
Hopefully you’ve been back to campus often since last year, but if you haven’t we’re excited to welcome you back soon. We’ll publish our weekly “Gameday Guide” prior to the Troy game and hope you’ll take a moment to review some of the improvements and changes made for the 2016 football season.

Niger, officially the Republic of Niger , is a landlocked country in Western Africa , named after the Niger River . It borders Nigeria and Benin to the south, Burkina Faso and Mali to the west, Algeria and Libya to the north and Chad to the east. The capital city is Niamey .
The adjective form of Niger is Nigeri e n , which should not be confused with Nigeri a n / for Nigeria and derives from the French nigérien, -ne. There are different opinions about the adjective form however. Merriam-Webster lists Nigerois (which has, despite its sound, no equivalent form in French) only as the noun form. However, there are instances of Nigerois having been used adjectivally. CNN and other news sources often circumvent using the adjective altogether, using the noun instead, e.g. 'the Niger parliament', 'Niger leader slain' or 'Niger's capital', 'Niger's people'. In French, the citizens of Niger use the adjective 'nigérien'.
During recent centuries, the nomadic Tuareg formed large confederations, pushed southward, and, siding with various Hausa states, clashed with the Fulani Empire of Sokoto , which had gained control of much of the Hausa territory in the late 18th century.
In the 19th century, contact with the West began when the first European explorers—notably Mungo Park (British) and Heinrich Barth (German)—explored the area, searching for the source of the Niger River . Although French efforts at pacification began before 1900, dissident ethnic groups, especially the desert Tuareg , were not subdued until 1922, when Niger became a French colony.
Niger's colonial history and development parallel that of other French West African territories. France administered its West African colonies through a governor general in Dakar , Senegal , and governors in the individual territories, including Niger. In addition to conferring French citizenship on the inhabitants of the territories, the 1946 French constitution provided for decentralization of power and limited participation in political life for local advisory assemblies.
A further revision in the organization of overseas territories occurred with the passage of the Overseas Reform Act ( Loi Cadre ) of July 23 , 1956 , followed by reorganizational measures enacted by the French Parliament early in 1957. In addition to removing voting inequalities, these laws provided for creation of governmental organs, assuring individual territories a large measure of self-government. After the establishment of the Fifth French Republic on December 4 , 1958 , Niger became an autonomous state within the French Community. Following full independence on August 3 , 1960 , however, membership was allowed to lapse.
For its first 14 years as an independent state, Niger was run by a single-party civilian regime under the presidency of Hamani Diori . In 1974, a combination of devastating drought and accusations of rampant corruption resulted in a military coup that overthrew the Diori regime. Col. Seyni Kountché and a small military group ruled the country until Kountché's death in 1987. He was succeeded by his Chief of Staff, Col. Ali Saibou , who released political prisoners , liberalized some of Niger's laws and policies, and promulgated a new constitution . However, President Saibou's efforts to control political reforms failed in the face of union and student demands to institute a multi-party democratic system . The Saibou regime acquiesced to these demands by the end of 1990. New political parties and civic associations sprang up, and a national conference was convened in July 1991 to prepare the way for the adoption of a new constitution and the holding of free and fair elections. The debate was often contentious and accusatory, but under the leadership of Prof. André Salifou, the conference developed consensus on the modalities of a transition government . A transition government was installed in November 1991 to manage the affairs of state until the institutions of the Third Republic were put into place in April 1993. While the economy deteriorated over the course of the transition, certain accomplishments stand out, including the successful conduct of a constitutional referendum ; the adoption of key legislation such as the electoral and rural codes; and the holding of several free, fair, and non-violent nationwide elections. Freedom of the press flourished with the appearance of several new independent newspapers.
Rivalries within a ruling coalition elected in 1993 led to governmental paralysis, which provided Col. Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara a rationale to overthrow the Third Republic in January 1996. While leading a military authority that ran the government ( Conseil de Salut National ) during a 6-month transition period, Baré enlisted specialists to draft a new constitution for a Fourth Republic announced in May 1996. Baré organized a presidential election in July 1996. While voting was still going on, he replaced the electoral commission. The new commission declared him the winner after the polls closed. His party won 90% of parliament seats in a flawed legislative election in November 1996. When his efforts to justify his coup and subsequent questionable elections failed to convince donors to restore multilateral and bilateral economic assistance, a desperate Baré ignored an international embargo against Libya and sought Libyan funds to aid Niger's economy. In repeated violations of basic civil liberties by the regime, opposition leaders were imprisoned; journalists often arrested, and deported by an unofficial militia composed of police and military; and independent media offices were looted and burned.
In the of an initiative started under the 1991 national conference, however, the government signed peace accords in April 1995 with all, meaning Tuareg and Toubou groups that had been in rebellion since 1990. The Tuareg claimed they lacked attention and resources from the central government. The government agreed to absorb some former rebels into the military and, with French assistance, help others return to a productive civilian life.
In 9 April 1999 , Baré was killed in a coup led by Maj. Daouda Malam Wanké , who established a transitional National Reconciliation Council to oversee the drafting of a constitution for a Fifth Republic with a French style semi-presidential system . In votes that international observers found to be generally free and fair, the Nigerien electorate approved the new constitution in July 1999 and held legislative and presidential elections in October and November 1999. Heading a coalition of the National Movement for a Developing Society (MNSD) and the Democratic and Social Convention (CDS), Mamadou Tandja won the presidency.
In July 2004, Niger held municipal elections nationwide as part of its decentralization process. Some 3,700 people were elected to new local governments in 265 newly established communes. The ruling MNSD party won more positions than any other political party; however, opposition parties made significant gains.
In November and December 2004, Niger held presidential and legislative elections . Tandja Mamadou was elected to his second 5-year presidential term with 65% of the vote in an election that international observers called generally free and fair. This was the first presidential election with a democratically elected incumbent and a test to Niger's young democracy.
In the 2004 legislative elections, the National Movement of the Development Society (MNSD), the Democratic and Social Convention (CDS), the Social Democratic Rally (RSD), the Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP), the Nigerien Alliance for Democracy and Progress (ANDP), and the Party for Socialism and Democracy in Niger (PSDN) coalition, which backed Tandja, won 88 of the 113 seats in the National Assembly.
Beginning in 2005, a food crisis struck the country in the wake of drought and locust attacks in the previous year.
Niger's new constitution was approved in July 1999. It restored the semi-presidential system of government of the December 1992 constitution (Third Republic) in which the president of the republic, elected by universal suffrage for a five-year term, and a prime minister named by the president share executive power . As a reflection of Niger's increasing population, the unicameral National Assembly was expanded in 2004 to 113 deputies elected for a 5 year term under a majority system of representation. Political parties must attain at least 5% of the vote in order to gain a seat in the legislature.
The constitution also provides for the popular election of municipal and local officials, and the first-ever successful municipal elections took place 24 July 2004 . The National Assembly passed in June 2002 a series of decentralization bills. As a first step, administrative powers will be distributed among 265 communes (local councils); in later stages, regions and departments will be established as decentralized entities. A new electoral code was adopted to reflect the decentralization context. The country is currently divided into 8 regions, which are subdivided into 36 districts (departments). The chief administrator (Governor) in each department is appointed by the government and functions primarily as the local agent of the central authorities.
The current legislature elected in December 2004 contains seven political parties. President Mamadou Tandja was re-elected in December 2004 and reappointed Hama Amadou as Prime Minister. Mahamane Ousmane , the head of the CDS, was re-elected President of the National Assembly (parliament) by his peers. The new second term government of the Fifth Republic took office on 30 December 2002 . In August 2002, serious unrest within the military occurred in Niamey , Diffa , and Nguigmi , but the government was able to restore order within several days.
Niger is divided into seven departments and one capital district. The departments are subdivided into thirty-six arrondissements and further subdivided into 129 communes . The departments and capital district are:
Niger is a landlocked nation in West Africa located along the border between the Sahara and Sub-Saharan regions. Its geographic coordinates are longitude 16°N and latitude 8°E. Its area is 1,267,000 square kilometres (489,000 sq mi ) of which 300 square kilometres (115 sq mi) is water. This makes Niger slightly less than twice the size of the U.S. state of Texas , and the world's twenty-second largest country (after Chad ). Niger is comparable in size to Angola .
Niger borders seven countries on all sides and has a total of 5,697 kilometres (3,540 mi ) of borders. The longest border is Nigeria to the south (1,497 km; 930 mi). This is followed by Chad to the east, at 1,175 kilometres (730 mi), Algeria to the north-northwest (956 km; 594 mi), and Mali at 821 kilometres (510 mi). Niger also has small borders in its far southwest frontier with Burkina Faso at 628 kilometres (390 mi) and Benin at 266 kilometres (165 mi) and to the north-northeast ( Libya at 354 kilometres (220 mi).
Niger's subtropical climate is mainly very hot and dry, with much desert area. In the extreme south there is a tropical climate on the edges of the Niger River basin. The terrain is predominantly desert plains and sand dunes , with flat to rolling savannah in the south and hills in the north.
The lowest point is the Niger River , with an elevation of 200 metres (722 ft ). The highest point is Monts Bagzane at 2,022 metres (6,634 ft).
Niger is the poorest country in the world, ranking last on the United Nations Development Programme 's Human Development Index . It is a landlocked, sub-Saharan nation, whose economy centers on subsistence crops, livestock, and some of the world's largest uranium deposits. Drought cycles, desertification, a 2.9% population growth rate, and the drop in world demand for uranium have undercut the economy.
Niger shares a common currency, the CFA franc , and a common central bank, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), with seven other members of the West African Monetary Union .
In December 2000, Niger qualified for enhanced debt relief under the International Monetary Fund program for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and concluded an agreement with the Fund for Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). Debt relief provided under the enhanced HIPC initiative significantly reduces Niger's annual debt service obligations, freeing funds for expenditures on basic health care, primary education, HIV/AIDS prevention, rural infrastructure, and other programs geared at poverty reduction. In December 2005, it was announced that Niger had received 100% multilateral debt relief from the IMF, which translates into the forgiveness of approximately $86 million USD in debts to the IMF, excluding the remaining assistance under HIPC. Nearly half of the government's budget is derived from foreign donor resources. Future growth may be sustained by exploitation of oil, gold, coal, and other mineral resources. Uranium prices have recovered somewhat in the last few years. A drought and locust infestation in 2005 led to food shortages for as many as 2.5 million Nigeriens.
Niger's agricultural and livestock sectors are the mainstay of all but 18% of the population. Fourteen percent of Niger's GDP is generated by livestock production-- camels , goats , sheep , and cattle --said to support 29% of the population. The 15% of Niger's land that is arable is found mainly along its southern borders with Nigeria, Benin and Burkina Faso. Rainfall varies and when insufficient, Niger has difficulty feeding its population and must rely on grain purchases and food aid to meet food requirements. Although the rains in 2000 were not good, the three following years brought relatively plentiful and well-distributed rainfall, resulting in good harvests. Millet, sorghum, and cassava are Niger's principal rain-fed subsistence crops. Cowpeas and onions are grown for commercial export, as are limited quantities of garlic, peppers, gum arabic , and sesame seeds.
Of Niger's exports, foreign exchange earnings from livestock, although difficult to quantify, are second only to those from uranium. Actual exports far exceed official statistics, which often fail to detect large herds of animals informally crossing into Nigeria. Some hides and skins are exported, and some are transformed into handicrafts.
The persistent uranium price slump has brought lower revenues for Niger's uranium sector, although uranium still provides 72% of national export proceeds. The nation enjoyed substantial export earnings and rapid economic growth during the 1960s and 1970s after the opening of two large uranium mines near the northern town of Arlit. When the uranium-led boom ended in the early 1980s, however, the economy stagnated, and new investment since then has been limited. Niger's two uranium mines--SOMAIR's open pit mine and COMINAK's underground mine--are owned by a French-led consortium and operated by French interests.
Exploitable deposits of gold are known to exist in Niger in the region between the Niger River and the border with Burkina Faso . On October 5 , 2004 President Tandja announced the official opening of the Samira Hill Gold Mine in the region of Tera and the first Nigerien gold ingot was presented to him. This marked a historical moment for Niger as the Samira Hill Gold Mine represents the first commercial gold production in the country. Samira Hill is owned by a company called SML (Societe des Mines du Liptako) which is a joint venture between a Moroccan company, Societe Semafo , and a Canadian company, Etruscan Resources . Both companies own 80% (40% - 40%) of SML and the Government of Niger 20%. The first year's production is predicted to be 135,000 troy ounces (4,200 kg; 9,260 lb avoirdupois ) of gold at a cash value of USD 177 per ounce ($5.70/g). The mine reserves for the Samira Hill mine total 10,073,626 tons at an average grade of 2.21 grams per ton from which 618,000 troy ounces (19,200 kg; 42,400 Lb) will be recovered over a 6 year mine life. SML believes to have a number of significant gold deposits within what is now recognized as the gold belt known as the "Samira Horizon".
Substantial deposits of phosphates , coal , iron , limestone , and gypsum also have been found in Niger. Niger has oil potential. In 1992, the Djado permit was awarded to Hunt Oil, and in 2003 the Tenere permit was awarded to the China National Petroleum Company. An ExxonMobil - Petronas joint venture now holds the sole rights to the Agadem block, north of Lake Chad , and oil exploration is ongoing. The parastatal SONICHAR (Societe Nigerienne de Charbon) in Tchirozerine (north of Agadez) extracts coal from an open pit and fuels an electricity generating plant that supplies energy to the uranium mines. There are additional coal deposits to the south and west that are of a higher quality and may be exploitable.
The economic competitiveness created by the January 1994 devaluation of the Communaute Financiere Africaine (CFA) franc contributed to an annual average economic growth of 3.5% throughout the mid-1990s. But the economy stagnated due to the sharp reduction in foreign aid in 1999 (which gradually resumed in 2000) and poor rains in 2000. Reflecting the importance of the agricultural sector, the return of good rains was the primary factor underlying economic growth of 5.1% in 2000, 3.1% in 2001, 6.0% in 2002, and 3.0% in 2003.
In recent years, the Government of Niger drafted revisions to the investment code (1997 and 2000), petroleum code (1992), and mining code (1993), all with attractive terms for investors. The present government actively seeks foreign private investment and considers it key to restoring economic growth and development. With the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), it has undertaken a concerted effort to revitalize the private sector.
Niger shares a common currency, the CFA franc, and a common central bank, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), with seven other members of the West African Monetary Union. The Treasury of the Government of France supplements the BCEAO's international reserves in order to maintain a fixed rate of 656 CFA to the euro.
In January 2000, Niger's newly elected government inherited serious financial and economic problems, including a virtually empty treasury, past-due salaries (11 months of arrears) and scholarship payments, increased debt, reduced revenue performance, and lower public investment. In December 2000 , Niger qualified for enhanced debt relief under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program for Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and concluded an agreement with the Fund on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). In January 2001, Niger reached its decision point and subsequently reached its completion point in 2004. Total relief from all of Niger's creditors is worth about $890 million, corresponding to about $520 million in net present value (NPV) terms, which is equivalent to 53.5% of Niger's total debt outstanding as of 2000. The debt relief provided under the enhanced HIPC initiative significantly reduces Niger's annual debt service obligations, freeing about $40 million per year over the coming years for expenditures on basic health care , primary education, HIV/AIDS prevention, rural infrastructure, and other programs geared at poverty reduction. The overall impact on Niger's budget is substantial. Debt service as a percentage of government revenue will be slashed from nearly 44% in 1999 to 10.9% in 2003 and average 4.3% during 2010 - 19 . The debt relief cuts debt service as a percentage of export revenue from more than 23% to 8.4% in 2003, and decreases it to about 5% in later years.
In addition to strengthening the budgetary process and public finances, the Government of Niger has embarked on an ambitious program to privatize 12 state-owned companies. To date, seven have been fully privatized, including the water and telephone utilities, with the remainder to be privatized in 2005. A newly installed multisectoral regulatory agency will help ensure free and fair competition among the newly privatized companies and their private sector competitors. In its effort to consolidate macroeconomic stability under the PRGF, the government is also taking actions to reduce corruption, and as the result of a participatory process encompassing civil society, has devised a Poverty Reduction Strategy Plan that focuses on improving health, primary education, rural infrastructure, agricultural production, environmental protection, and judicial reform.
The importance of external support for Niger's development is demonstrated by the fact that about 45% of the government's FY 2002 budget, including 80% of its capital budget, derived from donor resources. The most important donors in Niger are France , the European Union , the World Bank , the IMF , and UN agencies-- UNDP , UNICEF , FAO , WFP , and UNFPA . Other donors include the United States , Belgium , Germany , Switzerland , Japan , China , Italy , Libya , Egypt , Morocco , Iran , Denmark , Canada , and Saudi Arabia . While the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) does not have an office in Niger, the United States is a major donor, contributing on average $8 million each year to Niger's development increasing to $12 million in FY 2004. The United States also is a major partner in policy coordination in food security, education, water management and HIV/AIDS sectors.
Niger pursues a moderate foreign policy and maintains friendly relations with the West and the Islamic world as well as nonaligned countries. It belongs to the United Nations and its main specialized agencies and in 1980-81 served on the UN Security Council . Niger maintains a special relationship with France and enjoys close relations with its West African neighbors. It is a charter member of the African Union and the West African Monetary Union and also belongs to the Niger River and Lake Chad Basin Commissions , the Economic Community of West African States , the Nonaligned Movement , and the Organization of the Islamic Conference . The westernmost regions of Niger are joined with contiguous regions Mali and Burkina Faso under the Liptako-Gourma Authority .
The border dispute with Benin, inherited from colonial times and concerning inter alia Lete Island in the River Niger was finally solved by the ICJ in 2005 to Niger's advantage.
The Niger Armed Forces total 10,000 personnel with approximately 3,700 gendarmes, 300 air force, and 6,000 army personnel. The air force has four operational transport aircraft. The armed forces include general staff and battalion task force organizations consisting of two paratroop units, four light armored units, and nine motorized infantry units located in Tahoua, Agadez, Dirkou, Zinder, Nguigmi, N'Gourti, and Madewela. Since January 2003, Niger has deployed a company of troops to Cote d'Ivoire as part of the ECOWAS stabilization force. In 1991, Niger sent four hundred military personnel to join the American-led allied forces against Iraq during the Gulf War.
Niger's defense budget is modest, accounting for about 1.6% of government expenditures. France provides the largest share of military assistance to Niger. Morocco , Algeria , China , and Libya have also provided military assistance. Approximately 15 French military advisers are in Niger. Many Nigerien military personnel receive training in France, and the Nigerien Armed Forces are equipped mainly with material either given by or purchased in France. In the past, U.S. assistance focused on training pilots and aviation support personnel, professional military education for staff officers, and initial specialty training for junior officers. A small foreign military assistance program was initiated in 1983. A U.S. Defense Attaché office opened in June 1985 and assumed Security Assistance Office responsibilities in 1987. The office closed in 1996 following a coup d'état . A U.S. Defense Attaché office reopened in July 2000. The United States provided transportation and logistical assistance to Nigerien troops deployed to Cote d'Ivoire in 2003. Additionally, the U.S. provided initial equipment training on vehicles and communications gear to a select contingent of Nigerien soldiers as part of the Department of State Pan-Sahel Initiative .
The largest ethnic groups in Niger are the Hausa , who also constitute the major ethnic group in northern Nigeria , and the Djerma-Songhai , who also are found in parts of Mali . Both groups, along with the Gourmantche , are sedentary farmers who live in the arable, southern tier of the country. The remainder of Nigeriens are nomadic or semi-nomadic livestock-raising peoples-- Fulani , Tuareg , Kanuri , Arabs, and Toubou . With rapidly growing populations and the consequent competition for meager natural resources, lifestyles of agriculturalists and livestock herders have come increasingly into conflict in Niger in recent years.
Niger's high infant mortality rate is comparable to levels recorded in neighboring countries. However, the child mortality rate (deaths among children between the ages of 1 and 4) is exceptionally high (248 per 1,000) due to generally poor health conditions and inadequate nutrition for most of the country's children. According to the organization Save the Children , Niger has the world's highest infant mortality rate . Nonetheless, Niger has the highest fertility rate in the world (7.2 births per woman); this means that nearly half (49%) of the Nigerien population is under age 15. Between 1996 and 2003, primary school attendance was around 30% , including 36% of males and only 25% of females. Additional education occurs through madrassas .
Niger started to develop diverse media in the late 1990s. Niamey boasts scores of newspapers and magazines, many of which are fiercely critical of the government.
Radio is the most important medium, as television sets are beyond the buying power of many of the rural poor and illiteracy prevents the print media from becoming a mass medium.
As well as the national and regional radio services of the state broadcaster ORTN, there are four privately owned radio networks which total more than 100 stations.
Three of them – the Anfani Group, Sarounia and Tenere – are urban based commercial format FM networks in the major towns. There is also a network of over 80 community radio stations spread across all seven regions of the country, governed by the Comité de Pilotage de Radios de Proximité (CPRP), a civil society organisation.
The independent sector radio networks are collectively estimated by CPRP officials to cover some 7.5 million people, or about 70% of the population (2005).
As well as Nigerien radio stations, the BBC's Hausa service is listened to on FM repeaters across wide parts of the country, particularly in the south, close to the border with Nigeria. Radio France Internationale also rebroadcasts in French through some of the commercial stations, via satellite.
Despite relative freedom at the national level, Nigerien journalists say they are often pressured by local authorities. The state ORTN network depends financially on the government, partly through an addition to electricity bills and partly through direct subsidy.
The sector is governed by the Conseil Superieur de Communications, established as an independent body in the late 1990s, headed by Maryam Keita, a former TV presenter at ORTN.

elcome to the Digital Meltd0wn Music Blog. The aim of this blog is to introduce the readers to music that is out of print, commercially unavailable, released under a creative commons license, or with approval by the featured artist. The majority of the music posted here would be considered underground. Don't let that fool you into thinking that the music featured here might be any less enjoyable than that of the mainstream artists you hear on the radio, as this couldn't be further from the truth. Please keep in mind that the majority of the artists that appear on this blog, along with their respective record labels, are not wealthy and need your support. If you enjoy the material that you find here, please support the artists/labels by purchasing their material afterwards. If you are an artist/label that would prefer to have your material removed from this blog, simply leave me a comment, and I would be more than happy to promptly remove the offending post. In addition to running this blog, I also work on a few other projects during my spare time. You can find links to those, as well as a few other important links associated with Digital Meltd0wn in the menu bar above.
This will be my last post for the 2010 Halloween Countdown. It is after midnight where I'm at, which means that Halloween is technically over, but I'm one of those people who don't consider it to be over with until I finally close my eyes and go to sleep, which means that you all get one more horror-inspired post for the night. Please be sure to check out my "Post-Halloween Countdown Report" that I plan to post tomorrow. There are a few announcements I would like to make regarding my plans for the blog during November and December, as well as a few people that I would like to thank. I've had a lot of fun posting horror-related material all month long, and having the chance to interact with many of you in the process. I would like to thank both contributors and visitors alike for helping to make Digital Meltd0wn's 2010 Halloween Countdown one kick-ass event.
Those of you who follow this blog regularly should know by now that I'm a huge Lovecraft fan. In fact, I plan to put together an index of all my Lovecraftian posts next month so that you can easily find any Lovecraft-related item you might happen to be looking for here. I plan to create a "master index", as well as a sub-index for each medium, such as one for audiobooks, e-books, etc. I also plan to make a major announcement next month that will hopefully excite Lovecraft fans everywhere, so you may want to keep an eye out for that. I recently started posting the occasional digital comic download here on the blog, due in part to my own recently renewed interest in comics, as well as the unexpected interest expressed by many of the visitors here.
"H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu: The Festival" was a three part mini-series published by Millennium Productions in 1993. It is based on H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos and follows the perils faced by a group of investigators called the Mistkatonic Project. Unfortunately Millennium Comics closed its doors for good in 2000, inevitably making this comic out of print. Millennium was well known for releasing one-shots, graphic novels and mini-series, rather than primarily focusing on continuing series as most comic publishers tend to do. In addition to Cthulhu: The Festival, Millennium also released two other mini-series based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft, including "H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu" three part mini-series (1991) and "H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu: Whisperer In Darkness" 3 issue mini-series (1991). For more H.P. Lovecraft comic goodness, check out my H.P. Lovecraft Comic Book & Graphic Novel post here: http://digitalmeltd0wn.blogspot.com/2008/10/hp-lovecraft-comic-books-graphic-novels.html
I would like to thank Strange Ranger from the Motherfucker=Redeemer blog for filling the majority of these requests. Thank you so much for your help. It has certainly been appreciated.
Someone suggested that I start an open request section for the Halloween Countdown, which I thought was a fantastic idea. I wish that I had started this at the beginning of October, but I suppose its better late than never. I have also been planning on posting the items that I didn't have time to post this month in December as part of a "Nightmare Before Christmas Countdown", so I will leave this post up until then, and possibly longer. Please request anything that might be considered Halloween or horror related by posting a comment here. Requests may consist of music, e-books, audiobooks etc. as long as they are Halloween or horror related.
If you are going to request a soundtrack for a movie, please ensure that one was actually released for the film. Likewise, if you are looking for a bootleg, complete/expanded score etc. please make sure one exists before requesting it. That way our list won't be full of requests that can't possibly be filled due to the fact that they don't exist. Please try to be descriptive and specific when making your request so there won't be any doubts about exactly what it is you are requesting. I will continuously update this post to add each item that is requested. Please help me out by helping to fill the requests that are posted. I'm currently working and going to school full time, and I spend what little free time I have posting content for the blog, so it is unlikely that I will be able to fill all of the requests myself. All requests that are able to be filled will be posted in the comments section of this post. Let the requesting commence...
As I mentioned in my last post, I'm not going to be able to post all the material I had planned for Halloween. With only four hours of our most beloved holiday remaining, I'm only going to have time to throw up posts in a quick and messy fashion. Just think of the next four hours as the equivalent to me handing out treats to all who visit this blog during the final hours of Halloween.
First up is the 24k Gold Edition Soundtrack of Phatasm released by New Breed Productions in 1995. Only 2,500 copies of this version were released as part of the signature edition laserdisc Phantasm box set, making it long out of print, unavailable for purchase and extremely rare. The music was composed by Fred Myrow & Malcolm Seagrave, and the soundtrack was originally released on vinyl in 1979.
Happy Halloween freaks! I had hoped to be able to post several different items today, but it doesn't appear as if I'm going to have enough time now. Unfortunately my computer was accidentally unplugged, and everything I had been writing in preparation for today's posts was lost. I will try to make the best of the situation regarldess. Back in 2008 I posted Ennio Morricone's Original Motion Picture Soundtrack to "The Thing", which can be found here:
While checking my statistics, I recently discovered that it has since become the second most downloaded album on the entire blog. Most of the traffic is coming from people searching google for "The Thing OST". I did a search of my own which resulted in my blog showing up as the number one result out of over one million different sites for that particular search, which explains the recently influx of visitors.
A fellow by the name of The Doc recently requested that I posted this soundtrack. It is the first of three bootleg soundtracks/scores for The Thing that I plan to post. Fortunately there is more information available regarding this release than the two others I possess. It was released under the title of "The Thing: Expanded Original Motion Picture Soundtrack" by a group or individual known as PROTUB. While it is a bootleg release, it was falsely labeled and circulated as a promotional release. In fact, to this day you still find this version listed and tagged as "Promo" on several different websites. It contains 19 tracks, which is nine more than what the official original soundtrack contains, with a running time of roughly 75 minutes 45 seconds.
Unfortunately there are still a few mysteries surrounding this release as well. Most importantly, I have no idea what the source is for the extra music contained on this release. In most cases, bootleg releases contain music ripped from the music of a DVD or VHS release, with the most common method being to isolate and rip the music from the 5.1 surround sound tracks contained on the DVD. My DVD of the film is over a thousand miles away, so unfortunately I can't compare the music found on this version to the music included in the film. Perhaps someone could shed some light on the origins of the various bootleg releases in circulation for this film.
In addition to this bootleg, I also have two bootleg versions that were released under the same title, "The Thing: Complete Motion Picture Score". The first is a rip containing 17 tracks which are individually named. It primarily consists of low bitrate 128kbps MP3 files. It also includes a track containing audio from the trailer. A review I found on Rateyourmusic.com claims that this version contains music composed by John Carpenter, as well as unused music cues.
The second bootleg is only 15 tracks long, the majority of which are of a higher quality bitrate of 320kbps MP3. The tracks were not named, nor did it include custom album art. However, it does contain tracks which were not included on the two other bootlegs. I plan to post these two bootlegs eventually, although I plan to spend the rest of the day posting treats for those who visit this blog during the final hours of Halloween. I will try to post them within the next couple of days though. Once I do I all add all of the links to each post, and hopefully someone will be able to provide further information about the three versions. In the meantime, I present to you Ennio Morricone's Expanded Original Motion Picture Soundtrack to The Thing.
One of my favorite films, a 1989 cyberpunk vision of urban nightmare & bod-mod horror from avant-garde Japanese filmmaker extraordinaire Shinya Tsukamoto, filmed in 16mm. Tetsuo:The Iron Man is a nonstop barrage of nerve-shredding, mind-splitting surrealism that serves as a jarring analysis of the paranoia of industrialization. The constant manipulation of multiple cinematic techniques, including film-speed & stop motion, coupled with the film's fever-pitched assault on the senses, creates a consistently unsettling aura of impending doom.
Chu Ishikawa’s intense soundtrack is equally discordantly grating, filled with the searingly crackling & pounding sounds of scraping metal & rending tissue. It is the perfect match to the film, easily as assaulting on the ears as the film's visual scheme is on the eyes. This film & score are impossible to forget, leaving a lasting impression on those who subject themselves to its cognitive horrors, searing itself into not only your mind, but into your entire consciousness.
I made a mistake when I posted what was intended to be my final installment in the complete run of "Tales From The Crypt" comics, a series of horror comics spanning 27 issues which were published by EC Comics during the 1950s. I had intended to post issues 38-46, but ended up accidently leaving issues 42-46 out of the file I posted. Here are the final fives issues of Tales From The Crypt for your enjoyment. I covered most of the history behind the comic in my last post, so I'm simply going to copy & paste that info below to save some time. You can find the previously posted issues here:
"Despite the fact that only 27 issues were published, Tales From The Crypt managed to be one of the most influential horror comics of all time, spawning three movies, a television series on HBO and a Saturday morning cartoon.
I will be posting these 10 issues at a time, with the first collection starting at #17 and ending at #27, which were published between 1950-1953. If you are wondering why I am starting with issue #17, it is because during this time publishers would often change the name of a comic, yet keep the numbering system for issues intact. In this case the original comic was called "Crime Patrol", until issue #17 where it was changed to "Crypt of Terror". After two issues EC again changed the name to "Tales From The Crypt". The collection presented for download contains scans of both the original comics as well as reprints. I should point out that the reprints are numbered differently than the original. For example, the reprint issue #18 of Crypt of Terror, is numbered as issue #2 on the cover. I have kept the original numbering system for the issues intact, so the file names are correct, even though the reprint covers might have a different issue number. The reprints are noted in the file name and are of much better quality than the original scans. You can find a summary of the stories contained in each comic on the Wikipedia article for the comic, which I have linked to above. Below you will find an excerpt from Wikipedia covering the history of the comic and it's sibling publications. You will need a comic book reader program to view the .cbr and .cbz files. I suggest CDisplay if you only need a simple viewer, or ComicRack if you're looking for a more fully featured program, both of which are freeware programs. Below is an excerpt from Wikipedia outlining the history behind the comic:
"Tales from the Crypt is a bi-monthly horror comic anthology series that, together with its horror siblings The Haunt of Fear and The Vault of Horror were published by EC Comics in the early 1950s. Tales from the Crypt hit newsstands with its April/May 1950 issue and ceased publication with its February/March 1955 issue, producing a total of 30 issues. The title was popular, but, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, comic books came under attack from parents, clergymen, schoolteachers, and others who believed the books contributed to illiteracy and juvenile delinquency. In April and June 1954, highly publicized Congressional subcommittee hearings on the effects of comic books upon children left the industry shaken. With the subsequent imposition of a highly restrictive Comics Code, EC Comics publisher William Maxwell Gaines canceled Tales from the Crypt and its two companion titles in September 1954. All three titles have been reprinted at various times since their demise and have been adapted for television and film.
In 1950, publisher William Gaines and his editor Al Feldstein discovered they shared similar tastes in horror and began experimenting with horror tales in their crime titles. Tales from the Crypt traces its origin to a Feldstein story, "Return from the Grave!", in EC's Crime Patrol (#15, December 1949/January 1950) with the Crypt-Keeper making his debut as host. Issue #16 featured more horror tales than crime stories, and, with issue #17, the title changed from Crime Patrol to The Crypt of Terror. Due to an attempt to save money on second-class postage permits, the numbering did not change with the title, and continued as The Crypt of Terror for the next two issues. The title saw its final form, Tales from the Crypt, with issue #20, October/November, 1950." - Wikipedia
Update October 28th, 2010: This is an update to my original post from 2008 for John Carpenter's Original Motion Picture Soundtrack for Halloween. Below you will find both the original soundtrack released on vinyl in 1978, as well as the 20th Anniversary Edition released in 1998. The 20th Anniversary Edition is in 320kbps MP3, while the original is only 128kbps. I have searched all over for a higher quality version of the original soundtrack, but apparently it is much rarer than I imagined. If anyone has the original soundtrack in a higher bitrate and is willing to share, please drop a link in the comment section. I would greatly appreciate the gesture, and I'm sure the readers would also.
To conclude my trilogy of modern day monster movies, we have the granddaddy of them all, Halloween. John Carpenter's Halloween helped to revolutionize the horror film genre. It is commonly credited it as being the first slasher movie, although Mario Bava's "Bay of Blood", released in 1971, was actually the first. However, Carpenter introduced a number of elements in Halloween that would become common in many of the slasher films that followed. Despite the fact that it was shot on an extremely low budget, it remains as one of the most successful independent movies of all time, grossing $65 million dollars. It is also widely regarded by a number of critics (myself included), as one of the best, if not the best, horror movies of all time.
In addition to writing and directing Halloween, John Carpenter also composed the score for the film. He credits both Goblin and Bernard Herrmann as major influences for the composition of the score. The score helped to push a great independent movie into legendary status. It is very minimalistic, yet extremely effective in achieving it's goal of creating a feeling of anticipation and dread within the listener. Carpenter needed only a few piano medleys, coupled with electronic sound effects and synthesizers, to create one of the most chilling scores of all time. I would have liked to have written more about this soundtrack, but I'm feeling a bit under the weather at the moment. There isn't much that I can say about this essential score that hasn't already been said though. Needless to say this makes for great Halloween music, and I hope many of you will be enjoying this when that day comes. As for the sequel, here you can find John Carpenter & Alan Howarth - Halloween II: 30th Anniversary Expanded Original Motion Picture Soundtrack http://digitalmeltd0wn.blogspot.com/2010/10/john-carpenter-alan-howarth-halloween.html
Note: I will replacing this link with a new download link to a higher quality version of this tomorrow morning.
While checking my statistics I have noticed a lot of people are finding their way here via google after searching for "Halloween OST", which is understandable with Halloween being only three days away. I'm pleased to be able to deliver to you the 30th Anniversary Expanded Original Motion Picture Soundtrack to Halloween II. Those looking for John Carpenter's Original Motion Picture Soundtrack to the original 1978 Halloween can find it here: http://digitalmeltd0wn.blogspot.com/2008/10/john-carpenter-halloween-ost.html
In 1981 John Carpenter released Halloween II, the sequel to one of the horror genre's most acclaimed films of all time. The original Halloween became the most successful independent film of all time shortly after hitting the theaters in 1978, and quickly gained a massive cult following. One aspect of the film that helped to create the extremely tense atmosphere of dread was the music composed by John Carpenter & Alan Howarth. The soundtrack for the film managed to transcend the film it was composed for, and gained a cult following of its own. Carpenter's Halloween Theme has since become synonymous with the the Halloween holiday, and is one of the most recognizable film themes from any genre.
When Carpenter started working on the sequel, he decided to revisit the themes from the original due to their effectiveness and popularity. Rather than using the exact same music, he chose to compose variations of his original compositions, particularly the main theme's familiar piano melody played in a 5/4 time rhythm, which was performed on a synthesizer organ rather than a piano. The use of a more modern synthesizer and the changes in composition gave the theme an overall darker and more gothic tone to it than the original. Carpenter performed the score with the assistance of Alan Howarth, who would go on to work with Carpenter on many future projects, such as Escape from New York, The Thing and Christine. In addition to Howarth and Carpenters music, the soundtrack also includes The Chordettes song "Mr. Sandman", which sharply contrasts with the darker elements of the film and music. It was used to accompany the scenes in the film in which the character of Laurie Strode frequently loses and regains consciousness.
The 30th Anniversary Expanded Edition was released in very limited numbers, with only 1,000 being produced. Needless to say this out or print and physical copies are extremely rare. Not only does this edition contain the remastered original 1981 Halloween II soundtrack, but it also includes a special suite of seven tracks, consisting of the entire film score sequenced in chronological order, along with previously unreleased music. Needless to say this is absolutely essential listening for any horror fan, and hopefully this will satisfy those of you who have been searching google for the soundtrack to Halloween.
Continuing where I left off with my last post, I present to you the third volume in the Main Titles From Unreleased Horror Scores collection. I gave a brief description of the collection in my original post, so in order to save myself some time, I am simply going to copy & paste it to each subsequent post. You can find the download links to "Main Titles From Unreleased Horror Scores Volumes I, II and IV below:
Back in March of 2008 the Unreleased Horror Scores blog posted several volumes of "Main Titles From Unreleased Horror Scores" compilations. Unfortunately the download links posted on his blog have been dead for some time now. I will be posting the first five volumes from this collection tonight and tomorrow. While the title of the compilation states that these are from unreleased horror scores, several of these scores actually have been released. These are actually audio rips from VHS tapes of each of the films. While I'm sure this brings up dreadful visions of horrible sound quality, the quality isn't as bad as you would imagine. These actually sound fairly decent considering they are VHS audio rips, aside from a couple of tracks which have some distortion and background noise. The low quality recordings actually compliment the creepy atmosphere created by the music in some cases, as with Carl Zittrer's organ themes for Deranged.
As I mentioned before, the download links on the Unreleased Horror Scores blog have been dead for some time now. Fortunately the Egg City Radio blog re-uploaded the first five volumes and added tags to the tracks. I went a step further and retagged it once again. I added the proper artists to each track, corrected the titles and made a few other slight alterations. These compilations have generated a fair amount of interest, and I'm glad that I am able to help keep them alive for those interested.
Each of these compilations features a remarkable array of music from various horror films, the majority of which are main and end titles from the films. While the majority of the music contained within these collections is fantastic, there are also a few selections that leave much to be desired. There is a wide range of films from all over the world represented in each compilation, from popular horror films familiar to all, to those that have been long forgotten by all but a few. These compilations are essential listening for any horror fan.
Continuing where I left off with my last post, I present to you the second volume in the Main Titles From Unreleased Horror Scores collection. This is the second volume of five that I will be posting here. I gave a brief description of the collection in my original post, so in order to save myself some time, I am simply going to copy & paste it to each subsequent post. You can find the download links to "Main Titles From Unreleased Horror Scores Volumes I, III and IV below:

Several of you have requested soundtracks to films released by Hammer Film Productions, and I'm pleased to be able to present an excellent collection of music from three of the four Quatermass films released by Hammer during the '50s and '60s. The Quatermass films were part of a science-fiction horror series that revolved around the aftermath of a lethal extraterrestrial fungus brought back to Earth by the sole survivor of an outer space expedition. These films helped to put Hammer on the map, and many consider them to be among the best films that Hammer ever produced. The Hammer Quatermass Film Music Collection contains both Tristram Cary's original electronic scores, as well as James Bernard's orchestral scores composed for the following Hammer films: The Quatermass Experiment (1956) Quatermass II (1957) and Quatermass and the Pit (1967)
The music from the films is introduced in reverse chronological order, with Tristram Cary's electronic score for "Quatermass & The Pit" up first. The music from this film makes up the bulk of the collection, while only a few minutes of music from "Quatermass II" and "The Quatermass Experiment" are presented. This is my only complaint regarding the collection, as the quality of the music more than makes up for the lack of equal representation. James Bernard's orchestral score to "Quatermass II" is the second to appear, with three tracks which clock in at just over two minutes in total length. It is followed by another score from James Bernard for the film "Quatermass II". Again, most of the cues are very short, and the seven tracks total slightly less than three minutes in length. "Quatermass & The Pit" appears once again, with various electronic music sessions
from Tristram Carry finishing off the collection. All of the tracks featured in the collection have been digitally restored from their original recordings and sound fantastic.
I had intended to wait until I had both the FLAC and 320kbps mp3 versions uploaded before I created this post. I uploaded the FLAC version last night, and the plan was to start the 320kbps upload before I left for school. As luck would have it, my computer froze up, so I had to just leave without starting the upload. I will upload the 320kbps version as soon as I get home from school this afternoon, and post the download link as soon as it finishes uploading.
and with only six days left it is becoming increasingly obvious that I am not going to have time to post all of the material that I would have liked to. Regardless of that fact it has still been a good run. Last September we made the most posts this blog had seen in almost two years, and we have exceeded that total once again this month. The request thread has been a welcome addition, and I would like to thank Strange Ranger from the Motherfucker=Redeemer blog once again for doing such a great job of helping to fill the majority of the requests that have been made.
I'm pleased to be able to present another audiobook for all you Lovecraft fans out there. This is actually a re-up of one of the numerous audiobooks I posted for the H.P. Lovecraft audiobooks mega-post This one features Jeffrey Combs, best known for playing the role of Dr. Herbert West in Stuart Gordon's 1985 film "Re-Animator", reading H.P. Lovecraft's 1922 short story "Herbert West-Reanimator." I can't think of too many people that would be more fitting to read this story than the man who has become synonymous with the character of Dr. Herbert West. Lovecraft originally serialized the story in Home Brew Vol. 1, No. 1–6, an amateur magazine published by his friend George Julian Houtain. The tracks are split up and given the same names as those originally used by Lovecraft. This audiobook recording was released by Beyond Books in 1999 and has been out of print for some time now.
Here is the final installment, covering issues #38-46, of the complete run of Tales From the Crypt comics published by EC Comics from 1950-1955. You can find issues #17-27 posted here, and issues #28-37 posted here. I covered most of the history behind the comic in my last post, so I'm simply going to copy & paste that info below to save some time. You can find the other issues in the series here:
I will be posting these 10 issues at a time, with the first collection starting at #17 and ending at #27, which were published between 1950-1953. If you are wondering why I am starting with issue #17, it is because during this time publishers would often change the name of a comic, yet keep the numbering system for issues intact. In this case the original comic was called "Crime Patrol", until issue #17 where it was changed to "Crypt of Terror". After two issues EC again changed the name to "Tales From The Crypt".

Update: A couple of readers informed me that the archive is missing files 42-46. I will be uploading this on the morning of October 31st and adding them to this post. I apologize for the inconvenience.
I was shocked to discover that I had not already posted this soundtrack, which is possibly one of the greatest horror scores to never see an official release. I am presenting two different versions of this bootleg soundtrack to you today. The first version comes courtesy of Shelby Cobras from the Illogical Contraption blog, which is a great blog that you should definitely pay a visit if you haven't already. The second comes from a fellow known for creating a massive number of bootleg soundtrack releases, "Chief Brody", who also runs a blog which can be found here. Chief Brody's version is entitled "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: Expanded Motion Picture Score" and contains 15 tracks in total. I tagged and properly named the tracks according to the tracklist provided by Chief Brody on the cover art he created. The Illogical Contraption version contains a total of 11 tracks, including the opening narration by John Larroquette, and the upbeat little number "Fool For A Blond" by Roger Bartlett, both of which appeared in the film. While "Fool For A Blond" isn't a bad song at all, it does contrast sharply with the rest of the music on the soundtrack, detracting from the chilling atmosphere created by the weird experimental music of Hooper and Bell. Since the soundtrack was never officially released, the tracks were never given official names. The track names differ on both bootleg releases because both rippers had to name the tracks as they saw fit. Both versions were ripped to 320kbps mp3 and sound as good as a bootleg audio rip from a low-budget mid-70s film can possibly be.
The soundtrack that accompanied the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was made up 7 original songs by various artists from Texas and an original background effects track by Tobe Hooper and Wayne Bell. Kim Henkel and Tobe Hooper have both stated that neither have any recollection as to what happened to the original vinyl copies of the music used for the film. Kim Henkel is in possesion of the optical track containing the master soundtrack to the film, however, this track and any other significant copies of the film do not contain any audio track separation of the songs, background music, effects or dialogue. The original film contained only one mono track with the master audio, again with no separation between music, dialogue, etc.
While we may not have the isolated score created by Wayne Bell and Toby Hooper, the music, dialogue and sound effects contained in these bootlegs still manage to be every bit as creepy as the movie they accompanied.
Bell and Hooper created some of the most unnerving and creepy backing tracks to ever appear in a horror film. They incorporated a wide variety of unconventional instruments, ranging from cymbals to African instruments, and sound effects. For example, the screeching you hear during Sally's encounter with the Grandparents and at the end of the credits was made by running a pitch fork along the edge of a table. As with the film editing, the sound editing solely took place in Tobe Hooper's living room.
I would like to thank Chief Brody and Shelby Cobras for taking the time to create these and making them available to the rest of us. I would also like to thank Tim Harden from texaschainsawmassacre.net for providing some of the background information about the creative process behind the music.
Here is the second installment in what will eventually be the complete run of Tales From the Crypt comics published by EC Comics from 1950-1955. I had originally planned to post the entire run of both "The Haunt of Fear" and "The Vault of Horror" also, but it doesn't look like I will have time before Halloween arrives. I posted the first 11 issues (#17-27) in my last post. Below you will find the next 10 issues in the series (#28-37). I covered most of the history behind the comic in my last post, so I'm simply going to copy & paste that info below to save some time. You can find the rest of the issues I posted here:
Penis Flytrap is a name that will make any man fear for his crotch. Fortunately their music makes up for their cringe-inducing name. I wanted to go with something a bit more fun, but not too over the top to contrast with my last post. While Penis Flytrap may not be a name that many people are familiar with, some of you may be more familiar with the lead singer, Dinah Cancer. For the uninitiated, Dinah Cancer is the legendary former lead singer for 45 Grave, and considered to be one of the pioneers of the Deathrock genre. I've always been quite fond of her instantly recognizable voice, which has such a sinister quality to it that I really love.
Ironically Penis Flytrap wasn't the first band Cancer belonged whose name promoted violence towards the male reproductive organ. In the early 80s she broke into the music scene with the all female punk band, the Castration Squad, which was formed by Alice Bag of The Bags. She played a small role in other projects before joining the band that most would associate her with, 45 Grave. 45 Grave are considered on of the originators of Deathrock and helped form the style and sound that would become known as Goth. 45 Grave came to an unlikely end in 1991 shortly after lead-singer Rob Graves decided to ignore his doctor's advice and up his daily dosage of heroine slightly too much. Nearly 13 years, Cancer, along with Rikk Agnew of Christian Death, reformed 45 Grave with a new lineup.
For years Cancer turned down offers to return to the music scene, stating that she wanted to wait till her daughters were old enough to understand what she was doing. After a 7 year hiatus she finally joined the group Penis Flytrap. Only one album was released with Cancer on board before she left along with drummer Hal Satan to form Dinah Cancer and the Grave Robbers. As I mentioned before, these albums manage to be enjoyable, and manage to strike a fine balance, remaining dark and enjoyable without crossing into the territory of cheesiness. The songs are all based on various horror-inspired subjects, with a nice touch of black humor thrown in for good measure.
According to a message posted on the band's official myspace page, all three albums by Penis Flytrap are currently out of print. They announced that Dismemberment was going to be re-released with brand new artwork, but it is beginning to look like that might not ever happen.
Sown are the seeds of doom. That's right freaks, it's time for some doom metal. Up till this point I have primarily been sharing soundtracks to horror films, but I would like to take the time to share a few of my favorite bands with a penchant for the dark side. In addition to doom metal I will focus on a few of my favorite deathrock/horror punk albums, and maybe even an old school black metal album or two.
First up is one of the best doom metal groups to come out of Finland within recent years, Fall of the Idols. Fall of the Idols hail from Tornio, Finland. They formed in 2000, and went on to release their first demo, the appropriately titled "Demo2002", in 2002. It would be nearly four years later before the group released their first full length album "The Womb of the Earth" on I Hate Records in 2006. I was given permission to post this album almost two years ago, but I have a bad habit of trying to establish a flow with my selections here, and unfortunately this almost didn't happen to fit in with what I was doing at the time. However, I can't think of a better time to post this than now, as some of you may be a bit more receptive with it being close to Halloween and all. I can't think of many other doom metal albums that would be more perfect for the occasion.
When it comes to metal my decision on whether I keep or discard an album tends to live and die by the vocalist. There are plenty of bands that can deliver the crushing sound of impending doom, however, many of these groups lack a vocalist that can compliment the sound. Fortunately Jyrki Hakomäki possesses one of the most gifted voices in the genre, displaying great range when the need arises. Most importantly though, his vocal style perfectly compliments the massive, ominous sound being generated by his bandmates. For those of you looking for a group with an unapologeticly dark sound with absolutely crushing riffs, this album is for you. As always, if you enjoy this please be sure to show your support by purchasing their albums/merchandise.
While the duo of composer Richard Band and director Stuart Gordon have already appeared several times on the Countdown, I couldn't resist sharing one of their lesser known collaborations. As with the previous soundtracks I shared, this film also seeks to pay homage to the work of H.P. Lovecraft. Unfortunately I haven't had the chance to watch this film yet, and while I prefer not to share soundtracks to films that I haven't watched, I chose to put this up regardless because I know there are several fans of Band, Gordon and Lovecraft who frequent this blog. Castle Freak was released in 1995, and is roughly based on H.P. Lovecraft's short-story "The Outsider", which was written in 1921 and first published in "Weird Tales" magazine in 1927. If you're interested in downloading the e-book or listening to the audiobook of "The Outsider" you can find both here on this blog by doing a quick search (top right).
Band's score for Castle Freak features some of his most powerful pieces, as well as some of the most delicate he has ever produced. The first half of the soundtrack is a showcase of power, and helps to further characterize the 12th century castle and the freak that lives within. Since I haven't watched the film, I can't even begin to speculate about the nature of the scenes which feature the more delicate cues, which is one reason I prefer not to review soundtracks to films that I haven't had a chance to watch. While this may not be Band's best effort, it is certainly worthy of the Halloween Countdown, and one does not need to be a fan of his work to enjoy this. This soundtrack was released by Intrada in 1995, and is currently out of print and unavailable for purchase on the Intrada website.
This will be the last soundtrack I post for the "Attack of the Sequels" theme. With only nine days left till the end of the countdown I would like to share some soundtracks from lesser-known movies, and a few of my favorite deathrock/horror punk and doom metal albums, along with a few other treats. I recently posted Christopher Young's score to "A Nightmare on Elm Street", and while it remains one of the most amazing scores to a horror film in its own right, it would be nearly three years before Young achived the recognition he truly deserved. This would come in the form of his score to Clive Barker's Hellraiser. I have read many other bloggers describe music as "Lovecraftian", particularly black metal albums, and to be honest I never understood the connection. I couldn't imagine Lovecraft being a fan of black metal if he were alive today, nor do I think it represents style of horror very well. If any music sounds "Lovecraftian" to me it would be Christopher Young's music for the Hellraiser series, and I believe Lovecraft would agree were he alive today. This truly sounds like the soundtrack to hell. It is a score that is grandiose in scale, and creates an atmosphere that is equally mysterious and terrifying.
It was extremely difficult for me to track down a high quality version of this soundtrack. The original soundtrack also contained music from a film called "Highpoint", which was excluded by the original ripper, which is to the benefit of the listener in my opinion. I'm not necessarily saying that the music from Highpoint is bad, just that it is dramatically different from the music of Hellraiser, and only serves to detract from the overall listening experience one is left with after listening to the music from Hellraiser. I know that not everyone is a big fan of FLAC, so I went ahead and converted the original FLAC files to 320kbps mp3 for those of you who prefer the mp3 format. Enjoy!
Many of you left comments expressing your gratitude for the "Creepy" and "Eerie" horror comics that I recently posted. While I believe that Creepy and Eerie are two of the best horror comics to ever see print, I would like to add a bit of variety here before the Halloween Countdown ends. Several of you have requested that I post a few of the horror titles that EC Comics released beginning in the early 1950s. I hope to be able to share the complete run of the three titles that most people are familiar with, "Tales From the Crypt", "Vault of Horror", and "The Haunt of Fear". I will start with the most well known title of the three "Tales From The Crypt". Despite the fact that only 27 issues were published, Tales From The Crypt managed to be one of the most influential horror comics of all time, spawning three movies, a television series on HBO and a Saturday morning cartoon.
I will be posting these 10 issues at a time, with the first collection starting at #17 and ending at #27, which were published between 1950-1953. If you are wondering why I am starting with issue #17, it is because during this time publishers would often change the name of a comic, yet keep the numbering system for issues intact. In this case the original comic was called "Crime Patrol", until issue #17 where it was changed to "Crypt of Terror". After two issues EC again changed the name to "Tales From The Crypt". The collection presented for download contains scans of both the original comics as well as reprints. The reprints are noted in the file name and are of much better quality than the original scans. You can find a summary of the stories contained in each comic on the Wikipedia article for the comic, which I have linked to above. Below you will find an excerpt from Wikipedia covering the history of the comic and it's sibling publications. You will need a comic book reader program to view the .cbr and .cbz files. I suggest CDisplay if you only need a simple viewer, or ComicRack if you're looking for a more fully featured program, both of which are freeware programs.
I generally try to refrain from boring you all with details about my personal life, but sometimes it is a necessary evil. The reason I mention this is because the end of October is almost here, which means that this year's Halloween Countdown is winding down. There are a lot of amazing albums that I would like to share with you, but I'm simply not going to have the time unless I alter my approach a bit. I'm two weeks away from graduating college, although I will have to attend for a few more months so that I can get a higher degree. I'm a hair away from graduating number one in my class and being awarded Valedictorian honors, so I don't want to do anything to screw it up at this point, which means that my focus needs to be on school for the time being. I've been putting in 75 hours a week between work and school for a long time, so it can be very tough to find the time to ensure that the blog stays updated. From this point on I won't have time to post full reviews to accompany the albums I share, unless I have a day off, although I will still take the time to put up a track list and some basic info about the release.
With that in mind, I present to you the latest soundtrack sequel in our ongoing "Attack of the Sequels" theme for Halloween Countdown, Joseph LoDuca's soundtrack to "Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn". The track listing provided below may be a little different than the one for the download I provided, but I am at school at the moment, so I'm unable to look at the tracks in the archive that I uploaded. I'll be sure to edit the post if need be whenever I get home though.
The next soundtrack in our sequence of sequels was for a film that introduced the world to one of the most iconic slasher villains in horror history, Jason Vorhees. While he did appear as a child for a brief moment at the end of the original film, F13 Part II was the first film in the franchise that featured Jason as the killer. Considered by many to be the counterpart franchise to the subject of my last post, A Nightmare on Elm Street, the Friday the 13th series would also become one of the most popular horror franchises in existence. While most are most famliar with Jason being portrayed as a hockey mask wearing killer, he sported a different look in the early years of the franchise. While donning a burlap sack over his head, the pre-hockey mask wearing Jason dispatched sex-starved teens in a variety of creative ways thoughout Friday the 13th Part 2, a plot that would be rehashed time and time again throughout the series.
Harry Manfredini was chosen to compose the score for the original Friday the 13th film, and would go on to deliver one of the most recognizable scores for any film. His trademark "ki ki ki, ma ma ma" sound, which he created by running his voice through an echo reverberation machine, along with his manic score became synonymous with Friday the 13th and Jason Vorhees. Fortunately for horror fans everywhere Harry Manfredini was brought back on board to compose the score to the sequel, which guaranteed that the film would contain an atmosphere of dread regardless of what was taking place on the screen. F13 Part II turned out to be one of the better films in the franchise though, containing a number of legitimately scary moments, and a plot that hadn't entirely reached the point of self-parody. I have always thought that Manfredini's scores for Friday the 13th were easily some of the most frightening, intense, and creepy scores in the genre. Manfredini chose not to deviate much from his original formula for each of his scores for the series, instead adding minor variations and alterations to adapt the score to the respective film he was working on. I believe that the score for Part II may be the best of the bunch though, as it has a slightly different edge to it than the original. Manfredini turns up the level of agression a bit more for this score, and it seems much more thunderous than the first as well.
I would like to thank the Long Island Ripper and Starman1975 for making this score available. Long Island Ripper runs an amazing blog called The Inferno Music Vault, which can be found here. I believe that Starman1975 was responsible for the rip, or at least submitting it to the Inferno Music Vault. The score was isolated and ripped from the 5.1 surround sound of the Deluxe Edition DVD of the film. Though I'm no audiophile, it sounds absolutely perfect to me, regardless of the 192kbps bitrate. The first track is a dialogue sequence from the beginning of the film where the group is gathered around a campfire listening to a story about the legend of Jason. The rest of the album contains all of the music from the film without dialogue or sound effects.

Microsoft senior program manager Chris Riggs revealed information about the company’s Windows 10 update and upgrade in a presentation at the WinHEC technical conference in Taiwan.
While Riggs addressed business and Enterprise customers in the Windows As A Service presentation, some of it is also interesting to Home users.
Microsoft plans to release single cumulative updates each month, and so-called feature updates twice a year.
These cumulative updates are already used by the company. They supersede the previous month’s update, and contain only security, reliability or bug fixes according to Microsoft.
Feature updates on the other hand, with the next major one called the Anniversary Update out in July 2016, ship with new features and capabilities but are released less frequently.
Microsoft attempts to use the same timeline for each Windows 10 feature build that follows the scheme evaluate, pilot and deploy/use.
After six or more months of active development and testing using the Insider program, the new feature release is published to Current Branch systems.
The update is distributed to most consumer editions of Windows at this point in time. Windows 10 Home users have no option but to accept the update, while Pro, Education and Enterprise customers can configure the operating system to defer upgrades.
Microsoft notes that each Windows 10 release has its own lifecycle, and that they all start as Current Branch releases and proceed to Current Branch for Business afterwards.
There is also a Long Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) but it is limited to Enterprise customers. The core difference is that Long Term Servicing Branch systems don’t require feature upgrade installations to stay supported.
Windows 10 Pro, Education and Enterprise systems can be configured to defer upgrades. Note that Microsoft makes a clear distinction between updates and upgrades, with the former referring to monthly updates and the latter to the bi-annual feature releases,
There you find listed the Defer upgrades option. Check it to skip feature upgrades during the pilot phase.
You may also configure the defer upgrades option using the Group Policy Editor instead. It offers better customization options.
Tap on the Windows-key, type gpedit.msc and hit enter. This should open the Group Policy Editor. Note that the editor is not available on Home systems.
Now you can defer upgrades (the bi-annual feature upgrades) by months, and updates (monthly fixes and patches) for weeks.
The same policy holds an option to pause upgrades and updates. This blocks updates and upgrades “until the next monthly update or upgrade becomes available”. The value resets automatically when that happens.
Also, Windows Defender definition updates are not blocked if the policy is enabled. Defer upgrades and updates has no effect if the “allow Telemetry” policy is enabled and set to the value of 0.
‘’I can hardly imagine my life before vlogging everything.’’ One year ago Diana Leeflang (23) decided to quit her studies to fully focus on her YouTube channel, D is for Dazzle.
The documentary Non Stop shows the increasing pressure in the life of a fulltime YouTuber. While YouTube is changing fast and the competition is getting bigger, Diana has to defend herself to people who don’t take her job serious. ‘’How is this a 40 hour job?’’ and ‘’You must think a whole lot of yourself to film yourself.’’ ‘’Vlogging has become a dirty word.’’ Diana says.
When Diana was younger she used to be a shy girl. Now she has grown into a confident young woman. With her YouTube channel Diana wants to be an example to her young public. Still she finds it hard to decide what to share and what she wants to keep private.
Red stripes are what I had on my feet after wearing sandals in the hot sun on the black top all day for my first long day in the summer sun.

While there was nothing resembling organization at my second adventure in the Paul M Summer Tour Series, there were LOTS of feathers to make up for that.

Treating wastewater collected from the industrial, commercial and household structures is the most usual application of a water treatment plant. The physical, chemical, biological and radioactive pollutants are removed that are present in the wastewater. Two commonly used treatment processes followed here are sludge treatment and sewage treatment.
This process may be followed by a plant to cleanse surface water for municipal usage. In this process, the colloidal matters, organic components and suspended impurities present in the surface water are usually removed using treatment processes like screening, aeration, sedimentation, sand filtration and disinfection.Read Related

22:16. I JESUS HAVE SENT MINE ANGEL TO TESTIFY UNTO YOU THESE THINGS. The things that the angel was sent to testify are covered in Rev 1:1. They are the things which must shortly come to pass.
Jesus had sent His angel to testify (or to expound) unto John the Revelation, so that it would be taught
IN THE CHURCHES (or to give you this testimony for the churches-NIV). The Revelation is to be taught in the seven churches.
Incredible as it may seem in this Laodicean church age, many churches that teach Jesus is the only way to be saved will not teach on the Revelation. They use the same excuses that the unbelievers use.
Clearly, God will not lead a preacher contrary to His Word. Yet, in this age of deception, many Bible teachers actually believe God is leading them not to read or teach the Revelation to their people, even though this is contrary to the Scriptures. The Spirit of God will not lead someone to do contrary to God's Word. Know this, it is written, FOR AS MANY AS ARE LED BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD, THEY ARE THE SONS OF GOD-Ro 8:14.
This is the age of religious deception. Like leaven, it thrives in the Bible schools and continues down through the preachers and on to the people. The deception of this church age is great. Many churches today teach about Jesus, but they will not be raptured. They teach Jesus, but they do not follow Jesus. They will go into the Tribulation. When the Antichrist comes on the scene, their understanding will be so darkened and deceived, they will not even recognize who this man of sin is.
Rev 1:1-THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST, WHICH GOD GAVE UNTO HIM, TO SHOW UNTO HIS SERVANTS THINGS WHICH MUST SHORTLY COME TO PASS; AND HE SENT AND SIGNIFIED IT BY HIS ANGEL UNTO HIS SERVANT JOHN. One of the purposes of the Revelation is to show the servants of Jesus Christ certain things. The Revelation is not for unbelievers, but for those who, when the Lord comes, shall be found watching and so doing. The Revelation gives future events, which are absolutely certain to come to pass. Even as the Revelation was being written, some of the prophecies were already beginning to transpire. The Father gave it to Jesus. Jesus delivered it to the angel. The angel revealed it to John, and John made it known to the servants of God through the written Word. The Revelation is to be taught to the servants of God in today’s churches. Clearly, something is wrong if a preacher will not teach the Revelation.
Rev 1:3-BLESSED IS HE THAT READETH, AND THEY THAT HEAR THE WORDS OF THIS PROPHECY, AND KEEP THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN THEREIN: FOR THE TIME IS AT HAND. A special blessing is promised to the individuals that read or hear the words of this prophecy and also keep the things written therein. Note, the verse said, HE THAT READETH, AND THEY THAT HEAR THE WORDS OF THIS PROPHECY. The book of the Revelation is also called "THIS PROPHECY." The importance of the Revelation being taught in the churches today is critical, as THE TIME IS AT HAND. Clearly, something is wrong if a preacher will not teach the Revelation.
Rev 1:4-JOHN TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES. Again, it is noted that the Revelation is to be taught to the servants of God in today’s churches. Clearly, something is wrong if a preacher will not teach the Revelation.
Rev 1:11-SAYING, I AM ALPHA AND OMEGA…WRITE IN A BOOK, AND SEND IT UNTO THE SEVEN CHURCHES. Again, it is noted that the Revelation is to be taught to the servants of God in today’s churches. Clearly, something is wrong if a preacher will not teach the Revelation.
Rev 3:14-AND UNTO THE ANGEL OF THE CHURCH OF THE LAODICEANS WRITE; THESE THINGS SAITH THE AMEN, THE FAITHFUL AND TRUE WITNESS, THE BEGINNING OF THE CREATION OF GOD. This is the age of the Laodicean church that is seeing the fulfillment of many prophecies, which show clearly that the horrible Tribulation period is at hand. Again, it is noted that the Revelation is to be taught to the servants of God in today’s churches. Clearly, something is wrong if a preacher will not teach the Revelation.
Rev 3:22-HE THAT HATH AN EAR, LET HIM HEAR WHAT THE SPIRIT SAITH UNTO THE CHURCHES. The letter is addressed to the church in general; however, the message is directed to the individual—"HE" that hath an ear. Not everyone has an "ear" or a heart to hear God’s Word. These verses are not addressed to the unbeliever or the make-believe Christian; they are directed to the believers, the church. Even some that are believers can become hardened toward God’s Word and turn away. They no longer have an ear to hear correction. They no longer have a discerning heart to examine themselves by God’s Word to see their true position with Him. They can no longer discern right and wrong by God’s Word. Therefore, both collectively and individually, they are being told, "HE THAT HATH AN EAR," or a heart to understand, "LET HIM HEAR." The Spirit of God is speaking. These same words are repeated in all seven churches. Note the word "churches" is used at the end. It is plural. While each church does cover events from a specific age, each letter is also intended for all church ages to consider and learn from. Again, it is noted that the Revelation is to be taught to the servants of God in today’s churches. Clearly, something is wrong if a preacher will not teach the Revelation.
Rev 19:10-FOR THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS IS THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY. The purpose of prophecy is to testify of Jesus and glorify Him. "The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
The Old Testament often foretold of the first coming of Jesus. To our generation, prophecy tells of the second coming of Jesus. Again, it is noted that the Revelation is to be taught in today’s churches. Clearly, something is wrong if a preacher will not teach the Revelation.
Rev 22:6-AND HE SAID UNTO ME, THESE SAYINGS ARE FAITHFUL AND TRUE: AND THE LORD GOD OF THE HOLY PROPHETS SENT HIS ANGEL TO SHOW UNTO HIS SERVANTS THE THINGS WHICH MUST SHORTLY BE DONE (or happen soon, or take place). God's Word is perfect and true. What He said will certainly come to pass and can be trusted. The Revelation is shown to "His servants," to those that are taught by the Spirit. The importance of these things being taught is so great, God sent His angel to show them. God’s wants His people to know and understand what must take place soon as related in the Scriptures and specifically in the Revelation. Again, it is noted that the Revelation is to be taught to the servants of God in today’s churches. Clearly, something is wrong if a preacher will not teach the Revelation.
Rev 22:7-BEHOLD, I COME QUICKLY: BLESSED IS HE THAT KEEPETH THE SAYINGS OF THE PROPHECY OF THIS BOOK. A person can be hindered from keeping the sayings of the Revelation if his church will not teach it. The Revelation is to be taught to the servants of God in today’s churches. Clearly, something is wrong if a preacher will not teach the Revelation.
Rev 22:10-AND HE SAITH UNTO ME, SEAL NOT THE SAYINGS OF THE PROPHECY OF THIS BOOK: FOR THE TIME IS AT HAND. The Revelation is not a sealed book. It was given to John to be understood; however, the understanding is reserved for "His servants." Correct understanding of much of the Revelation is hidden from those that are not His servants. The Revelation contains prophecy; it covers the past, present, and future. The fulfillment of these prophecies is now at hand. Therefore, the meaning of the book is not withheld from the saints. Again, it is noted that the Revelation is to be taught to the servants of God. Clearly, something is wrong if a preacher will not teach the Revelation.
Rev 22:16-I JESUS HAVE SENT MINE ANGEL TO TESTIFY UNTO YOU THESE THINGS IN THE CHURCHES. Jesus sent His angel to testify (or to expound) unto John the Revelation so that it would be taught in the seven churches. Again, it is noted that the Revelation is to be taught in today’s churches. Clearly, something is wrong if a preacher will not teach the Revelation.
Rev 22:18,19-FOR I TESTIFY UNTO EVERY MAN THAT HEARETH THE WORDS OF THE PROPHECY OF THIS BOOK, IF ANY MAN SHALL ADD UNTO THESE THINGS, GOD SHALL ADD UNTO HIM THE PLAGUES THAT ARE WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK: AND IF ANY MAN SHALL TAKE AWAY FROM THE WORDS OF THE BOOK OF THIS PROPHECY, GOD SHALL TAKE AWAY HIS PART OUT OF THE BOOK OF LIFE, AND OUT OF THE HOLY CITY, AND FROM THE THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN THIS BOOK. A grave warning is given; it might be called a warning of doom. There are people in this generation that have committed this sin. There are those that have rewritten the Bible and even left out this verse. God's warning is, do not tamper with the prophecy of this book (the Revelation)! The Revelation is to be taught to the servants of God in today’s churches. Clearly, something is wrong if a preacher will not teach the Revelation.
The Laodicean church age, which we are now in, is to take heed to this book. Woe unto them that refuse to teach this book, that warn against the study of this book, that falsely say this book cannot be understood. Woe to them that say the time is not at hand, that teach contrary to this book, that say this book is not inspired.
It may be said, one way the Adversary causes preachers to take away from the words of the Revelation is not to teach it at all. Thus, the preacher leaves his congregation in darkness regarding many things that Jesus has ordained to be taught.
Deut 12:32-WHAT THING SOEVER I COMMAND YOU, OBSERVE TO DO IT: THOU SHALT NOT ADD THERETO, NOR DIMINISH FROM IT. Ministers that will not teach the Revelation would do well to take heed to these words.
The Word of God has made it very clear: the Revelation is to be taught in His churches. It is Satan’s desire that it not be taught, or that it be taught incorrectly.

Fire walls, fire balls, and just plain fire. You can use your dragon to defeat the evil armies, but fly like an eagle to avoid their bullets. Will you go down in a blaze of glory?
i don't know what problem people have with this game. i love it! i mean it's a dragon, for god's sake.
It's hard to find a good adventure game. this game is just okay with me. rather boring and hard. And the plot is stupid. there should be unlimited fireball power er whatever. at least one kind. overall boring *yawn*

The strategy dispute in the publishing industry: Drive diversity? Or focus on the core business? And how to increase efficiency in either case!
Within the IPE initiative Jens Nebe has taken the role of coordinating the working group looking at the interoperability challenges between publishers and printing houses. Jens Nebe is Executive Vice President of GGP Media GmbH responsible for sales and pre press. Over the past 25 years Jens Nebe has served in management positions in print and IT entities of the Bertelsmann group both in Germany and Internationally.
He holds Master Degrees in electronic engineering and business administration from the Technical University Darmstadt, Germany.
Most companies foster digitalization only within their respective enterprise. But thinking outside the box of their own company is vital in order to make the digital transformation a success, and to thrive in the process. Interoperability is key. Organizations along the entire value chain in publishing, and from several countries started an initiative aiming at „Integrating the Publishing Environment“, in order to develop open standard interfaces to make interoperability happen. Jens Nebe and Dr. Julius Mittenzwei are the champions of the first two working groups Printing and Logistics. They will provide practical insights, explain the need for this initiative, and report about what has happend so far.

A web log, an æthereal scrap-book if you will, with a somewhat vintage flavour. News items, occurrences, experiences, thoughts and opinions related to Victoriana through to Fifties Americana can all be found here.
If I've worked out Blogger's Scheduled Post function correctly then thanks to the wonders of modern technology this post should appear while I am still laid up in hospital. We haven't had an excerpt from the 1940s Fashion Sourcebook for a while and as it lends itself to the kind of simple, straightforward pre-planned post now would seem to be the perfect time to revisit it.
We now find ourselves in the middle of the war years - 1942 to be precise. Restrictions on cloth allowance seem not to have quite come in yet judging by the following outfits, although they would not be much longer in appearing. Even so basic simplicity appears ever more obvious, although fashionable flourishes still abound - as we shall see.
Top left wears: wine red wool two-piece suit comprising of a hip-length edge-to-edge jacket, fastened with loops and buttons in four sets of four from above the hemline to under the narrow stand collar and self-fabric buckled belt; two inset bands of bias-cut self-fabric from under arms to centre-front and full-length tight inset sleeves with padded shoulders; bias-cut knee-length flared skirt. Accessorised with a red silk turban, black leather envelope clutch bag and matching lace-up high-heel shoes. Red and black are such wonderfully contrasting colours (as anyone who has seen the film "Dick Tracy" could attest to; cf. some of Jessica's outfits over at Chronically Vintage as well), I could imagine this looking quite striking - especially if the two inset bands were black too perhaps?
Bottom right wears: Knee-length green and blue herringbone wool-tweed coat, single-breasted fastening from waist level to under wide lapels and large collar; flared from under arm to hem with long raglan sleeves, padded shoulders and hip-level welt pockets with top-stitched edges and raised & top-stitched seams. Complemented by a blue and green patterned silk scarf, navy blue felt hat with small crown & turned-down brim and navy blue leather shoes with round toes & high heels.
Top left wears: two-piece wool jumper suit comprising of a long single-breasted turquoise jacket with large hip-level patch-and-flap pockets, the upper bodice tucked from above the self-fabric tie belt to under the high yoke seam; shirt collar in fawn with matching lapel facings, yoke, full-length sleeves under padded shoulders and a knee-length box-pleated skirt. Finished off with brown leather shoes. Another clever use of colours - blue and brown is an often-overlooked combination, I find.
Bottom right wears: two-piece blue and grey striped wool suit comprised of a double-breasted unfitted jacket with wide lapels, patch pockets and stitched cuffs; wide trousers with turn-ups (I'm surprised to see turn-ups and skirt pleats so far in to the war because as far as I was aware both were prohibited/restricted - by the Utility Clothing Scheme I believe - from 1942 due to fabric rationing). White cotton collar-attached shirt with blue and silver-grey patterned silk tie. Black leather lace-up shoes. Quite a modern ensemble for our lone chap, blue and grey/silver being a popular combination even today.
Left wears: Cherry red wool dress with a semi-fitted bodice above a self-fabric belt with covered buckle, knee-length flared panelled skirt, black wool yoke with scalloped top-stitched edges continuing over the padded shoulders above long sleeves with scalloped pockets set vertically at hip level into panel seams. Topped off with black high-heeled shoes with turned-down tongues. Yet another excellent use of red and black - I bet this would look as good as the first outfit, not to mention more than suitable even among today's fashions.
There we have it then for another selection - and in my opinion one of the best yet. Some striking designs very much in the wartime style, I think you'll agree, but also I'd like to believe rather inspirational this time. Certainly there are if not entire outfits certainly aspects of them that could be incorporated into achievable looks today and which I'm sure I have or could easily see on several vintage blogging gals, if I may say so. I hope you agree with me - do let me know what you think!
The next two scheduled posts should more than redress the balance for us chaps, however. Despite no Miss Lemon fashion post from any of you ladies recently (what's the matter - suffering from bow cardigan fatigue?! ;p) another Captain Hastings-fest is on the horizon, as well as an extra-special addition to the Style Icon series. Hopefully I'll once again be able to take inspiration from both before long, in the meantime I hope everybody's continuing to keep well!
Oh Bruce, I haven't been able to do any further Poirot posts - a series of unfortunate events! DVD drive breaking on old laptop, realising set of Poirot I had borrowed was not in release order (very confusing), and going from working part time to full time have all scuppered my plans. I am saving up to buy complete Poirot boxset, and will resume fashion musings on Miss Lemon at some point after that!
Hope you are on the mend. One of the reasons I like old films is that the clothes etc are how it really was, not someone's interpretation of it.
As usual, an excellent post, from an excellent blogger. So sorry you are going through the wars old boy. I truly hope you are being well looked after. Take care x

One of the biggest risk a diabetic has (especially a Type 1 category) is to encounter a quick or unexpected drop in their glucose levels. This can lead to a very dangerous condition known as hypoglycemia.
Continuous glucose monitoring can help immensely and one popular product that performs this task is the Dexcom monitor. This monitor receives glucose data wirelessly from sensors and transmitters worn by the diabetic. The sensor has a very small needle that continuously monitors the blood sugar level and on-board transmitters send the data to a remote control that looks like a large pager.
This remote will then sound notifications via beeps and vibrations whenever it detects an out of bounds reading whose high and low points are set by the user.
The major problem with this unit is the notifications are very faint and do not occur for long periods of time. The notifications in fact are so quiet that people can easily sleep right through them! Plus there is a condition known as Hypoglycemia Unawareness where the diabetic's body doesn't even know that a dangerous condition exists and can also sleep right through the morning, where they wake up in cold sweats and dangerously out of balance.
This tutorial will describe a monitoring hardware device that will detect the Dexcom’s vibration notifications and provide an interface to your home automation system (via a contact closure) that can then notify family members or the individual that an alarm condition exists.
Several years ago I helped my friend build his custom home. We were able to run a lot of wiring throughout the home including several “future use” multi-pair low voltage wiring bundles. I also installed an Elk M1 Gold security/automation system along with all the usual speaker notifications throughout the home for voice announcements.
His daughter is a type one diabetic and uses a Dexcom remote monitoring system to continually keep track of her blood sugar levels. This Dexcom system includes a remote that will monitor sensors attached to her body and will provide alerts as described above.
One major problem is this remote will only provide a short ‘beep’ then vibrate during the detection of an alarm. This presented a problem during the night, when his daughter slept, as it would never be loud or long enough to wake her up. Also, he and his wife wanted to know if an alarm occurred during the night so they could insure their daughter’s condition would not worsen.
His wife researched several diabetes forums and websites in search of a product that could somehow ‘attach’ to this Dexcom remote and provide a more substantial notification of a detected alarm (such as a loud sound which would last for several seconds). To her dismay, no product seemed to exist.
One day, when I was making an upgrade to their Elk unit she asked if I could somehow interface this Dexcom remote to their automation system.

Day 1 with host Peter Wallace is the voice of the mainline churches. Through sermons, blogs, and video & audio resources, Day 1 proclaims a positive, passionate faith for today. Formerly "The Protestant Hour."
Day1 host Peter Wallace's new book on the emotions of Jesus is, according to Marcus Borg, “An illuminating and powerful personal meditation." Ideal for personal or group study.
David was a charismatic leader, a brilliant strategist, an ambitious politician, and a man of enormous personal energy. He alone united Israel's various tribes, North and South, into one nation. From his childhood when he showed up to do battle with a sling, he was able to assess danger, recognize opportunity, and face fear. Stories of his military escapades dazzle the imagination, and though they may have grown in the telling, no one doubts his prowess.
A few weeks ago, I received a video link from a friend. In the video, a young man performed a small-scale experiment, a "social experiment" if you will, on the streets of New York. As he sat on the sidewalk by himself, leaning up against a storefront window, the young man held a sign that read, "Homeless: need money for weed, drugs, and alcohol." As people walk by in the video, numerous people stopped to give him money. Some of the people who toss money into his cup say things like, "Stay high man, stay high," and "make sure you get a big bottle." After collecting a meaningful amount of money, his cup filled with cash, the screen goes dark.
In his anniversary series sermon, Dr. Tom Butts says Jesus wanted lines drawn to include, not exclude. But Jesus himself, and many of his followers through history, have suffered because of their championing of this attitude. But it's worth it.

We moved, said goodbye to the old rental house that had been home for nearly 8 years. But we didn't buy a place. The market has now long passed our affordability. So, we're stuck renting. The new place has twice the square footage, and Annabel has her own room finally. Still, what a mess this move has been. We have 30 boxes in the garage that need to be sorted through. We spent way too much at Ikea, though we finally have a real dining room table with actual leaves. I threw out 800 pounds of trash at the dump. How did we accumulate 800 pounds of trash, much less stuff?
Meanwhile, Susan's mother had a lung taken out. She has stage 3 lung cancer, even though she's a non-smoker. Her prognosis isn't great. All this happened while Susan's job went from terrible to awful. Luckily, she just got hired by a new organization and will be starting there later this month. She really wants to get down to Alabama as soon as she can, but with work it's a struggle. And with all the money flowing out into the move and the higher rent, she really can't take a week off without pay without seriously jeopardizing our finances.
Also, my camera got stolen. It was my fault -- I left it in plain view in my car, and the thieves smashed 'n' grabbed. Eventually, I'll get around to replacing it.
My work has been, well, Dunder-Mifflin-ian. Too much so. Only more drama than comedy. But there's finally someone to take over my admin roles. Now, I just have to train her. And I guess other parts of work have been OK, too. I'm starting to build a network in other parts of campus. There are some things blowing in the wind that suggest I might need to get close to some people on campus and hope that some of these possible changes happen. If they do and I position myself right, I will have something in the reins I've always wanted.
For small businesses, cloud computing hits a particular sweet spot. With cloud services, small businesses reap the benefits of not having to deploy physical infrastructure like file and e-mail servers, storage systems or shrink-wrapped software. Plus, the "anywhere, anytime" availability of these solutions, means hassle-free collaboration between business partners and employees by simply using a browser. In fact, it's not a stretch to say that aside from a locally installed desktop operating system and browser, a lot of today's small business technology needs can be fulfilled almost completely with cloud-based offerings.
Let's take a quick look at what constitutes a true cloud-computing solution. Cloud-computing services require no software to purchase and install. This doesn't include a Java plug-in or some other kind of lightweight applet required to use the service.
Cloud-computing fees for businesses are typically subscription-based. The vendors usually charge you on a month-to-month or annual basis. The solutions we feature here are relatively affordable and follow the subscription model.
Another feature of cloud computing is that it's easily scalable. Many of these solutions can work for a business with five employees or 5,000. Cloud-based service is nimble because it grows as your business grows.
For better or for worse, cloud-computing is the technology of the future. Just ask Microsoft's Steve Ballmer, who recently said that seventy percent of Microsoft employees are doing something at least related to cloud computing; in a year, that figure will be ninety percent. While some (such as PCMag's crankiest geek, John Dvorak) think Microsoft should abandon cloud computing, the rest of the industry is pushing forward. Although cloud computing is not without concerns about security, stability, and data ownership, at its best it allows businesses to unshackle day-to-day operations from the local datacenter. Cloud computing is helping to shape today's truly mobile workforce.
It is said that in the art of good storytelling, the success of a dramatic delivery relies not only on the candidness of one’s expressions, but also in the complementary elements of sound and music.
‘Rebab’ is a prominent musical instrument in the cultural history of Malay art and music. It is commonly used in classical entertainment like the Wayang Kulit, Bangsawan and of course, good, old storytelling.

New information regarding Capcom's 2013 Comic-Con panel has surfaced courtesy of the official SDCC schedule. Among topics intended to be discussed, “The World of Capcom Games" panel will reportedly bring Mega Man 25th anniversary information and a "few other surprises":
"Moderator Francis Mao (CAPCOM) leads a panel of CAPCOM's producers and product managers to share the latest details on all their upcoming games, such as Dead Rising 3, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney: Dual Destinies, Lost Planet 3, and DuckTales: Remastered, as well as information about Mega Man's 25th Anniversary, and a few other surprises! Plus, some lucky fans will be invited to play the CAPCOM 30th Anniversary Trivia Contest to win cool prizes!
At the very least we can expect to hear a little Smash Bros talk and maybe something Archie related. But given the fact we're seven months into the 25th anniversary, I like to believe it's about time we heard something about the future.
We'll just have to wait and see how things play out. For the time being, set your expectations appropriately.
last time capcom said they would announce for mega man at pax east and we all know what happened. my expectation for a game is 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000001%. if they did make a game for mega man, i might be happy since it's a game but i'll have to wait since they might cancel it like legends 3.
I mean, you'd like to see Hyper Megaman from MvsC, but honestly, it's probably the MM7 Super Adapter, or one of the MM6 Rush Adapters. I suppose it could be Flash Stopper; going around and shooting everyone frozen in time would be pretty wicked.
Time Stopper (Flash Stopper is the one that blinds you, from Bright Man) would be an interesting use of a Final Smash for sure. Another option may be one of his all screen attacks. I imagine Astro Crush or Lightning Bolt would the most visually appealing choices.
Seeing as they've already shown Mega's capable of using both hands as a Mega Buster I wouldn't be surprised if he could use the double buster. I think that would be a pretty awesome final smash for him to have.
I don't expect anything regarding MM. Archie Comics and Super Smash Bros, and probably merchandise, being the only things likely. Color me surprised if they do show something more than that, but I can't really expect it.
I do however look forward to hearing more Ace Attorney news. That franchise will still always be one of my favorites from Capcom.
I want say, i become pessimistic not only because capcom dont make any games for Megaman, but the fanbase seems to be bored and go AWAY.
I don't expect much from Capcom any more. All I want now is from them to release a physical copy of AA5
"to share the latest details on all their upcoming games, such as Dead Rising 3, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney: Dual Destinies, Lost Planet 3, and DuckTales: Remastered, as well as information about Mega Man's 25th Anniversary"
"upcoming games (MM not listed), as well as [MM25th] information (but not explicitly games)" <-- key phrase, indicating no Mega Man GAMES in the pipeline.
It's called suspense. They don't have to specify WHAT series these games pertain to. Look at past World of Capcom panel announcements before the panel happened. They never specify.
Protodude you always post news around a big conference and say will there be news of MM's future? Stop getting your hopes up, The future of MM... it's prolly gonna involve merchandise.
Did you even read the post? He didn't say anything about getting your hopes up. Just to have realistic expectations.
Mega Man-related news at Comic-Con? Maybe, but I'm not expecting it to be anything that's of any true significance, as far as a new game is concerned.
Am I the only one who actually wouldn't mind another collection release? Unlike a lot of people, I don't exactly own every MM game there is to date...
You can get all 3 collections fairly cheap on Amazon. There's no need for another collection. What we need is new games, not rereleases of old ones. not now.
So? Those collections are only a fraction of the franchise! We've got nothing for the ZX series, Battle Network, nor Starforce, plus the earlier two collections are missing X 7 and 8 as well as Command Mission and the Classic collection 9 and 10 as well as &Bass. Don't forget the GB Classic and X games, and Legends not capable of it due to problems.
NO. People like you are the reason the franchise is in the gutter, if they keep re-releasing the same games over and over the franchise will never expand beyond. The reason MM is in this gutter is because he only has hardcore fans, Capcom needs to make a MM that attracts even non MM fans, re-releases of series that bombed like Star Force and ZX are not what the series needs right now. Hell re-releases are not what is needed right now.
Hey 3:37PM anon. Name me five games still being printed and easy to find on store shelves other than the series that killed the franchise.
OH WAIT. THERE ARE NONE. And what do we have for fangames oh wait. All 8-bit except for few exceptions. The franchise has nothing to get hyped on for any front.
Even if we put out a single compilation on store shelves, it would greatly help people see Megaman and possibly become interested. Not all gamers are online(meaning they can't get VC nor 9 and 10), not all gamers go on websites that feature Megaman prominently. Right now we've got nothing outside of Smash Bros to get people interested. We need his face out there, even if we have to do a compilation.
Capcom My bad Crapcom said they did not want to upset fans by leaking games to fast without further analasis into any games they make so until the have a mega man gave that is final we are not hearing a peep from Crapcom for a while
Capcom's focus lately seems to be on legalized extortion. Namely, selling you a game with content that is locked, then making you pay extra money to unlock it. Either that or DLC that they try to sell you ON THE LAUNCH DATE! Seriously, why don't you just sell us the whole game like you used to. I wouldn't mind being able to buy additional content after the release, provided it adds to the game and wasn't simply locked or held back for profit's sake. That's like the difference between buying a car and having to pay a surcharge to use your trunk, or buying a car and putting an aftermarket stereo in a few months later.
Capcom is no longer run by storytellers and visionaries. It's run by profit-focused bankers. I get it, the purpose of a business is to make money. But come on now, if all you want is money, go be a friggen banker. Don't get into video games if you don't want to tell a great story to people who are eager to hear it. They snubbed Legends 3, and instead shat all over us with Megaman "Gotta Catch Em All" Battle Network, or another virtual console game. If we don't already own all of the old games, it's a piece of cake to find them in an already released compilation. And failing that, emulation sure isn't going away.
And then when Capcom finally does get off their rear and make something cool, like the Chronicles of Mystara on Steam, the damn thing doesn't even work half the time! Gah. It's enough to make me just give up on them altogether.
So I’m more of an illustrator/cartoonist but when faced with the opportunity to do a painting (especially for a good cause) you’d better believe I’m in.
This is a skateboard painted by me which will be up for auction on September 13th (that’s Friday the 13th for those of you taking note) at We Care Arts located at 3035 Wilmington Pike in Kettering, Ohio 45429. The proceeds will help facilitate We Care’s ongoing mission of providing a place for people with emotional, mental and/or physical disabilities to learn about,create and even sell their artwork.
Now even if you’re not in the Dayton area you can still take part in the art auction online. For all the details visit We Care’s facebook page here or their website here. And if you are from around here and aren’t familiar with the great work We Care does please take a moment to visit their site… I mean c’mon… if you’re reading this chances are you’ve got a few minutes to spare, right?
The good people at We Care Arts received four skateboards for the auction and in a moment of poor judgement gave me one of them and told me to paint it however I wanted. After a few minutes of careful thought I said, “Sea Beast!” because I love giant sea monsters… what can I say.
That decided I went to work on it and for your entertainment I’ve included step by step photos of the transformation of a brand new board into a one of a kind piece of art. You lucky devils, you!
Please consider stopping by We Care Arts on Fri. Sept. 13th for their all day art auction (1pm-9pm) and tell anyone who might be interested in skateboards (and tons of other sweet stuff)! Thanks!
After the creature got a second coat of paint it seemed like a good idea to rough in the sea (you can’t have a sea beast without a sea).
Next went in the clouds. I made them pretty and pink to contrast the horror that would soon be happening below.
More definition to his face (including pointy teeth with which to eat seamen… that’s seamen with an “a”).
And that’s how you paint a skateboard my friends! Be sure to visit We Care Arts on Fri. Sept. 13th to bid on this and tons of other art to support one of the best organizations in the community and the artists who benefit so much from its existence. I would greatly appreciate you spreading the word via all of your social media outlets (as well as good old fashioned word of mouth). Thanks!
Published by We Care Arts, this is an all ages friendly comic written by We Care Arts client Lauren Easley about a golden retriever who joins a bowling league. It’s pretty darn cute.
We Care is an art studio where people with physical, developmental or mental disabilities produce and sell artwork. I’ve been volunteering and working there for over two years and I can honestly say it’s the best thing I’ve ever been associated with. The difference this place makes in so many people’s lives is enormous.
You can purchase a copy of Striker for $3 by visiting the We Care Arts gift shop located at 3035 Wilmington Pike in Kettering, Oh (gift shop hours Mon-Fri 9am – 4pm and Sat 10am – 2pm). All proceeds are split between Lauren Easley and We Care Arts.
North Dakota&apos;s rapid personal income growth in 2012 was most impressive since it was the fifth time in the last six years that the state&apos;s ranking was the fastest in the nation. In fact, since 2006, personal income in the state has expanded at a compound annual rate of 9.2 percent, a substantial improvement compared to the 2.9 percent growth rate of all other states. In contrast, a number of states, including South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Iowa, all experienced below average total personal income growth in 2012 due to the deleterious effects of last year&apos;s drought on farm income. It should be noted that nonfarm personal income growth in each of these states was above average.
A review of the 15 states that belong to the Southern Office of The Council of State Governments, the Southern Legislative Conference (SLC), reveals several interesting trends. For instance, three of the 15 SLC states ranked in the top 10 in the nation in terms of personal income growth between 2011 and 2012. Specifically, Texas (4.8 percent) ranked 2nd, Oklahoma (4.2 percent) ranked 7th and Tennessee (3.9 percent) ranked 10th.
In terms of per capita personal income, while the United States figure was $42,693 in 2012, the SLC average was $37,678. Only Virginia ($47,082) had sufficient per capita income to rank in the top 10 among the nation&apos;s 50 states, coming in eighth.

French operator partners with Google to fund AI start-ups in the Middle East - Smart Cities World Forums
French telecommunications operator Orange has announced it has agreed to partner with US technology colossus Google, in an effort to explore opportunities to fund and potentially acquire start-ups in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
It has been further disclosed that Orange and Google are particularly interested in funding starts-ups in specific areas such as AI, Internet of Things, Cloud and Cybersecurity. CEO of Orange, Stephane Richard expressed his delight at the collaboration agreement it has entered with Google, and said emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things represent huge opportunities for entrepreneurs and enterprises.
The CEO said, "We are very proud to announce this partnership which will enable start-ups supported by Orange Digital Ventures to explore potential co-investment opportunities with Google. Through this partnership - we stand to reinforce Orange Digital Ventures' Smart Money value-proposition by offering entrepreneurs with whom we work much more than just financing.
EMEA President of Google Partnerships, Carlo d'Asaro Biondo said that Orange's ecosystem perfectly complements Google's nous and expertise in accelerating the growth of start-ups. He said, "This partnership is a way to enhance our collective contribution to innovation in this region.
Marc Rennard, CEO of Orange Digital Ventures, added, "From time to time, it's difficult to have a place at the table. When a start-up decides to call for investors - they might cover all their needs from others, without any possibility of us entering too. But with Google plus Orange, I think the company will think twice before rejecting us, so it may help us."
Tech Crunch also noted that with Google under scrutiny for alleged anticompetitive practices in Europe, investing in start-ups in the region is a way of showing it supports smaller businesses.

The medical services sector comprising hospitals, nursing homes, healthcare centres, dispensaries, pharmaceutical companies and other related establishments along with the concomitant healthcare professionals, has evolved almost radically in the last 50 years. Of all the segments categorized under the realm of medical sciences, the sector or section dealing with diagnosing diseases and prescribing treatment procedures have witnessed a tremendous progress, technologically speaking.
Most medical establishments and institutions both in the public and public sector nowadays maintain e-files or formats of patients’ medical histories. When a patient visits a physician for a check-up or a surgeon performs an operation, the medical report pertaining to the patient’s medical background is dictated by the specific medical professional that is stored in audio files. A medical transcriptionist or an MT transcribes the same data in an easy-to-read text format.
I’m sitting here planning my schedule for EclipseCon next week and looked up to see a wicked winter storm a-happening. California here I come…
Some of my illustrations for the book 12 HISTÓRIAS PARA A INÊS (não edições, 2017) were chosen to the exhibition 'Ilustração Portuguesa' (Portuguese Illustration), a broad showcase of best portuguese illustrators during Festa da Ilustração de Setúbal. This festival takes place in Setúbal, June 2017, with different shows and events; 'Ilustração Portuguesa' is curated by Jorge Silva, João Paulo Cotrim, José Teófilo Duarte and João Fazenda. Here's some pictures!
Good news! :) Out now the 2nd edition of NEVERLAND IS TOO FAR AWAY, poems by Virna Teixeira and my drawings,
Happy to be part of this illustration group show organized by the Municipality of Loures, starting on May 26 at Multiusos in Parque Adão Barata. The exhibition can be seen untill June 30.
PUTA DE FILOSOFIA is the second book from a set of fictions by Carlos Alberto Machado, published by Companhia das Ilhas. The challenge was to create cover art (illustration and graphic design) for these small-sized books, defining a common graphic expression for the different texts. I used black and white drawing (charcoal and indian ink) on watercolored background (a specific color range for each book) to match the dense and complex tone of the narrative. The back cover is simply black to match the drawing and to include a blurb or excerpt. Here's the result with this new title, out now. More to come this year!
New giclée prints have arrived! First ones from the illustrated book 12 HISTÓRIAS PARA A INÊS! (And they look amazing, thanks to the careful printing work by Francisco Vaz da Silva.)
The excitement and rage experienced at a cage fight reminds me a lot of the enthusiasm I hear coming from the supporters of Hillary and Barack in their contest for the Democratic nomination. The venom spewing from Hillary, countered by the honey flowing from Barack, has produced better TV viewing than we have seen in a long time. The only thing that could be better would be to see Barack respond in kind to Hillary.
The last Democratic debate brought tears to my eyes as I watched Hillary show her female side by grumbling about the favorable media coverage Barack has received. I guess Hillary now has a taste of how it must feel to be a Republican. God forbid she win the White House and have to endure the media treatment George Bush has been given. We would have to replace every lamp in the White House. Can you see her whining at a White House press conference like she did at the debate?
The unraveling of Hillary like a cheap suit while Barack continues to be one cool cat is sad to watch. Nothing much seems to affect Barack. When he showed up on the scene a year ago, the Los Angeles Times referred to him as the "magic negro." That has been changed to the "Teflon" Democrat. Nothing seems to stick to this guy. I remember the day, not long ago, I was having breakfast at the Mayflower Hotel when Barack strolled in with his entourage. You would have thought Muhammad Ali had just arrived. He made an entrance fit for a king ... or a president.
The Clinton war machine, with slimy Gen. Mark Penn in command, hit Barack with everything it had. The "kitchen sink" strategy. Barack is portrayed by the Clinton machine as a drug-dealing, plagiarist Muslim dressed in Somali garb who took his oath of office on a Quran and employs despicable tactics while campaigning for president. And while some of the claims were true, none had any effect on the rising star of Obama.
One minute the handlers are telling Hillary to talk about how honored she is to be on the same stage with Barack and in the next breath telling her to challenge his tactics. Call him out. Man up, Barack, against the manhood of Hillary. Cry a little; scream a little. Use everything you've got Hillary. What a joke.
Hillary is so hungry for power and so desperate to win this nomination, her ability to lie and distort knows no bounds. ICE agents do not leave infants on the couch after arresting illegal parents, Hillary. Our troops are succeeding in Iraq. Hillary never embraced NAFTA? She was secretly against the trade agreement her husband was so proud of? Right!
I only wish Hillary and her Democratic minions had as much of a desire for victory in Iraq as they do in winning the White House, but they don't. If Hillary needs to throw the troops, her party, her husband, her friends and the truth under the bus, she is willing to do so in order to return to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
This primary election has become a spectator sport with fans cheering their team on to victory without any regard for the damage that may be incurred as a result of the process or ultimate success. It appears just as long as their candidate wins; that is all that counts. It is sad when voters vote for people versus voting for the principles that guide those people.
So I suggest Barack maintain the high road he established early on in the process if he hopes to win. He need not lower himself to the politics of personal destruction the Clintons have perfected into an art form. He should continue to offer the cordial, dismissive smile to Hillary that has served him well.
He has no need to talk about Hillary's soiled past of the missing billing records or dubious campaign contributions from $10-an-hour Chinese dishwashers. Barack should ignore the Clinton pardons to terrorists of the FLN or fugitives at large like Marc Rich. Hey, come on. There are a lot of people who turn $1,000 into $100,000 in cattle futures.
Juan McCain would be well served to shut up and ignore the Obama/Clinton cat fight altogether. They will inflict more damage on each other than McCain ever could. At this stage of the game, McCain should save his best shots for when the campaign actually counts. McCain must realize it would require the suspension of disbelief to see a Clinton victory in this contest so he should save "the goods" for when Hillary leaves the stage kicking, fighting and ultimately crying in March.
This ultimate cage fight is rather entertaining and very educational as to just how mentally ill the Democratic Party has become. I wonder how long the screaming, seldom-seen chairman of the Democratic Party, Howard Dean, will allow this demolition derby to continue. One can only hope long enough for the party to destroy itself under the weight of the ego and pride coming from the Clinton camp. If the DNC wants a chance to use the drapes it measured for last summer, the fighting must stop soon.

Chibale, whose Drug Discovery and Development Centre (H3D) at the University of Cape Town (UCT) pioneers world-class drug discovery in Africa, has also become known for his pivotal work on malaria.
The National Research Foundation A-rated researcher shares the honour with leaders ranging from Bill and Melinda Gates to the presidents of France and South Korea – Emmanuel Macron and Moon Jae-in – as well as tennis player Serena Williams, Apple CEO Tim Cook and the Me Too movement.
Chibale said that his inclusion on the list was “totally unexpected and overwhelming. I am so grateful to God for this recognition on the global stage”.
Fortune magazine said its list looks at all sectors of society to find leaders “who are using their power and influence to make the world a better place”.
Chibale was selected for his pioneering work in developing infrastructure to support scientific research. The Zambian-born scientist founded H3D at UCT in 2010 and officially launched it in 2011. Having started out with a handful of researchers, he has grown H3D into a world-class centre, with more than 60 researchers in addition to approximately 30 postgraduate research students and postdoctoral fellows in his academic group. His team works out of state-of-the-art facilities at UCT thanks to various partnerships, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Medicines for Malaria Venture, Novartis and the South African government.
H3D works mainly in the fields of tuberculosis and malaria and already has a potential drug for malaria in human trials.
Chibale said he hoped that H3D would contribute to a global pipeline of new medicines for malaria and tuberculosis able to circumvent drug resistance. He added that he was inspired by confronting Afro-pessimism and debunking the myth that Africa could not be a source of health innovation.
“We need to demonstrate that Africa has more to offer than the mere opportunity for human clinical trials. Africa has largely been a recipient of Western research. It is time for Africa to also contribute research so that people from other continents can also benefit.
“The challenges we are trying to address in Africa are not just African challenges but human challenges. In this way Africa can earn respect.”
“Research is not a luxury. It provides solutions, creates jobs and infrastructure, builds capacity as well as expertise, attracts foreign direct investment, can seed an industry and contributes to reversing the brain drain.”
Chibale said he was particularly honoured to be included on the Fortune list with Bill and Melinda Gates, who have committed substantial resources to fighting the scourge of malaria, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases.
“Not only are Bill and Melinda immense contributors to the recognition I have received through the support of our H3D work from their foundation over many years, they are both tremendous inspirational and exemplary role models of leaders who serve others.
“Although I have no right to tell African billionaires and millionaires how they should use their money, I would like them to consider following the example set by Bill and Melinda by investing in scientific research in Africa.”
With World Malaria Day on April 25, Chibale said that it was imperative to work towards combating malaria.
“Africa is no longer just a place to conduct human malaria clinical trials. Africa is now also a place for malaria drug discovery and development. It is important to combat malaria, not just because of the unacceptably high numbers of deaths it is responsible for, especially among our children, but also because malaria continues to choke economic growth on the continent.”
Chibale’s life story is inspiring. He grew up in extreme poverty in villages and townships in Zambia. His home had no electricity or running water and he shared a single bed in a tiny room with his brother. But his perseverance and faith propelled him to reach his goals.
“It’s not how you start, but how you end up that matters,” said Chibale. “Adversity can allow you to discover gifts that you never knew existed.”

Physicalists commonly argue that conscious experiences are nothing more than states of the brain, and that conscious qualia are observer-independent, physical properties of the external world. Although this assumes the �mantle of science,� it routinely ignores the findings of science, for example in sensory physiology, perception, psychophysics, neuropsychology and comparative psychology. Consequently, although physicalism aims to naturalise consciousness, it gives an unnatural account of it. It is possible, however, to develop a natural, nonreductive, reflexive model of how consciousness relates to the brain and the physical world. This paper introduces such a model and how it construes the nature of conscious experience. Within this model the physical world as perceived (the phenomenal world) is viewed as part of conscious experience not apart from it. While in everyday life we treat this phenomenal world as if it is the "physical world", it is really just one biologically useful representation of what the world is like that may differ in many respects from the world described by physics. How the world as perceived relates to the world as described by physics can be investigated by normal science (e.g. through the study of sensory physiology, psychophysics and so on). This model of consciousness appears to be consistent with both third-person evidence of how the brain works and with first-person evidence of what it is like to have a given experience. According to the reflexive model, conscious experiences are really how they seem.
Defining consciousness. There are many differences of opinion about how to define consciousness. This uncertainty about how to define consciousness is partly brought about by the way global theories about consciousness (or even about the nature of the universe) have intruded into definitions. For example, "substance dualists" such as Plato, Descartes, and Eccles believe the universe to consist of two fundamental kinds of stuff, material stuff and the stuff of consciousness (a substance associated with soul or spirit). "Property dualists" such as Sperry and Libet take consciousness to be a special kind of property that is itself nonphysical, but which emerges from physical systems such as the brain once they attain a certain level of complexity. By contrast, "reductionists" such as Crick (1994) and Dennett (1991), believe consciousness to be nothing more than a state or function of the brain. Within cognitive psychology, there are many proposals which identify consciousness with some aspect of human information processing, for example with working memory, focal attention, a central executive, and so on.
Fortunately, definitions need not be final for research to get under way. It is enough that, for given investigative purposes, definitions are sufficiently similar for different investigators to be able to agree that they are investigating the same thing. As science begins to unravel the causes of consciousness, the functions of consciousness, how consciousness relates to nonconscious processing in the brain and so on, our understanding of what consciousness is will deepen - for the reason that such relationships form part of the meaning of the term (its connotative meaning, or sense). Such mutual focusing of attention followed by exploration of the nature of what is attended to (and how it relates to other things) is fundamental to how phenomena come to be understood in a socially shared way. In this respect, coming to understand the nature of consciousness is no different to coming to understand the nature of anything else.
Nevertheless, before any investigation can begin, one has to "point to" or "pick out" the phenomena to which the term refers and, by implication, what is excluded. In everyday life there are two contrasting situations which inform our understanding of the term "consciousness". We have knowledge of what it is like to be conscious (when we are awake) as opposed to not being conscious (when in dreamless sleep). We also understand what it is like to be conscious of something (when awake or dreaming) as opposed to not being conscious of that thing. This everyday understanding provides a simple place to start. A person, or other entity, is conscious if they experience something; conversely, if a person or entity experiences nothing they are not conscious. Elaborating slightly, we can say that when consciousness is present, phenomenal content is present. Conversely, when phenomenal content is absent, consciousness is absent. This stays very close to everyday usage and, for this paper, it is all that we need. To minimise confusion, I will also stay as close as possible to everyday, natural language usage for related terms. In common usage, the term "consciousness" is often synonymous with "awareness" or "conscious awareness." Consequently, I will use these terms interchangeably." The "contents of consciousness" encompass all that we are conscious of, aware of, or experience. These include not only experiences that we commonly associate with ourselves, such as thoughts, feelings, images, dreams, body sensations and so on, but also the experienced three-dimensional world (the phenomenal world) beyond the body surface.
Of course, to learn what something is, it is useful in the initial instance to know where it is, so that one can point to it - enabling the attention of different investigators to be focused upon it. But where does one point, when one is pointing at phenomenal consciousness?
Where dualists and reductionists think consciousness to be. According to Descartes the material world is composed of res extensa, a substance that has both location and extension in space. Consciousness is formed out of res cogitans a substance which thinks, but which has no location or extension in space. If this is right, then one cannot point at consciousness, as it has no location. At best, one might be able to point at the place where consciousness interfaces with the material world. According to Descartes this is at the pineal gland located in the centre of the brain. Physicalist and functionalist philosophers (e.g. Searle 1992; Dennett 1991) argue that consciousness is nothing more than a state or function of the brain. It might be difficult to point with any precision at such states or functions as they are likely to be distributed properties of large neuronal populations (cf Dennett & Kinsbourne 1992). Nevertheless, if one had to point one would point at the brain. In short, classical dualists and reductionists disagree vehemently about what conscious is, but they agree (roughly) about where it is. In so far as consciousness can be located at all, that location is somewhere in the brain.
A common-sense view of conscious phenomenology. In Velmans (1990, 2000) I have argued that this currently popular view has no basis either in science or in everyday experience. In order to decide where consciousness is (or whether it has any location) one has to attend to its actual phenomenology. It is true that there are some experiences which seem to be poorly localised in space, or at best localised somewhere in the head or brain, just as dualists and reductionists claim. Examples include thoughts and vague feelings such as the verbal thoughts, feelings of understanding and so on that accompany the reading of this text. However, most experiences have a very different phenomenology, for example experiences of the body or of the external world.
Let me illustrate with a very simple example. Suppose you stick a pin in your finger and experience a sharp pain. Within philosophy of mind pain is generally regarded as a paradigm case of a conscious, mental event. But where is the pain? Hampered by their theoretical presuppositions, dualists and reductionists take this to be a rather difficult question. However, if forced to point they would point (vaguely) in the direction of the brain (see comments by Nagel, Harnad, Searle, Marcel, and Dennett, following Velmans 1993). I take this to be a very simple question. The pain one experiences is in the finger. If one had to point at it one should point at where the pin went in. Any reader in doubt on this issue might like to try it.
Let me be clear that this sharp difference of opinion is about the experienced pain and not about the antecedent physical causes (the deformation and damage to the skin produced by the pin) or about the neural causes and correlates of pain. The proximal neural causes and correlates of pain are undoubtedly located in the brain. But the neural causes and correlates of a given experience are not themselves that experience. In science, causes and correlates are not ontological identities. I have given a detailed analysis of how causes and correlates relate to ontological identities in Velmans (1998, 2000), so I won�t labour the point here.
This subjective location of pains in parts of the body rather than "nowhere" or "in the brain" exemplifies a general principle that leads one away from both dualism and reductionism towards a "reflexive" model of how consciousness relates to the brain and the physical world (cf Velmans 1990). In many respects, there is no difference between these theoretical positions. For example, dualism, reductionism and the reflexive model agree that there are physical and neurophysiological causes and correlates of a given experience within the brain - and that we can leave it to science to discover what these are. But they disagree about the nature and location of the effects (the resulting experiences). Dualists claim that, being constructed out of res cogitans, experiences have no location or extension in space (although they interface with the brain). Reductionists claim that, being brain states or functions, all experiences must be in the brain (in spite of how they seem). According to the reflexive model, the only evidence about conscious phenomenology comes from first-person sources. Consequently, the properties of that phenomenology can only be determined from first-person sources. For conscious appearances, the appearance is the reality (Searle, 1992). Consequently, if a pain appears to be in the finger, then that is where the pain is. The damage produced by a pin in the finger, once it is processed by the brain, winds up as a phenomenal pain in the finger, located more or less where the pin went in. That is why the entire process is called "reflexive".
Notice that if one stabs one�s finger with a pin, and one attends to the consequent pain phenomenology, one has no additional, experience of pain either "nowhere" or in the brain. Nor can any phenomenal pain "nowhere" or in the brain be observed by an external observer (from a third-person perspective only its neural causes and correlates can be observed). Given that there is no first- or third-person evidence for phenomenal pain "nowhere" or in the brain, I suggest that this is a theoretical fiction, introduced by dualist and reductionist thinkers in order to make their models work. Only the reflexive model is consistent with the evidence of common sense.
To put the basic principle in a more general way: experiences are where we experience them to be. Figure 1, for example, illustrates a similar process with a phenomenal cat. As before, some entity or event innervates sense organs and initiates perceptual processing, although in this case the initiating entity is located beyond the body surface in the external world. As before, afferent neurons, and cortical projection areas are activated, along with association areas, long-term memory traces and so on, and neural representations of the initiating event are eventually formed within the brain - in this case, neural representations of a cat. But the entire causal sequence does not end there. The subject S also has a visual experience of a cat and, as before, we can ask what this experience is like. In this case, the proper question to ask is, "What do you see?" According to dualism, S has a visual experience of a cat "in her mind". According to reductionists there seems to be a phenomenal cat "in S�s mind" but this is really nothing more than a state of her brain. According to the reflexive model, while S is gazing at the cat, her only visual experience of the cat, is the cat she sees out in the world. If she is asked to point to this phenomenal cat (her "cat experience"), she should point not to her brain but to the cat as-perceived, out in space beyond the body surface. In this, S is no different from an external observer E. The cat as perceived by S is the same cat as perceived by E (albeit viewed from S's perspective rather than from E's perspective). That is, an entity in the world is reflexively experienced to be an entity in the world.
Of course, not all the entities and events we experience have such a clear location and extension in three-dimensional phenomenal space. We also have "inner" experiences such as verbal thoughts, images, feelings of knowing, experienced desires and so on. Such inner experiences really do seem to have a phenomenology of the kind that characterise Descartes� res cogitans. One might argue that verbal thoughts have a rough location, in that they seem to be "in the head" (in the form of inner speech) rather than in one�s foot, or free-floating out in space, but they are not clearly located in the manner of pains and cats. However, the reflexive process is the same. The cognitive processes which give rise to thoughts, feelings of knowing and so on originate in the mind/brain, although these processes are unlikely to have a precise location in so far as they engage the mass action of large, distributed, neuronal populations. Consequently, in so far as these processes are experienced, they are reflexively experienced to be roughly where they are (in the head or brain).
There is far more to be said about conscious phenomenology and its relation to the brain and physical world. But, if I am right so far, even a cursory examination of what we actually experience poses a fundamental challenge to dualist and reductionist presuppositions about what it is that they need to explain. Both dualism and reductionism assume experiences to be quite different from the perceived body and the perceived external world (perceived bodies and worlds are out-there in space, while experiences of bodies and worlds are "nowhere" or in the brain). But the reflexive model suggests that in terms of phenomenology there is no actual separation between the perceived body and experiences of the body or between the perceived external world and experiences of that world. It goes without saying that when one has a conscious thought, there isn�t some additional experience of a thought "in the mind". But neither is there a phenomenal pain "in the mind" (without location and extension) in addition to the pain one experiences in the finger if one stabs it with a pin. And there isn�t a phenomenal cat "in the mind" in addition to the cat one sees out in the world. Applying Occam�s razor, the reflexive model gets rid of them.
But the reflexive model does not get rid of conscious phenomenology. Thoughts, pains and phenomenal cats are experienced to have very different "qualia" (along with different locations and extensions), but they are nevertheless aspects of what we experience. Together, such inner experiences, bodily sensations, and external experienced entities and events comprise the contents of our consciousness - which are none other than our everyday phenomenal world.
Who else says this? To those immersed in dualist or reductionist modes of thought this proposed expansion of the contents of consciousness to include the entire phenomenal world may seem radical and the notion that many experiences have a precise location and extension might appear strange. But, thus far, this proposal is hardly new. In one or another form it appears in the work of George Berkeley, Immanuel Kant, C.H. Lewes, W.K. Clifford, Ernst Mach, Morton Prince, William James, A.N. Whitehead, Charles Sherrington, Bertrand Russell, R. Brain, Wolfgang Köhler and Karl Pribram. Similar analyses of what consciousness seems to be like have also recently been given by Antti Revonsuo and Michael Tye.
William James (1904) for example, suggests that to convince oneself about where experiences are the observer only needs to
"... begin with a perceptual experience, the 'presentation', so called, of a physical object, his actual field of vision, the room he sits in, with the book he is reading as its centre, and let him for the present treat this complex object in the commonsense way as being 'really' what it seems to be, namely, a collection of physical things cut out from an environing world of other physical things with which these physical things have actual or potential relations. Now at the same time it is just those self-same things which his mind, as we say, perceives, and the whole philosophy of perception from Democritus's time downwards has been just one long wrangle over the paradox that what is evidently one reality should be in two places at once, both in outer space and in a person's mind. 'Representative' theories of perception avoid the logical paradox, but on the other hand they violate the reader's sense of life which knows no intervening mental image but seems to see the room and the book immediately just as they physically exist".
One insight, of course, does not make a theory. While the philosophers and scientists mentioned above agree that some experiences appear to have location and spatial extension, there is widespread disagreement about what this implies about the nature of consciousness and its relation to the physical world. Berkeley for example is an idealist, James a neutral monist, Whitehead a process theorist, and Tye, a physicalist. In Velmans (2000), I develop reflexive monism, an analysis of what is going on which is none of these (although it incorporates elements of many positions).
It is only possible to introduce a few consequences of the reflexive model and how this translates into reflexive monism (a broad philosophical position) in a brief journal article. So, by way of introduction, I will focus here on just one fundamental issue: how it makes sense of conscious intentionality (that consciousness is consciousness of something). To set the theory in a philosophical context I will also contrast the analysis I develop with that of Armstrong (1968), Block (1997) and Tye (1995).
What do experiences represent? In dualism and reductionism it is easy to see what experiences of the external world represent. Percepts of objects "in the mind" or "in the brain" represent the objects we see out in the world. But, at first glance, the intentionality of conscious experiences would seem to be a problem for the reflexive model. If experiences of objects and objects as-perceived are phenomenologically identical, as argued above, then what do experiences of objects represent? One might ask the same question about the experienced body and about "inner" experiences.
And there is a related question. According to the reflexive model, what we commonly refer to as the "physical world" is just the world we experience. However, this clearly remains very different to the world described by modern physics (the world of quantum mechanics, relativity theory, grand unified theory and so on). So how does the phenomenal, "physical world" relate to the world described by physics?
A reflexive model of how consciousness relates to the brain and the physical world. The reflexive model shown in Figure 1 suggests that all experiences result from a reflexive interaction of an observer with an observed. For the purposes of illustrating how this interaction works to produce different kinds of experience, these can be subdivided into three categories:
(3) "inner" experiences (thoughts, images, feelings of knowing and so on) which have no clear location and extension in phenomenal space, although they can be loosely said to be "in the head or brain".
Figure 1 illustrates one example of a reflexive interaction resulting in an experience (a visual percept) of a phenomenal cat. In this case, the initiating stimulus (the observed) is an entity located in space beyond the body surface that interacts with the visual system of the observer to produce an experienced entity out in space beyond the body surface. As noted above, a similar reflexive interaction takes place when the initiating stimulus is on the surface of (or within) the body, or within the brain itself to produce experienced entities and events on the surface of (or within) the body, or in the head or brain itself.
What is going on? Following current conventions in the psychology of perception, I assume that the brain constructs a "representation" or "mental model" of what is happening, based on the input from the initiating stimulus, expectations, traces of prior, related stimuli stored in long-term memory, and so on (cf Rock, 1997). Such mental models encode information about the entities and events that they represent in formats determined by the sensory modality that they employ. Visual representations of a cat, for example, include encodings for shape, location and extension, movement, surface texture, colour, and so on. In addition, I suggest that the way information (in a given mental model) appears to be formatted depends on the observational arrangements. The information appears in different forms to the subject (S) and an external observer (E) for the reason that the means available to S and E for accessing the information in that mental model differ (cf Velmans, 1991).
An external observer, inspecting a subject�s brain, has to rely on his own exteroceptive systems (typically vision) aided by physical equipment (PET scans, fMRI and so on). Viewed in this way (from this third-person perspective) a visual mental model in the subject�s brain might appear in the form of neural activation in a series of relatively distinct feature maps distributed throughout the subject�s visual system. We do not know precisely what is required to make such neural representations conscious. However, given the integrated nature of visual experiences, it is reasonable to assume that when such distributed neural activities do become conscious they must be bound together in some way, perhaps through synchronous 40 Hz oscillations. We may also expect there to be observable (physical) influences on the pattern of activity embodied in the mental model from existing memory traces (corresponding to the effects of expectation, stored knowledge and so on). Whatever the fine detail turns out to be like, viewed from E�s perspective, the information (about the cat) in S�s mental model is likely to take a neural, or other physical form. In terms of what E can directly observe of S�s mental model, that is the end of the scientific story.
However, the observational arrangement by which the subject accesses the information in her own mental model is entirely different. As with E, the information in her own mental model is translated into something that she can observe or experience - but all she experiences is a phenomenal cat out in the world. While she focuses her attention on the cat she does not become conscious of having a "mental model of a cat" in the form of neural states. Nor does she have an experience of a cat "in her head or brain". Rather, she become conscious of what the neural states represent - an entity out in the external world. In short, the information encoded in S�s mental model (about the entity in the world) is identical whether viewed by S or by E, but the way the information appears to be formatted depends on the perspective from which it is viewed.
Let me illustrate with a simple analogy. Let us suppose that the information encoded in the subject�s brain is formed into a kind of neural "projection hologram." A projection hologram has the interesting property that the three-dimensional image it encodes is perceived to be out in space, in front of its two-dimensional surface, provided that it is viewed from an appropriate (frontal) perspective and it is illuminated by an appropriate (frontal) source of light. Viewed from any other perspective (from the side or from behind) the only information one can detect about the object is in the complex interference patterns encoded on the holographic plate. In analogous fashion, the information in the neural "projection hologram" is displayed as a visual, three-dimensional object out in space only when it is viewed from the appropriate, first-person perspective of the perceiving subject. And this happens only when the necessary and sufficient conditions for consciousness are satisfied (when there is "illumination by an appropriate source of light"). Viewed from any other, external perspective the information in S�s "hologram" appears to be nothing more than neural representations in the brain (interference patterns on the plate).
The "projection hologram" is, of course, only an analogy- but it is useful in that it shares some of the apparently puzzling features of conscious experiences. The information displayed in the three-dimensional holographic image is encoded in two-dimensional patterns on a plate, but there is no sense in which the three-dimensional image is itself "in the plate". Likewise, there is no sense in which the phenomenal cat observed by S is "in her head or brain." In fact, the 3-D holographic image does not even exist (as an image) without an appropriately placed observer and an appropriate source of light. Likewise, the existence of the phenomenal cat requires the participation of S, the experiencing agent, and all the conditions required for conscious experience (in her mind/brain) have to be satisfied. Finally, a given holographic image only exists for a given observer, and can only be said to be located and extended where that observer perceives it to be! S�s phenomenal cat is similarly private and subjective. If she perceives it to be out in phenomenal space beyond the body surface, then, from her perspective, it is out in phenomenal space beyond the body surface.
Perceptual projection. Unconscious mind/brain processes construct experienced realities in which our phenomenal heads appear to be enclosed within three-dimensional, phenomenal worlds, not the other way around. But the mental models that encode information about these 3D experienced realities are "in the head or brain". Given this, how do phenomenal cats and other phenomenal objects that are perceived to be located and extended in space get to be out there? It is clear that nothing physical is projected by the brain. There are for example no light rays projected through the eyes to illuminate the world, contrary to the beliefs of ancient Greek thinkers such as Empedocles (cf Zajonc, 1993). Rather, "perceptual projection" is a psychological effect produced by unconscious perceptual processing. The projection hologram has a number of features that might be usefully incorporated into a causal explanation of such effects, but it is not intended to be a literal theory of what is taking place in the mind/brain. Right now, we just don�t know how it is done. Of course, not fully understanding how it happens, does not alter the fact that it happens - and the experimental and clinical evidence for perceptual projection is considerable. I have reviewed this elsewhere (in Velmans, 1990, 2000) and will not repeat that review here. Clinical and experimental examples include phantom limbs, hallucinations and virtual realities. A particularly striking example is reported by the neurologist Peter Brugger (1994) in a clinical case history of a17 year-old man suffering from epilepsy caused by a lesion in his left temporal lobe. He was being treated with anti-convulsant drugs to control the condition and was scheduled for surgery when he experienced an "heautoscopic" episode (a visual hallucination of his body combined with an out-of-body experience) which was disturbing in the extreme:
"The heautoscopic episode, which is of special interest to the topic of this report, occurred shortly before admission. The patient stopped his phenytoin medication, drank several glasses of beer, stayed in bed the whole of the next day, and in the evening he was found mumbling and confused below an almost completely destroyed large bush just under the window of his room on the third floor. At the local hospital, thoracic and pelvic contusions were noted .... The patient gave the following account of the episode: on the respective morning he got up with a dizzy feeling. Turning around, he found himself still lying in bed. He became angry about "this guy who I knew was myself and who would not get up and thus risked being late for work". He tried to wake the body in bed first by shouting at it; then by trying to shake it and then repeatedly jumping on his alter ego in the bed. The lying body showed no reaction. Only then did the patient begin to be puzzled about his double existence and become more and more scared by the fact that he could no longer tell which of the two he really was. Several times his body awareness switched from the one standing upright to the one still lying in bed; when in the lying bed mode he felt quite awake but completely paralysed and scared by the figure of himself bending over and beating him. His only intention was to become one person again and, looking out of the window (from where he could still see his body lying in bed), he suddenly decided to jump out "in order to stop the intolerable feeling of being divided in two". At the same time, he hoped that "this really desperate action would frighten the one in bed and thus urge him to merge with me again". The next thing he remembers is waking up in pain in the hospital." (Brugger, 1994, pp 838-839).
In short, this patient mistakenly judged the hallucinated body on the bed to be his real one and tried to get rid of his real body (which he judged to be the hallucination) in order to become unified again - a powerful example of the constructed, projected nature of the body as-experienced. But we do not really need such striking examples to demonstrate that there is something interesting going on that needs explanation. The simple fact that this WORD appears to be out here on this page (rather than in your brain) illustrates that the phenomenon is both ubiquitous and real.
The world as-perceived is part-of the contents of consciousness. Some initial principles that follow from the analysis above should now be clear. Within the reflexive model the physical world as-perceived is part of the contents of consciousness. The contents of consciousness are not in some separate place or space "in the mind or brain". That is, in terms of phenomenology no clear separation exists between what we normally think of as the "physical world", the "phenomenal world", and the "world as-perceived". That said, the everyday physical world as-perceived does have to be distinguished from the more abstract world described by physics (and other sciences). According to the reflexive model, the physical world as-perceived is just one, biologically useful representation of the world that science might describe in many alternative ways. But, with our eyes open, what we normally call the "physical world" just is what we experience. There is no additional experience of the world "in the mind or brain".
How does the phenomenal, "physical world" relate to the world described by physics? In Velmans (2000, ch7) I give a detailed review of how the mind/brain system translates the energies described by physics into a world-as-experienced. I will not repeat that review here. Suffice it to say that the data from physics, sensory physiology, perception and psychophysics makes it clear that the perceived world "models" only a selection of the events and energies that physics describes. There are electromagnetic energies of many kinds that permeate space and even penetrate our bodies, to which our eyes (and other sense organs) are blind. There are signals produced by animals and insects to which our ears are deaf. Each sensory system has its own limits of resolution. Changes in light intensity of less than around 5%, or in sound intensity of less than around 20% are not perceived as changes. A change in sound frequency from 1000 Hz to 1005 Hz produces a just noticeable rise in pitch but not a change from 4000 Hz to 4005 Hz. A change in electromagnetic wavelength from 480 to 481 nanometers will produce a noticeable change in hue, but not a change from 550 to 551 nanometers. Our sense of smell and taste monitor, but tell us little of the chemistry of the substances we inhale and ingest. Sensation and perception are limited in their spatial resolution to detect events of a size and distance that are relevant to normal human action and survival � beyond this we need microscopes and telescopes. Our sensory systems are also structured to detect events of a given duration. Light bulbs, for example, actually flash 50 times per second (the frequency of the A.C. mains voltage). However, this "flicker frequency" is faster than the visual system can resolve which makes the light seem continuous. By contrast, the movement of a flower out of the earth is too slow to see, so one needs time-lapse photography to �see� the movement.
The data from comparative psychology, and zoology also suggests that the "physical reality" perceived by humans is only one of many possible perceived realities. The precise mix of sensory, perceptual, cognitive and social capacities in each species is unique. Human sensory and perceptual systems perform broadly similar functions to those of other animals. But the sensitivity of sense organs, the range of energies to which they are tuned, and the way information detected by the sensors is subject to perceptual processing vary considerably from species to species. Consequently, the "physical reality" that we perceive is actually a peculiarly human world.
Physicalist accounts of the location of qualia. As far as I can judge, the above account of how observer-dependent, perceived phenomena represent an independently existing "reality" which natural science might describe in other ways is consistent both with science and with common sense. However the observer-dependence of qualia such as colour, smell, taste and so on has been strongly resisted by some physicalist philosophers of mind. Their resistance is a consequence of their commitment to physicalism. If qualia such as "redness" are, in their essence, observer-dependent experiences, then it is not easy to reduce such qualia to "objective" states of the brain, no matter how brain states are construed. Armstrong (1968), for example, acknowledges that unless one can exclude properties such as "redness" from perception he would have to abandon his entire reductive programme, which claims perception to be nothing more than the capacity to make certain discriminations. But "redness" undeniably exists, so Armstrong is forced into the view that redness is an observer-independent, physical property of certain physical objects. (Having excluded such qualia from perception there is nowhere else for them to go!)
According to the reflexive model, colour appears only once light waves (in the visible waveband) have been translated by the visual system into colour experiences. That is, objects are only red if (a) they reflect light with the appropriate wavelengths (around 700 nm) and (b) the visual system translates that electromagnetic energy into a red colour experience. Of these two conditions, (b) is the more important. That is, the visual system can produce a colour experience without being innervated by light in the 700 nm region (for example in dreams, vivid imagery, and hallucinations). But, without visual systems of the appropriate kind, light waves of 700 nm have no colour at all (colour as such is not an electromagnetic property). By contrast, Armstrong claims that objects are "red" whether or not there is anyone to perceive them. As van der Heijden et.al (1997) note (in their commentary on a similar position adopted by Block, 1995), such a view simply does not take the natural sciences seriously.
"That there are colours in the external world is a naive idea, unsupported by physics, biology, or psychology. Ultimately, it presupposes that the representation (the perceived colour) is represented (as a perceived colour). A perceptual system performs its proper function when it distinguishes the relevant things in the outer world. For vision, the information about these relevant things is contained in the structure and composition of the light reflected by the outer world that enters the eyes. For distinguishing the relevant things in the external world, a unique and consistent representation of the corresponding distinctions in the light is all that is required." (Van der Heijden, et al, 1997, p158).
However, according to Block (1997), van der Heijden et.al are "wildly, unbelievably wrong. They say that we should give up the idea that a rose or anything else is ever red. The only redness, they say, is mental redness. But why not hold instead that roses are red .... rejecting colors in the mind? Why not construe talk of red in the mind as a misleading way of expressing the fact that P-conscious states represent the world as being red? And a representations of red need not itself be red (like the occurrences of the word "red" here)." (P165).
Block is, of course, right to point out that neural representations of red roses need not themselves be coloured. But no one claims that they are. What is claimed is that once a normal, human visual system is activated in an appropriate way, a visual experience of a red colour will result, irrespective of whether that colour corresponds to a physical property out in the world. Penfield & Rasmussen (1950), for example, demonstrated that direct microelectrode stimulation of the visual system resulted in visual experiences, stimulation of the temporal lobe in auditory experiences, stimulation of the somatosensory system in tactile experiences, and so on. Given that such visual, auditory, and tactile qualia can exist in the absence of the physical properties that they normally represent, it is not easy to see how they can be reduced to such physical properties.
A case for "red" and other qualia being observer-independent properties of the world rather than properties of experience has also recently been put by Tye (1995). Tye argues (as I do in Velmans, 1990) that all "qualia" are representational. He also agrees that qualia such as "redness" do not seem to be "in the mind or brain" but seem to be firmly attached to objects in the world. But he has an entirely different explanation of why the qualia seem to be out there. According to Tye, this results from perceptual experiences being transparent:
"Why is it that perceptual experiences are transparent? When you turn your gaze inward and try to focus your attention on intrinsic features of these experiences, why do you always seem to end up attending to what the experiences are of? Suppose you have a visual experience of a shiny, blood-soaked dagger. Whether, like Macbeth, you are hallucinating or whether you are seeing a real dagger, you experience redness and shininess as outside you, as covering the surface of a dagger. Now try to become aware of your experience itself, inside you, apart from its objects. Try to focus your attention on some intrinsic feature of the experience that distinguishes it from other experiences, something other than what it is an experience of. The task seems impossible: one�s awareness seems always to slip through the experience to the redness and shininess, as instantiated together externally. In turning one�s mind inward to attend to the experience, one seems to end up scrutinizing external features or properties." (p135).
To summarise, both physicalism and the reflexive model posit the existence of an observer-independent physical world, but they take a different view about how this relates to the phenomenal world (the perceived physical world). I treat the perceived "physical world" as part-of what we experience, and suggest that this experience is one, biologically useful representation of what is really there. These representations may or may not correspond well to the world described by physics. For example, the perceived distance of experienced events represents measured distance quite well for close events, but breaks down completely for large distances (e.g. the perceived distance of the sun gives little indication of its measured distance). Perceived location, and distance result from preconscious, mental modelling processes involving "perceptual projection."
According to Tye, however, inner representational states are "transparent." That is, we "see through" our representations of colour, smell and so on to colours and smells as they really are out in the world. Tye bases his case partly on how things appear to us, and partly on evidence that perceived qualia really do correspond quite well to properties measured by Physics.
As Tye notes, "Certainly we do not experience colors as perceiver-relative. When, for example, a ripe tomato looks red to me, I experience redness all over the facing surface of the tomato. Each perceptible part of the surface looks red to me. None of these parts, in looking red look to me to have a perceiver-relative property. I do not experience any part of the surface as producing a certain sort of response in me or anyone else. On the contrary, I surely experience redness as intrinsic to it, just as I experience the shape of the surface as intrinsic to it." (p145). Given that we experience such colours as not being perceiver-relative, he regards the view that they are perceiver-relative as "just not credible" (p145).
Given that physicalism routinely denies the reliability of appearances as a guide to what experiences are really like, Tye rests his case on shaky ground. There are many obvious counterexamples. The colours of surfaces may seem to be observer-independent, but the colours of after-images do not. If one stares at a red spot for a few minutes, for example, one will experience a green after-image that projects onto any surface that the eye fixates. The apparent size of the after-image also increases as the judged distance of the surface increases. So, if apparent, observer-dependence is to be the criterion of what is "mental", after-images are surely mental. The observer-dependence of colour attached to surfaces in the world also becomes evident once the visual system no longer functions in the normal way. In cases of red-green colour blindness, for example, red can no longer be distinguished from green � and in cases of achromatopsia the entire world appears in shades of grey! More fundamentally, the reason that surfaces just appear coloured (without any conscious contribution on our part) is due to the fact that visual processing operates preconsciously. That is, once visual scenes appear in conscious experience, the binding of colour with shape, movement and so on has already taken place! Finally, it is important to note that variations in how things are experienced cannot be used to decide whether or not things are experienced!
Tye�s second main argument relies on evidence that in some circumstances the qualia/physical property correspondence may be relatively invariant. Colours remain fairly similar for example when viewed outdoors, indoors (illuminated by incandescent lamps), or through sunglasses. Tye asks, "Why should this be? Surely the most straightforward answer is that the human visual system has, as one of its functions, to detect the real, objective colors of surfaces. Somehow, the visual system manages to ascertain what colors objects really have, even thought the only information immediately available to it concerns wavelengths." (p146) After a review of some of the relevant evidence, Tye concludes that
"Colors are objective, physical features of objects and surfaces. Our visual systems have evolved to detect a range of these features, but those to which we are particularly sensitive are indirectly dependent on facts about us. In particular there are three types of receptor in the retina, each of which responds to a particular waveband of light, and the spectral reflectances of surfaces at those wavebands (that is, their disposition to reflect a certain percentage of incident light within each of the three bands) together determine the colors we see. So the colors themselves may be identified with ordered triples of spectral reflectances. An account of the same general sort may be given for smells, tastes, sounds, and so on." (Tye, 1995, p150)
Tye is right to point out that the way perceived colour maps onto given patterns of light reflectance may be more invariant than is sometimes thought. After all, it makes evolutionary sense for our perceptual systems to pick out physical invariances when they occur and to translate these into relatively invariant experiences. However even a perfect correlation between perceived qualia and events described by physics would not establish their ontological identity (causation and correlation do not establish identity � see above). Indeed, physical descriptions as such do nothing to explain why one pattern of light reflectances should be perceived as "red," and another as "green," while a pattern of light reflectances in the ultra-violet region is seen as nothing at all (unless one happens to be a bee). Nor do physical descriptions explain the rather arbitrary way the visual system translates electromagnetic energies with wavelengths ordered on a ratio scale into colour categories ordered on a nominal scale. If our experiences simply "mirrored" the world, we would expect the relationships between properties described by physics to be more faithfully preserved in the way such relationships are experienced. To this one must add the many differences in the way given physical properties can be experienced both within and between species (see Velmans, 2000, ch 7 for a review). As van der Heijden et al (1997) note, the view that perceived qualia exist in the world in a way that is free of such biological influences simply does not take the natural sciences seriously.
Reductive physicalism rejects first-person evidence, arguing that conscious experiences are nothing more than states of the brain, however they might seem. Having reduced conscious states to brain states, they commonly try to externalise their "qualia", claiming these to be observer-independent, physical properties of the external world. Although reductive physicalism drapes itself in the �mantle of science,� it routinely ignores the findings of science. For example, it ignores the evidence for the highly specialised nature of human sense organs (sensory physiology), the constructive nature of perception, the complex relationship of experienced qualia to the energies described by physics (psychophysics), the ability of the brain to generate experiences in the absence of the physical energies that those experiences would normally represent (neuropsychology) and the many ways in which human perception differs from that of other animals (comparative psychology). In short, reductive physicalism ignores both the first-person phenomenological evidence regarding the nature of consciousness and the third-person evidence about how it relates to world described by physics. It is ironic that a philosophy of mind intended to naturalise consciousness gives such an unnatural account of it.
However, it is possible to develop a reflexive model of how consciousness relates to the brain and the physical world that is consistent with both third-person evidence of how the brain works and with first-person evidence of what it is like to have a given experience. Within this model the physical world as perceived (the phenomenal world) is viewed as part of conscious experience not apart from it. While in everyday life we treat this phenomenal world as if it is the "physical world", it is really just one biologically useful representation of what the world is like that may differ in many respects from the world described by physics. How the world as perceived relates to the world as described by physics can be investigated by normal science (e.g, through the study of sensory physiology, psychophysics and so on). While this is an entirely "natural" account of consciousness, it is nonreductive. That is, conscious experiences are really how they seem.

TÜRKİYE 1997 GENEL NÜFUS SAYIMI SONUÇLARI HAKKINDA DÜŞÜNCELER Aydoğan KÖKSAL* ABSTRACT Every year the population of Turkey has been increased. 1927 election of our population was 13.648.270, but in 1997
In this era it was an obligation to first work in the public sector before you can enter the university.
After that I moved in 1983 on the age of 16 years to the capital city of Kazakhstan, Almaaty. There I worked for one year as general worker.
One year later in 1987 I started the day education in the medical university faculty of general medicine.
Because the situation for foreigners in Kazakhstan/Semipalatinsk changed and also because a civil war started in Georgia I was forced to return home.
Because this the Ministry of Health permit me to do a shortened intensive education for gynaecology/obstetrician.
In the Netherlands I regularisate my diploma in Ministry of Health and got a Doctorandus title (in 2005)

The new issue of Flanzine is out now! I'm happy to participate, this time with a drawing (graphic pen and collage) for the page 51, between a text by Susana Moreira Marques and poems by Helder Moura Pereira.
O MAR DE LUDOVICO is the first book from a set of fictions by Carlos Alberto Machado, published by Companhia das Ilhas. The challenge was to create cover art (illustration and graphic design) for these small-sized books, defining a common graphic expression for the different texts. I used black and white drawing (charcoal and indian ink) on watercolored background (a specific color range for each book) to match the dense and complex tone of the narrative. The back cover is simply black to match the drawing and to include a blurb or excerpt. Here's the result with the first book, out now. More to come next year!
Happy to share some images of my latest contribution to the "Cão Celeste", literary magazine published by Inês Dias and Manuel de Freitas, with art direction by Luís Henriques. This time I worked in a drawing/collage from my series about (non) houses and here's the result! Front page: poem by Emanuel Jorge Botelho / Cover art: Maria João Worm.
Some of my illustrations for the book NEVERLAND IS TOO FAR AWAY (Carnaval Press, London) were chosen to the exhibition 'Ilustração Portuguesa' (Portuguese Illustration), a broad showcase of best portuguese illustrators during Festa da Ilustração de Setúbal (festival taking place in Setúbal, June 2016).

What about ancient legends and unexplained mysteries? What about ancient history? What about strange artifacts and advanced civilisations? What is a mystery? A pretty good question!

Our average response time is within one business day. Please note that we do not respond during Shabbat.
The Student Services Team (SST) is one of the important ways Beth Yeshurun ensures that all our students receive accurate and successful educational support.
Our Team consists of the Director of Student Services, our School Counselor, our Reading Specialist, our Director of Judaic Studies if needed, our Early Childhood Director as necessary, and our Assistant Head of School. Our specialists work closely to ensure students’ individualized needs are met.
Weekly meetings are held to discuss students who have been referred to our team, to determine those students who may be at risk academically, or those who have social and emotional needs. Students who demonstrate a need for more challenging work in academic areas are also discussed. We review student progress, study student reports presented by educational diagnosticians, and determine the appropriate actions that will be put into place. Additionally, we hold conferences with parents of these students to discuss our response plan to ensure that both home and school are on the same page for the best course of action to assist the child.
Our emphasis on student wellness stems from our belief that education should nurture and empower the whole person. With everything from educational seminars to dedicated divisional counselors to academic resource centers to serving healthy food, we make sure that all students are equipped with the coping skills and practical resources they need to thrive.
We don’t teach to the test: We use the data received from the test to help guide students to be better prepared as writers and readers. We do this authentically so as to not constrain their learning and application to one context or situation, especially not to an assessment. Elements of the ERB and other evaluations glean light on specific growth areas and it’s our job to help mold and challenge.
The mission of the BYDS Counseling Program is to support the school community by developing and integrating a comprehensive guidance program that will assist students in academic, career, and personal/social programs. This will allow children to develop a positive sense of self and become effective students, responsible citizens, and lifelong learners.
Most students face a number of stressors and challenges on any given day. Rather than ignore them (or pretend like they don’t matter), BYDS supports students in big and small ways as they navigate life’s twists and turns.
Our life skills activities include morning energizers, focused lunch, Mensch of the Month, and leadership opportunities. Our morning energizers incorporate a short and fun “brain break” to help start our day with a positive, ready-to-learn mindset. During our focused lunch, we play peaceful music in the background for the first five minutes as students quietly focus on eating and nourishing their minds. We have already seen great improvement in lunchroom behavior as well as better use of manners. Mensch of the Month will be incorporated with a new twist. Using the five life skills, one student per grade will be nominated by the grade level teachers for demonstrating the five traits throughout that month. Receiving this award is a huge honor, and these students will be recognized on Friday afternoon during Kabbalat Shabbat services.
The Comprehensive Testing Program (CTP) through the Educational Records Bureau (ERB) is a rigorous assessment for high achieving students in areas such as reading, listening, vocabulary, writing, and mathematics. Verbal and quantitative reasoning subtests are part of the CTP beginning in Grade 3. The CTP helps compare content specific, curriculum-based performance to the more conceptual knowledge base found in reasoning tests. It also compares student performance and growth with similar groups of achievers via national, independent, suburban public, international, association, district, class, and grade norms using scaled scores, stanines, and percentiles. Since the formation of our Student Support Team in 2015. Our students’ test scores have been on a consistent rise. Average BYDS scale scores on the 5th grade Comprehensive Testing Program (CTP) through ERB continue to surpass both suburban and independent school averages in all subcategories. Specifically, 5th-grade scores are 4.6 percent higher than independent norms in mathematics and 2.7 percent higher in reading comprehension.
We use the data received from the test to help guide students to be better prepared as writers and readers. We do this authentically so as to not constrain their learning and application to one context or situation, especially not to an assessment. Elements of the ERB and other evaluations glean light on specific growth areas and it’s our job to help mold and challenge our students thinking. Reading and writing are two of the most challenging lessons to teach – it involves processing and application – the way we have improved this is by analyzing the growth areas (i.e., what are their mistakes telling us), engaging them in the process, and creating more opportunities to apply their skills and IT WORKS!
Our school counselor, Alexandra Newman, is entering her 4th year as our school counselor. Before becoming our school counselor, she taught 2nd grade at BYDS for 3 years. Mrs. Newman holds a collection of degrees. Aside from her bachelor’s degree and her master’s degree in elementary education, she holds a second master’s degree in school counseling and will begin her LPC (licensed professional counselor) internship.
Mrs. Newman enjoys making meaningful connections with each student and instilling Jewish values in their daily lives. Knowing she is making an impact on all of these students is rewarding and fulfilling. What excites her about this role is being able to address all students’ needs. Mrs. Newman enjoys being able to build positive relationships with students and provide them with necessary skills to achieve academic success, personal/social development, and character building. In addition, she enjoys continuing to build relationships with parents.
Like several of our teachers, Mrs. Newman is an alumna of Beth Yeshurun Day School herself, representing a long tradition of lifetime BYDS involvement.
All children can be taught appropriate behaviors and can learn and grow to reach their full potential, if given the right environment.
The School Counselor is a resource and an advocate for all students, staff, parents and the community.
A School Guidance program should be comprehensive in scope, developmental in nature and preventative in design.
A School Guidance program should be intentional and include academic, career and personal/social components.
Classroom guidance is an integral part of the School Counseling program at BYDS. Classroom visits focus on topics dealing with personal/social, career, and academic matters. Lessons support the building-wide character education and encourage positive core values and traits including, but not limited to, fairness, responsibility, citizenship, trustworthiness, caring, and respectfulness.
During the school year, Mrs. Newman visits each classroom K – 5th biweekly. During these lessons, classes discuss various character traits or teacher-requested topics. Classroom visits are 30 minutes long and full of fun!!
A parent/guardian may request a conference with the counselor to discuss their student’s personal needs or concerns. In fact, parents are strongly encouraged to contact the counselor as any assistance is greatly appreciated in helping your student achieve their personal potential.
Throughout the year, BYDS hosts parent workshops that pertain to trending topics. Some of the topics addressed have been executive functioning, cyber safety, parenting resilient girls, and many more.
BYDS is a No Place for Hate School. No Place for Hate helps to create and sustain inclusive school environments where all students feel valued and have the opportunity to succeed by promoting respect for individual difference while challenging bigotry and prejudice. The No Place for Hate® initiative provides educators and students with the resources to ensure that anti-bias and diversity education are an integral part of the school curriculum. Our No Place for Hate program at BYDS has evolved to a student driven leadership program. Students from 4th & 5th grade are selected to be on a NPFH student coalition. Students can choose to participate in this group and meet monthly with Mrs. Newman. These students help organize school-wide activities that are required to help make us a No Place for Hate school. Some of these activities include: mix it up lunch, our school-wide Kindness Tree, volunteering at JFS Celebration Company, and much more.

The level of the students in reading competence is fair (33,3%)
Paul Dirac is recognized by most authorities as one of the greatest theoretical physicists of the twentieth century and father of the field of quantum mechanics. He was the youngest person ever to win the Nobel Prize when he shared the 1933 prize for discoveries in atomic theory with Erwin Schroedinger. The Paul A.M. Dirac Collection consists of selected materials that were digitized from the original Dirac Papers. The digital collection contains lectures, documents including Dirac's PhD dissertation, photos, formulas, awards given to Dirac, and other historical objects.

Trusted Communications with Physical Layer Security for 5G and Beyond — Recommend this title to your library
The fifth generation (5G) of cellular systems addresses challenging objectives in terms of connection speed, latency, energy consumption, traffic type, number of served users and their type (not just humans but mostly devices or even herds of animals). In this plethora of requests, a proper design of the waveforms is seen by many in the field as a key factor for the success of the new standard. This chapter will look at the possible waveform candidates from a physical layer security (PLS) point of view, providing an overview of on-going research activity on how they can be exploited to either secretly transmit a message on a wireless channel or extract a secret key between a couple of users.

One element of our due diligence is to publish those works that have been removed from our collection with the relevant details.

Soon, if you need a ride to the airport or just around town, you’ll have another decision to make. Do you hop in a cab? Request an Uber? Or perhaps….you take a self-driving taxi.
What just a few years ago seemed like futuristic technology right out of a sci-fi movie will be here before you know it.
Last week, the company revealed that it will start offering commercial self-driving taxis and delivery services in Washington, D.C. and other yet to be named cities by as early as 2021 – a mere 3 years away. Testing is slated to begin next year.

"In 1849, hungry gold miners crossing the Nevada desert noticed some glistening balls of a candy-like substance on a cliff, licked or ate the balls, and discovered them to be sweet-tasting, but then they developed nausea. Eventually it was realized that the balls were hardened deposits made by small rodents, called packrats, that protect themselves by building nests of sticks, plant fragments, and mammal dung gathered in the vicinity, plus food remains, discarded bones, and their own feces. Not being toilet-trained, the rats urinate in their nests, and sugar and other substances crystallize from their urine as it dries out, cementing the midden to a brick-like consistency. In effect, the hungry gold miners were eating dried rat urine laced with rat feces and rat garbage."
Partnering with civil engineering design firms, D & D Engineering keeps in mind that the end product of this design has far reaching environmental as well as "neighborhood" impact. Wastewater collection as well as treatment has continued to be a major focus for the growing populace. Designing electrical systems that keep the innovative treatment system processes operational and in continuous operation is the focus for D & D engineers. Being mindful that the aesthetics of the neighborhood, from a visual as well as an audible standpoint frequently requires innovative designs for not only the wastewater system, but for the standby power systems that are mandated for these installations.
Minimizing disruption to the environment and the neighborhood are the primary design goals of D & D Engineering.

We got our engagment photos taken last Saturday. Sharon, took the pictures and they turned out great. We found out about the Provo-photographers' secret spot for engagement shots. It's behind the mental hospital on center street.
If you drive in past it there is a hill and there is a little castle type thing there with an ampitheatre. Everyone who takes engagement photos around here has the rocks in the background. We tried to avoid them, but after taking about 50 pictures, the one with the rocks turned out the best! Oh well.
I took the digital picture (added a white border and touched it up, of course) to wal-mart and they had 375 pictures printed out in under 30 minutes for me! INCREDIBLE. Now I guess I'm going to spend the next day or two stuffing invitations and cards and licking envelopes. I hope I got the non-toxic kind.
I think that you can tell how much money somebody has by looking at their shoelaces. If they don't even HAVE shoelaces, you know they're in trouble. That was a blanket statement, which included all sandal-wear. I have never seen a rich guy walking around in flipflops.
If you will take a second to observe my shoe in this picture, you will readily see that I have hit rock-bottom and am completely out of money. I just bought a diamond and a new car for Rachie. And now we're looking at buying a house rather than renting. I think my shoelace tells the rest of the story very well.
Sometimes, life is like a shoelace. But isn't it supposed to be like this when you first get married? Isn't this part of the American dream? If not, please don't tell me.
Rachel and I got engaged Monday night. She knew it was coming - I mean, we were practically planning our wedding already - but I was still able to surprise her. So much that she did a double-take when she saw the ring.
We are getting married on 23 August 2003 at 9:30am at the Provo Temple. We both love the Provo temple very much. We've been there together so it holds sentimental value to us. Rachel grew up next to it, also. She only lives a few blocks behind it. It is also my "favorite" temple because it is the one that I've gone to the most. I've had countless special and sacred experiences there. When we talked about places to get married, Provo stuck out in both of our minds. We also both agree that the recent exterior changes they have done to the temple are good. The new white spire with a Moroni is excellent.
We chose August 23 because, quite frankly, it's the only time that works - not because it is my birthday, but you got to admit, that is kind of cool. I will never forget my wedding anniversary for the rest of my life. And even if I do, it's okay because she can't get mad at me because it's my birthday! haha. If we did it any later people would be in school and it would be hard for people to travel. If we did it any earlier that would just be insanely fast and wouldn't be enough time to plan things.
We will most likely be having our reception that night at 7pm at the Art Museum on BYU Campus. More details to come on that. My bride-to-be (B2B - I don't like the word fiancee very much - it's French) is taking care of getting that place scheduled for sure today or tomorrow. As of yesterday, when they closed, it was still available. So I think we will be able to get it.
I think we found a place to stay over close to our friends Larry and Krista. There is a small townhouse community over there and we looked at a few yesterday and found one that we love. I just figure it'd be better to buy a home and live frugally for a month or two than to throw money down the drain renting for a year or two. Rachel loves the place and is very excited. More to come on that, later.
Wedding planning is a lot of work. I will most likely be very busy for the next few weeks. Any recommendations on photographers, reception ideas, honeymoons, etc are more than welcome...
Jason is going on a huge, week-long backpacking trip this week, so I took him to the airport very early this morning. I don't think I've gotten up that early since I was a kid. I've felt like I am going to puke all day long.
As I was pulling off of the freeway and entering into airport property there was a white SUV pulled over to the side of the road. I was following three cars and going the same speed as all of them so I thought nothing of it. Jason said it was a cop, and I was like "no way."
After about 15 seconds I saw the lights in my rear-view mirror. Oh crap. He pulled us over and asked for license and registration. He informed me that I was doing 63 in a 55. I told him I was just going with the flow. I hear that you're never supposed to say that to a cop, but for some reason when you are put on the spot it just comes out. I couldn't help it.
He ran my plates and was checking the VIN number of my car. Apparently, there was more to this stoppage than a speeding violation. But what was the problem? After a few minutes he came back and thanked me for the time. He kept saying "man" over and over. I think that when he saw that I was young it helped him to relax and he started talking like a surfer. "Here's your license, man. Thanks for you time, man. Sorry, man. There was a car stolen just like this one earlier, man."
So that was it. They thought that I had a stolen car - lucky for me. The whole time I was just upset because my insurance rates drop when I turn 25 (in one month) and I didn't want another ticket to ruin my rates! I've been pulled over three times in the last two years. I was speeding all three times but only got a ticket once. On that one instance, I was going really fast on the freeway and really deserved it. The other two times they thought that I had assaulted someone and had stolen my vehicle. There must be a lot of kids out there driving red Hondas and Acuras that commit crime.
Anyway, thank you Salt Lake City Airport Police for not giving me a ticket! I'll never speed in your airport again!!!
Panda Express is huge. They have anywhere from 20-50 franchises per state according to their website. You think that they would have a top-notch production facility. But if you get their chopsticks and look at the wrapping it says:
"Welcome to Chinese Restaurant. Enjoy your nice Chinese food. Experience the historical and cultual of Chinese food."
You'd think that they would have somebody who speaks English read over the label before they make like 10 million of these things. I'm not complaining about the chopsticks that the industry provides, they are good. I'm just thinking that maybe these restaurants might want to hire a content writer/editor for their products so they don't replicate a small error a million times over.
I've been traveling a lot recently. Well, a lot for me, anyway. Considering that I think the first time I flew on a plane was when I went to Provo, UT to go on my mission and then flew to Brazil. I may have flown before that when I was younger, but I don't remember it at all if I did.
A few months ago I was on a JetBlue aircraft on the way back from Long Beach, CA where Rachel and I had gone down to visit Jason for a 5-day weekend. I recall looking around at the signs inside the plane before take off, since they make you sit there for like an hour before the plane even moves.
I noticed that the back-left bin in the aircraft was used for the flight attendants, so they didn't want anyone else to use it. There was a small sign on that particualar bin that said "NO STOWAGE." I said it aloud because it sounded strange to me. No stowage? Don't they mean "no stoRage?"
Stowage isn't a word, is it? I laughed to myself because I thought that JetBlue had made a mistake and all of their planes said stowage on them. Not until I got home and looked up the word did I realize that I was the one that was stupid.
The word "stow" means to place or arrange, especially in a neat, compact way: stowed his gear in the footlocker or to fill (a place or container) by packing tightly. And the word "stowage" means the act, manner, or process of stowing or the state of being stored. I suppose that the word stow is appropriate when it comes to airplane bins because you really have to pack stuff tight. They NEVER have enough room for everyone's stuff.
I guess the joke's on me. But I still say that the word stowage sounds really funny - Elmer Fudd'ish.
I think that we've all gone nuts with the cell phones. I see people walking around with these things everywhere. A common cell phone etiquette problem is leaving it behind in a public place when you step away for a minute. This happens quite often here at Banta in the corporate offices.
Usually someone will step out for a second to use the bathroom or get some lunch, and they will leave their cell phone sitting on their desk. The problem is, if it starts to go off then what is everyone supposed to do? You can't answer someone else's cell phone, that just seems wrong. It feels like you're reading their mail or something. Either way, it has the appearance of an invasion of privacy.
But, at the same time, you don't want to just let the phone sit there and ring. Cell phones tend to have the most annoying rings imaginable. They are loud and penetrating ... just awful. So the phone starts going off in the middle of the office and everyone just sits there looking at each other all awkward-like, not knowing what to do.
Another common problem I've noticed is DWC. It's kind of like DUI, but it's Driving-With-Cellular. On the way to and from work I see cars swerving back and forth like they are drunk. I see cars slamming on brakes, accidents, upset people ... when I get a closer look I see that the driver has a cell phone and it explains everything.
I've noticed that there are some things in this life that are just too hard for men to remember. For example, birthdates of family members, anniversaries, planned events, etc. Okay, pretty much men forget everything and completely rely on wives or palm pilots to get them through this clouded, busy life.
There is one thing, however, that all men from the age of 18 to 28 know and will never forget. It is the Konami Code. Years ago there was a Nintendo game called Contra, made by a Japanese company called Konami, that was very popular. For it's time, it was very hard and it only started you out with three lives. For your average kid, there was no way to beat it ... until Konami released their legendary code.
This code would give the user 30 lives, which was plenty to get through Contra. It turns out that this code also works on a few other Konami games. I'm still not sure why every man knows this code, but can't remember other important things in their lives. I guess that just goes to show how important video games were to kids in the 90s as I mentioned in my last blog.
The phone is the source of one of my biggest pet peeves. I hate it when you're at the store and the person there has to take a phone call - so they stop helping you and start attending the person that called.
It's amazing that they do this. That person is sitting at home in their underwear, too lazy to leave their home, and they get first-rate service! Meanwhile, I went out of my way to get ready, come all the way to the store in person, and they won't pay attention to me until they are done with their phone call. It's really screwed up. If someone comes to the store IN PERSON they should get first service regardless.
What kid doesn't try to sneak a peak at the Christmas presents that their parents have hidden in the top of their closet? I think everyone has done it at least once or twice.
Except for maybe Karl Maeser. He is famous for his BYU Honor Code quote, but the fact is that BYU doesn't quote the whole thing usually. "Stand me on the floor and draw a chalk line around me and have me give my word of honor never to cross it. Can I get out of the circle? No. Never! I'd die before I looked at the presents my parents got me for Christmas!"
I don't recall any specific examples of doing this myself except for one time. My brothers and I were really into Nintendo at the time. I was the first kid on the block to beat Super Mario Bros. I was literally a hero to my friends. The first time I beat it was actually making up for a lie. I was over at David Nutter's house and everyone was there. David, Cory, Luke, Dan, the whole gang. We were on the last level and David said that the final Bowser was impossible to beat. I said, "No he's not, I already beat him." Which was a total lie and to this day I'm not sure why I said it. So everyone was like "NO WAY!" and they wanted me to show them how to beat him. That's when I started to get nervous. My reputation was on the line. Luckily, I made it all the way through the last castle and I approached the bridge where Bowser throws those little axes/hammers at you. The obstracles fell just right and I ran right under him and got to the end. Everyone sat in awe for a moment, looking at what just happened. Then, simultaneously, everyone leaped up and everyone began to jump up and down, giving high-fives, and screaming and yelling for joy. James has done it! He's the BEST Nintendo player ever! He saved the PRINCESS!!!!
The next year I wanted to get Kid Icarus, Tecmo Bowl, and The Legend of Zelda for Christmas. We made it very clear to my mom which games we wanted. (One of the advantages of having two brothers is that you get three new Nintendo games for Christmas) Sometime in November my parents were gone and I couldn't stand the anxiety any more. I HAD to know if I was getting all of these games.
I got a chair and found the Kaybee Hobby bag and looked inside. "Omigosh! The Legend of Zelda! Kid Icarus!" I was overwhelmed with joy. How could I possibly wait for another month? I looked at the third game, excited to see Tecmo Bowl. When I used the Chicago Bears, nobody could beat me. I was unstoppable. To much dismay, and the crushing of dreams of a little boy, I saw "10-Yard Fight." My mom must have somehow mixed up the football games or thought that they were all the same anyway.
I don't really remember what happened after that, but I do remember that when my parents got home I was crying harder than I think I've ever cried in my life. I kept saying, "We don't want 10-Yard Fight! We don't want 10-Yard Fight!"
Parents obviously don't realize how important Nintendo is to their children. Their entire happiness and self-esteem is based upon their success in video games.
A few years ago I was up in SLC at the Eagle Gate Plaza talking with my stock broker, Shree Sharma, at RBC Dain Rauscher (highly recommended, he's great). I was discussing the issue of high-risk vs. low-risk investments. Normally, a married man with children and such will want to create an 80-20 portfolio. 80 percent low-risk and 20 percent high risk. I inquired if this was the right thing for me to do. At the time I was 23 and single, had a healthy income from my new job at Banta Publishing and had no prospects of getting married - which is kind of mean to say, because I had a girlfriend at the time ... but that's a whole different story.
I was rather shocked to hear that he recommended against such a secure portfolio. He and I both ended up agreeing that I was in the stage of my life that I was perfectly able to take losses and so it was fine to make almost 100 percent high-risk investments. Long story short, in the last year I've made some big investments that turn my stomach at night.
First lesson learned - don't open a business unless it has the promise of making you millions. If the expected revenue from your new business will only equal about what a normal salary would be - assuming everything works out okay - that pretty much means that you will work about 12 hours a day and won't make enough money to even stay open. You'll lose your initial investment and a year of your life will go down the drain. I'm talking about The Hive, in case you didn't notice.
Second lesson learned - give up a bit of ownership of your company for instant cash that equates to peace of mind. (I think it's really funny when people typo "piece" of mind) Right now, if erentpayer fails then I will be out tens of thousands of dollars. I'm not sure what I would do. My life situation right now is such that I need a few thousand on hand at all times in order to cover mortgage payments and "female costs" - haha. I'm sure that I'll be fine and everything will work out in the end, but it is just scary to think that if our sale dept doesn't make any sales soon or if things dont' work out then I will lose big.
Seems to me like if you were going to invest $10,000 into a startup company, then it would be just as safe to go to Vegas for the weekend and put $10,000 down on one hand of black jack on a high-roller table. You'd either double it or lose it all - either way, you wouldn't have wasted a year of your life trying to make that $10,000 grow.
This last week has been huge. Many things have happened. eRentPayer made it's first month of payments go through, and it was so successful and profitable that we bought a new office in Las Vegas (see attached picture). It's a great facility. Very new, very modern, very comfortable. It should help us gain respect and attract skilled employees.
The Hive is all but out of business. My other partners like the idea of staying open until the end of August. However, that would only make enough money to pay for maybe one more PC. So, if you think about it, it doesn't really make sense. Staying open one more month means that between the four of us, we need to work 264 hours to make a few hundred dollars. We'd essentially be making about $2-3 per hour. Now that is impressive. I'm all for closing the thing up before we need to pay lease next - July 14. Which means that, if they agree, we may be moving out and liquidating this weekend. It is somewhat of a drastic thing to do, but all of the owners agree that The Hive uses up so much of our time and doesn't make enough money to make it worth it - it's for the best to move on with our lives.
Another drama involves an old salesman, Kyle, that tried to sell some software for me last year called SmartFBO. SmartFBO is sold to private hangers at airports to help schedule their aircraft and keep their pilots' records. At the time, our relationship with Kyle looked good. It seemed as though he would be able to do his job effectively and that we'd be around him long-term. However, after about a month or two he had no success and gave up. The bad part about this is that I helped Kyle purchase a laptop that he supposedly needed to do demos with the owners. So now, the bills are starting to pile up at my door and where is Kyle?
He was introduced to us by a mutual friend, Mark. I called Mark to get Kyle's info and he was very shady about the whole thing. He now refuses to give me Kyle's info and whenever I need to talk to Kyle, Mark calls and then relates the message back to me. I have acquired Kyle's phone number, but he never answers it anymore because he's afraid it might be me. I did talk with him last Thursday and he said that he'd give me some money that day, but then he stopped answering his phone for the next few hours and then he just turned it off - so it went straight to voice mail. I have promises from both Kyle and Mark that this whole deal will be settled today. Either Kyle will pay for the laptop in full (he now owes about $2700 due to late fees piling up) or he'll just give the laptop to me and we'll let Jason use it for eRentPayer. I hope he is willing to comply and doesn't run again!

I need to buy several Polaroid cameras. I don't want to shell out a lot of money on the camera or film since I need to buy between 5 and 15, but want to have cool, vintagy-type photos. What would you recommend?
Currently the peel apart pack film is the most economical and gives the vintage look prints. There are quite a few choices in packfilm cameras from Auto 100 to Colorpacks and can be found quite reasonable. I will PM you.
Would also like to clarify I am only 12 min through the episode and maybe she redeems herself by the end but she just tried to build a table without screws proving she is not as smart as she thinks she is and her entitlement involving her skill and smarts is really what angers me the most Barrys been doing this shit for 5 years you 6 months barely so don't act like you know all is all im saying about here character and thats not about guidance as much as a snotty teenager who needs to learn she doesnt know everything
Ok your right i guess i need to rephrase her character is good she does however as you said need some sort of something from Barry and Iris like a grounding featuring those meta dampening wrist cuffs or something because she clearly needs some talking to all she says is oh you dont like what I do and all she has done since she got here powers which she said was six months before she fucked the timeline is fuck it worse mom why would you put a collar on my powers well dumb nora who claims her future is so sophisticated should see she is prob causing that exact thing by not listening to anything its not like she hasn't received guidance SHE WILL NOT LISTEN that is what is annoying all she has done is mope about how she screwed things but then she still does it contrary to what people say every step of the way love the actress she portrays character for what she is well but Noras character for as smart as she claims she is does all the dumbest things @A3R (btw i think ralph is hilarious)
On the contrary I like Nora. She is a fun character full of energy that just needs guidance from her parents. If I were to pick one character I dislike the most, it would be either Iris or Ralph. Even then though, they aren't that bad.
A lot of the links chop off the last 5-6 minutes of the episode, I used link #13 by disidi to get the full episode.
Also based on the basic tenets of what make a democrat and republican (again not that your restrained to necessarily having all beliefs of one party completely) Lex Luthor would obviously be neither he would be a dictator but clearly leaning more to republican ideals like tradition and do some basic reading on the differences between the two and what lex luthor says and acts like in the comics or movies and you would see that. however to finish I will say that just because he believes in republican ideals does not blanket the republicans with a shade of evil. One man does not make all of them and the same can be said about any character bad or good in this show they have different beliefs there individuals. Oh I am also gonna point out why does the race of these characters matter. Black women bad or good, white guy bad or good, that shit changes, Lenas mom white woman and bad in arrow amanda waller black woman bad. also in arrow bronze tiger black bad, in this one james olsen black good, race is not influencing there character morality and to suggest that is just diving way deep in a show your just meant to sit back shut of reality to watch and enjoy so plz people just stop bringin the real world into our fictional shows becuase your the only one seeing it. Nobody was watching Roseanne and saying oh the conservative agenda woe is me no its there characters and what they believe which while they might mirror what the real people believe they are not changing things to make them more or less biased to one side or the other ok done for tonight jeez i got to stop putting myself out here on this site im gonna be eaten alive in like 10 min im sure
Don't really want to get into a whole kerfluffle because every single episode of this or charmed or really any show nowadays is oh the liberal spin oh the feminism oh this character is gay, or a lesbian and its just annoying. I agree with more or less everything @Schrunsekris said mostly which i have said many MANY times on this site IT IS A FICTIONAL SHOW. Politicians are not using CW show to convince the public to change their ways. Do you know how foolish it would be for some Democrat or Republican either one (because they are not all just one kind of person who necessarily believe all of the values of their respective party) to sit at a podium and say "Well i was watching Supergirl last night and guys that Fictional superhero in a Fictional universe who as @Schrunsekris said stands up for any oppressed peoples says he/she/it/they dont believe in guns so I don't think we should. I understand no matter what everyone is going to keep on about there complaining about the "undertones'(keyword there) when really nobody cares about your views on them if you dont like the undertones dont keep watching just to complain go watch something more to your (non-liberal if that is what you want to call it) tastes. you people do realize this is a feminist show thats what it is its all about girl power, more main characters are female than male. This is a show meant for girls, I am not saying guys cannot enjoy it, i am a guy and i do. But for people to get so angry when a woman is the good guy and a man is a bad guy there is so clear low-level sexism going on. Not calling anyone in particular a sexist but if you have such a problem with a strong female presence in a show more so than a man you must have some sort of fear that the "patriarchy" if you think that is still somehow a thing will be toppled by supergirl. Its foolish. IT IS A SHOW really is and always will be my main point. I REPEAT YOU DONT HAVE TO AGREE WITH ANYTHING IM SAYING BUT YOU SHOULD AGREE THIS IS A FICTIONAL SHOW THAT NO ONE IS USING TO SWAY THE MINDS OF THE PUBLIC.......thats what the news is for
And again... lol ... whining about that the men seem to be weaker than women and it is not like in the Comics... I repeat myself " SO WHAT?" In Superman, Superman was always the strong man - and he also just ran into situations without thinking and not learning from past mistakes - it is a Show BASED on Comics, it doesn´t mean it has to be exactly like the Comics!! Tell me one TV Show which is exactly like the Comics???? .... And back to your "running off without thinking" - you watch Horrormovies and could yell "Noooo, don´t go into the dark basement, you know what happens in horrormovies...they will still do it!" Same for the "heroes" they go in, think they are unbeatable, get their asses kicked, get up, reasess the situation and than go back in and win the fight.... duh, thats what Comics are pretty much all about. You can watch or read any movie/Comic... the plot is kind of always the same... Doesn´t need a brainiac to figure that out.... And you really seem to be so upset about this feminism shit... I just don´t really see it..... In Superman/Smallville (where the bold guy was Lex Luther, if you remember) Lois was smart and Chloe too and they also were most of the times smarter than Clark or Jimmy.... Supergirl is often weak, so is Alex.... but the guys aswell...and I wouldn´t call James week just because he is trusting. Why shouldn´t they have mistakes anyway??? Noone is perfect. And about the "assumption on my part" - you seem to interpret "under tones of liberal politics, toxic feminism and gender issues" in every episode.... you assumpt aswell that they are all liberal and assuming this - not republican - without them saying anything about their politic views... ;) So again, It is just a damn show, if you don´t like the way it is going anymore, stop watching it.... other still like it.... I like to watch so many shows, why would I spend time on watching a show I don´t even like anymore and also would spend time writing and complaining about it? Maybe write a letter to the TV station, but here? Seems pretty pointless to repeat yourself over and over. But hey, if you have so much time on your hands, go for it lol Schrunseisout
@Cand1date and @HanFsc I just hate the fact it was not explained and everyone just accepted it day one, when it was never that way. The doctor should have been more shocked and wondered why and may have said something like that since all the time lords men and women gave him their regeneration that there was a chance he could be female now. Because that's what they did, and I would have been fine with it, they just din't do it that way. Poor story on their part would have been so much better to tell it like i said than to say that they thought it was time for a female doctor. I like her and the actress is amazing and made me fall back in love with the doctor who show again. She has captured the essence of the doctor in her performance that hearkens back to the older days.
so glad to see the prison thing over and arrow back to doing his thing at some point, they seemed to have missed the point of the comic. And have started focusing on everyone else. I think arrow teaming up is good and all but they really need to stop exposing his identity. Not sure where they are going with the story, as the dragon just pops up in small parts, and just feels like they over dramatize the others with the heroes, who are not wearing costumes. The show feels bogged down and they need to stop stretching an arch into an whole season, but flash and the others do the same.. 3 episodes should have been enough with the prison thing, and while that was going on a spit here and there of everyone else. Then in the 4th one have him set free and tell how it was done, then back to reforming a team, with red arrow or arsenal which ever they want to call him. Mr terrific and black cannery, which ever. mad dog can go his character in the comics was never a team player.
I'm with cand1date plus they made up regeneration when the first doctor died so they're down for whatever
You do realize that they changed cannon when they decided to give the doctor more than 12 regenerations. Once they gave unlimited lives, there was no reason that the doctor needed to be male forever either.
Schrunsekris, I don't fallow your rant because i agree with most of it "nobody complained when the bold rich white guy was the bad guy in Superman (who clearly would have been a republican in real life) " this is an assumption on your part and they never stated it in the move. That is what i am taking about the statements are blatant and in your face, and could be more subtle so as they don't over shadow the story or ruin the show. Not sure about the "stereotypes" rant ether as i agree comics are full of them as has always been and like the fact that this episode went ageist type and had a black woman as a person ageist aliens for humans. But all the main male characters are weak or cow down to the women in the show, it's bull shit. I have not seen very many shows to show that the male and female roles are equal, they feel they need to have the men weaker or gimped in some way. The writing and the make up on the show is horrid as well brainy looks like a reject from a old zombie movie. And as to comics the show has deviated so far with the castings and stories of the comics that it is only super girl in the sense that she is the main star. As for getting over it go fuck your self, i am voicing my opinion and will continue to do so so you fucking get over it. Oh and the "Supergirl is a girl and fights for the good that includes surpressed and wrongly treated people" she does but the character does not learn from mistakes and has not really grown much. She still runs off into danger thinking nothing can hurt her and in many of the shows she gets smacked down and almost killed. You would think she would stop just going off half cocked and do a bit of research and thinking planning even before. I keep thinking it may be a kyptonian thing and their brains are just hard wired that way in their genetic code or some thing. "TV Shows are full with stereotypes....Germans are Nazis or wear Lederhosen, Russians are cruel spies who deal with weapons, south americans are ruthless druglords and asian are superevil Ninjas... thats how it was in the past and will be over and over again" not sure what this was reference to maybe the part i said about white people and men but not sure just seems random to me.
I love this drama from Canada and have watched all eleven seasons and starting on season 12. The one thing that gets on my nerves is the theme music for this drama. To me it's like nails on a chalk board! I fast forward so I don't have to listen to it........
watch the key to time arch in the baker years and you will know what i mean as it was never a thing until they decide to change it recently.

It took the jolly sculpture of a banana farmer to make me revisit one of the shortest but historically important walks in the south of Tenerife. Some ten years ago I last passed under the stone archway of El Porton on the TF1 slip road below Adeje old town but a decades absence of my feet was hardly a blip in the ancient scheme of things.
For most visitors to Tenerife, Fañabe means modern shopping centers and a lengthy golden beach but a little further west the old original town rises into the hills behind the bridge over the motorway. The sculpture is a recent addition and I have been itching to see it up close, sadly there are no details of the sculptor or subject ( possible a nod to Fyffes who brought commercial banana farming to Tenerife), just a very lifelike and kindly presence complete with a sleeve of bananas. Crossing the road bridge and heading down over the Barranco del Agua a large swathe of the cloth protected fruit spread down towards the coast, a small, tatty scarecrow stood on guard.
El Porton marks one end of the Camino de la Virgen, an important track allowing fishermen to get their catch up to Adeje town and when pirates showed up they were able to transfer the statue of the Virgen from the tiny La Enramada to the safer inland church of Santa Ursula. The track of the pathway is etched with the constant flow of the years and despite the modern intrusion of the motorway, power lines, and the five star hotels at the bottom end, it still has a comforting serenity. The old water channel has long since dried up but the tabaiba, and cardon plants still thrive and defy the bone dry old reservoir.
It’s just a 2 km stroll but several stop offs along the way are set aside for worship, La Tosca Colorada is the first on the way down, the big focal point is El Humilladero where a natural altar has been carved out under a limestone outcrop. The second Sunday after Easter marks the big pilgrimage as the statue of the Virgen is taken down the route and onto the Playa La Enramada in La Caleta. Just across the modern main road at the bottom end is the old original church and it’s imposing modern replacement. I was greeted by a melodic peel of bells as the clock struck noon. It’s quite a contrast from the modern tourist hotels to the pathway up to Adeje with the added attraction of Roque del Conde in the distance. I was very pleased with my short journey and I’m sure the banana loving sculpture at the other end will still have his benevolent smile next time I see him.

Today, the average age for a person to begin dating is 13. Research has shown that serious adolescent relationships before either partner is emotionally mature can have detrimental effects for identity formation and even life and health.
Teen pregnancy, Sexually transmitted infections, broken hearts, and depression, are common themes for those who work with teens.
It is tough to accept facts like they are into relationships, or that they have started lying, or that they have access to cigarettes and alcohol, etc.
Not only is everyone trying to figure out the knew dynamic of raging hormones, but parents may questions the judgment and safety of their teen and the teenager resents any interference on part of the parents.

Small pottery cups are often found buried in Bronze Age graves alongside other pots. They are sometimes called accessory vessels. Archaeologists are not sure what the function of these tiny pots was. Pots were made on a household scale and vary greatly in size and shape.
Prehistoric pots were coil-built. This means they were made by building up rings of clay and smoothing the sides to flatten the bumpy surface. Extra material, known as temper, was mixed into the clay to diffuse heat and stop pots from exploding during firing. Pieces of stone, straw and grog (broken up bits of old pots) were used for this purpose.

The television series Agatha Christie’s Poirot ran from 1989 to 2013 and contained 70 episodes. If you were to take any one of those episodes, give it a much higher production budget and fill it with A-list actors, you’d have Kenneth Branagh’s Murder on the Orient Express. Rather than try to upend Agatha Christie’s novel or the mystery genre in general, Branagh plays by the rules, wrapping the tale in a handsomely crafted production that has a surprising blend of humor and fun despite the weight of finding a murderer. It’s only at the end when Branagh’s tight direction can’t handle piecing together the crime and the themes become disappointing despite an attempt to give Poirot a character arc.
Famous detective Hercule Poirot (Branagh) has hitched a ride on the luxurious Orient Express thanks to his devious friend Bouc (Tom Bateman). During the trip, one of the passengers is murdered and the train becomes snowbound. While workers try to dig out the engine, Poirot reluctantly decides to solve the crime. He interviews the passengers who would have had access to the scene of the crime and discovers that there’s far more happening than a simple murder.
Murder on the Orient Express was published in 1934, but it’s now been around for so long that the solution to the crime has receded from the public consciousness, so I won’t spoil that here or even go into more detail than the trailers, which won’t even reveal the passenger who dies. However, even if you’ve read the book, you’ll find Branagh’s take to be a highly enjoyable experience that takes advantage of the director’s penchant for rich, warm, classical direction that wraps you up like a warm blanket.
Branagh hasn’t made a movie to challenge his audience as much as he’s made it to comfort them. Even though it’s a murder mystery yarn, everything in the production is functioning at a level of highest craftsmanship. The cast, especially Michelle Pfeiffer, Josh Gad, and Willem Dafoe, who play passengers/suspects, are superb, Haris Zambarloukos’ cinematography rises to the challenge of a movie mostly shot in one location to avoid ever feeling stagey, Patrick Doyle provides a great score, and the whole production has the same kind of gorgeous, rich look of Branagh’s past films Cinderella and Hamlet.
Where Murder on the Orient Express falls apart is at the climax of the film. Despite the exquisite staging and even the melodrama that somehow works (Poirot says with a straight face, “You will have to answer to two people: Your god, and Hercule Poirot.”), there are some elements where a book is able to get away with things a movie can’t. What the reader will allow becomes far more difficult to visualize on screen, and in his grand revelation, Poirot reveals facts that the audience would have had no way of knowing, thus making it impossible to have our suspicions confirmed or denied.
The ending becomes even more difficult based on Poirot’s reaction to the crime. Again, not to give anything away, but it creates a moral conundrum the movie isn’t fit to solve. Rather than grappling with the weight of the crime, the movie simply shrugs it off, has Poirot slightly adjust his moral code, and move on to the next case. It’s a disappointing, sloppy end for a film that had, for the most part, felt meticulously crafted.
But before you reach that ending, it’s still an enjoyable feature, and even the conclusion isn’t enough to derail the old-fashioned storytelling that the film provides. If Murder on the Orient Express was the start of a new Poirot franchise starring Kenneth Branagh and every new entry was handsomely produced and wonderfully cast, I’d happily turn up to see that series. I just hope they come to better conclusions.

The paper deals with the rutting failure of a full-depth asphalt pavement, determined on the assumption that it is related to the bearing capacity mechanism, which in this case acts in the pavement itself. Hitherto, this analysis had been based on a model with isotropic strength parameters, and confined to conventional flexible pavement with tire pressures of 100 psi. On the other hand, compacted mixtures are known to be anisotropic, and their strength varies with their vertical temperature profile, especially in the full-depth case. The present analysis utilizes influence of an extension of Hill&apos;s failure mechanism to include the effect of temperature and anisotropic properties. It is shown that the bearing capacity of full-depth asphalt pavement depends strongly on wheel dimension, the vertical temperature profile, and anisotropic properties of the asphalt mixture. Using the extensive model of bearing capacity, design curves are developed for design asphalt mixtures for full-depth asphalt pavements. It is shown that for high tire pressure, which exists in modern aircrafts, the conventional method of design is not applicable.
Equations were derived which govern the lateral-torsional buckling of parabolic arches. Buckling loads were obtained for a uniform applied loading. Both free-standing and crown restrained arches with fixed and hinged end support were considered. A comparison was made, wherever possible, between some of the buckling loads calculated and existing theoretical and experimental loads. Good agreement was evidenced.
Joseph Lister, First Baron Lister (1827 -1912) was an English sur­geon whose great contribution was the development of antiseptic surgery through the use of chemical disinfec­tants. This development is probably second only to Pasteur‘s contribution in terms of the saving of human lives. He also made notable contributions in surgery and founded what.would later become the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine in London. He was president of both the Royal Society and the British Association and was eventually raised to the peerage. Even with so many honors, he, like many other great Christian scientists, was still a humble and gracious man. Of Quaker background, Lord Lister was a firm believer throughout his life. He wrote:

James was training with his rescue team to learn how to rescue and help out during floods and other natural disasters. They went through the procedures of preparing for the worst of the worst which rarely happen out here in Newfoundland it was mostly flooding or tornadoes. James and his team mate walked back to the common room to get a drink and talk about each others day. James but their conversation was cut short by an alarm going off they both rushed out of the room and headed to their cars four people to a car and they headed out to the town to prepare people for this disaster one James' team mates picked up the walkie talkie “this is car 224 to base what is the disaster that we should be preparing the people for”. They waited for a moment in silence to hear their order from base as to what they should do James looked out the windows to see the skies darkening he went through the signs of the disaster this might be leading to "what do you think it is Damian" James squirmed in his seat at the question "I'm not sure *** it could be anything we just have to hope for the best and pray to God that it is not a hurricane.
William, or as people often called him, Bill, had been one of the older members of the rescue team, having helped mainly with supplies, and organization rather than actually running out to save people. He always argued that he wasn’t too old to do things, that he didn’t need to sit down and rest, etc, etc.
He had been a damn soldier, he didn’t need no pampering from the young’uns. It was bad enough that he was stuck here, 79 years in the future, and of course, in the very place where his own grandson called home. Of course, this meant that he had survived the war and have children with his darling Kathleen. He couldn’t tell anyone this, no need to look like some crazy old man now.
So, as the years slowly crept by, William tried his hardest to fix his compass, to return to his own time, and live out his days like everyone else.
He had been sent home when the storm had began to brew, and much to his insistent arguing, had left. William did have one reason to actually listen for once, he had finally found the last piece he needed! A shipment had come in, carting some exotic items, at least to the people who lived on the island. Among the jewelry, and pottery had been a few smaller, more delicate items, one of which, he had been hunting down for some time now.
Thus, when William returned to his small home, he had put the kettle on and set to work repairing his compass.

OneWorld South Asia invites all key actors working in the field of education and with ICTs in India, and representing the public sector, the private sector, civil society, and communities for a half-day consultation to explore the different tools and methodologies to enhance the access to schools with quality education. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />
The consultation also intends to explore the synergies between the application of ICTs and the formal education system in a systematic manner and to examine the impact of such technologies relative to other tools and resources that are currently available. The meeting is intended to serve as a consultative platform for the select group to identify substantive issues that predominate in the context of education. Then, drawing upon the expertise and experience of the participants (in terms of their ongoing programmes), a set of strategic recommendations could be arrived at, towards the mainstreaming of ICTs for UEE. It would also be useful to establish synergies between the recommendations and the existing policy framework. These recommendations can be forwarded to the relevant persons so that they can be considered for inclusion in the policy-making processes.
Abstract This report records the results of botanical surveys of beach areas in and near Fiordland National Park. These surveys were initiated at beaches for which mineral prospecting warrants had been applied for. More extensive survey followed when it became apparent that sand dunes in this area, although small, still hold good examples of native dune vegetation, this having largely disappeared in many other parts of the South Island because of weed infestation and agricultural modification. The report describes and illustrates the vegetation of each beach, lists native and adventive plants, discusses troublesome weeds, browsing animals and other threats to native vegetation. (auth)

New children's book out soon! Carlos Alberto Machado wrote this twelve stories for Inês and invited me to illustrate them. The book is presented on 5th May, 6:00pm, in Biblioteca Camões (Lisbon).
Happy to share some images of my latest contribution to "Cão Celeste", magazine published by Inês Dias and Manuel de Freitas, with art direction by Luís Henriques. This time I worked in a drawing/collage with no specific theme and here's the result! On the other page there's a poem by Emanuel Jorge Botelho. Cover art by Daniela Lisboa Gomes!
At 18 he moved to Lisbon to study architecture, meteorology and hat-design. He attended the Illustration Program in CITEN - Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian (2005/2006) as well as short courses in AR.CO - Centro de Arte e Comunicação Visual.
He has been illustrating books, fanzines, magazines, and also works in partnership with theatre companies and other cultural projects, taking part in numerous solo / group exhibitions.
He created the illustration and poetry magazine INÚTIL (with Maria Quintans and Ana Lacerda). He currently runs the small publishing house 'não (edições)', which he founded in 2013.
In his drawings he explores the gesture, the imperfection and even the 'mistake' through different media: charcoal, graphic pen and colored pencils are some of his favorites. "A collage a day" (one at least!) could be his motto.

So, who got snubbed in this week's Pro Bowl selections ? I don't know - just askin'. Nobody else seems to know either. Anyway, I was hoping for and expecting sheer chaos to unfold over the last two weeks with regard to the "Playoff Chase". You know, when untimely upsets happen and teams on the fringe suddenly find themselves in the cat bird seat. But, this year, especially in the NFC, those in playoff positions keep on winning - as do the teams just on the outside looking in. As it happens, the talent gap in the NFL between the haves and have nots, is pretty large. In the NFC the gaps in playoff odds from the last team in (Atlanta) and the first team out (Detroit) is a whopping 54%. For Detroit to catch Atlanta - the Lions will have to win out while the Falcons lose out. Because Atlanta beat Detroit head to head, Atlanta holds the tie breaker. Makes that goofy yet meaningless win by Atlanta in September, (where the Lions ran out of downs on the 2 inch line on a 10 second runoff on an officials timeout), look pretty important now. In the AFC its a bit more scrambled. Four 8-6 teams are vying for 3 spots, and the Ravens are the odd team out. However, they also have a 94% chance of making the playoffs due to a schedule that finishes with match-ps against the Colts and Bengals. The Chiefs should win ther division and have a 95% chance of getting in. On the other hand, the Titans wrap-up with the Jags and Rams, and the Bills finish with the Patriots and Dolphins. Odds are on the Bills to lose out since the Titans hold the tiebreaker.
This week in dirty-dawg, THREE of you (yes, I said THREE in caps) were perfect. Eric Jones, Brian Walawender, and Ken Drozd all pulled off the coveted 15-0 record. In the overall standings though, it was Jerry Bailey (the famous former Kentucky Derby Jockey) vaulting back into first place with 106 points (despite his small stature). This places him just ahead of Brandon Bigelbach and Tina Fausey. In group play, its Hellraisers comfortably ahead of the Harvey Crusaders and The Juice. Be sure to get your picks in for week 16, and have a great Christmas weekend !

It was interesting. First, I went swimming trying to board the boat from the dock but that was pretty much expected. Then I got it out in the water to find that there was even less wind than I expected, so after turning this way and that trying to catch a breeze, I finally gave up and paddled back to the ramp.
When I attempted to recover the boat, I found that it has a leak in the daggerboard chase and had taken on water, so I have a muscle strain from trying to lift the bow up on the trailer. Probably a good thing there was no wind.
"The truly dangerous man dresses inconspicuously and is soft- spoken. He walks away from most confrontations. The only time you learn that the truly dangerous man is mad at you is a split second before you die, for he never fights. He only kills. The truly dangerous man knows that fighting is what children do and killing is what men do." - Charley Reese 1986

Hi, I'm Rainey McGuigan and I'd like to extend a warm welcome to you. Thank you for visiting my site, Disaster Shelters. For the past few years, I've been a Peace Corps volunteer in Africa, and during that time I've discovered how important a well-built disaster shelter can be. Recently it occurred to me that it would be a good idea if I could create a place where I could bring all of this great experience and put it in one place. The end result was this little site; a place where you can get information on every aspect of disaster shelters. I'd like this site to be interactive, so if you have any questions or would like to leave a message, please feel free. Thanks for stopping by.
Discern Partner Tom Valuck and Director Russ Montgomery authored two articles in a recent supplemental issue of the Journal of Palliative Medicine. In their article “Data Needs for a Serious Illness Care Accountability System: A Framework and Recommendations,” they highlight the additional data that are needed to implement more robust measurement systems, value-based payment models, and innovative care delivery models for seriously ill populations.
In addition, they co-authored the article “Accountability for Community-Based Programs for the Seriously Ill” with leading national palliative care researchers and experts, including Joan Teno and Diane Meier. This article presents a vision and roadmap for the development and implementation of new accountability systems for serious illness, including guiding principles for quality measurement and a “starter set” of measures.
These articles build on Discern’s previous work on serious illness care, which includes white papers and Health Affairs blog posts on payment models and quality measures. This work was funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.

Port el-Kantaoui was established in 1977 as Tunisia's first purpose-built tourist resort, and is now a fully-fledged town. Modelled on the French Riviera's Port-Grimaud, the resort is built in Andalucian-Moorish style around a huge marina and is popular with the Mediterranean jet set and european tourists. The buzzing waterfront is lined with restaurants, hotels, cocktail bars and swanky boutiques.
Designed in a traditional Tunisian style, the resort is made up of brilliant white buildings, cobbled streets and narrow walkways. This upmarket resort has little to do with Tunisia, but that is one of the reasons Tunisians love it, and perhaps why so many visitors never leave it.

The Bible tells us, we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God. When we die, our eternal destiny is sealed. God’s mercy does not extend beyond the grave. Because of sin, we are eternally separated from God. We are eternally lost. God has provided a way to escape this death sentence. All sin must be paid for, so God sent His only begotten Son to pay the price for your sins, to pay your sentence of death. Jesus died a horrible death on the cross. He was marred worse than any man. They plucked out His beard. They tortured Him, whipped Him, spit on Him, and mocked Him. Jesus Christ, God’s only begotten Son, suffered this torment for you, to redeem you, to purchase you, so that you might have life and have it more abundantly.
To receive God’s forgiveness, you must be willing to trust in Jesus Christ as your only hope of salvation. This is done by faith. You receive God’s forgiveness through faith. You must be willing to turn from all sin (repent) and obey the Gospel. In this message, I wish to examine the following items: what is sin, what is repentance, how do we trust in Jesus, how are we redeemed, and one method Satan uses to deceive us.
In today’s churches, the fear of God is seldom preached, yet fear is mentioned in the Bible about 396 times. We are not to fear what man can do to us, but we are to fear God. Pv 14:2 tells us, HE THAT WALKETH IN HIS UPRIGHTNESS FEARETH THE LORD. Jesus spoke these words in Mt 10:28-FEAR NOT THEM WHICH KILL THE BODY, BUT ARE NOT ABLE TO KILL THE SOUL: BUT RATHER FEAR HIM WHICH IS ABLE TO DESTROY BOTH BODY SOUL AND BODY IN HELL. God does not give us a spirit of fear, but of power. We are to trust in Jesus. We are to fear no man or circumstances. We love God with all our heart. The Scriptures tell us to fear the Lord and depart from evil. Therefore, Satan will attempt to tell you not to fear God and His judgments. We recall when we are approaching a traffic light, we do not go through the red light for fear that we will get a ticket. It is not our love for the police officer that stops us from going through a red light, but rather fearing that we will get caught. We may be speeding down a highway. We know it is wrong, yet we do it. All of a sudden, we see a police officer parked along the side of the highway. So what do we do? Immediately, we get a bit scared, and may look to our speedometer and slow down. Why? Because we are afraid we will get a ticket. If the police officer comes after us with his siren going, what emotion do we feel? Is it not fear that we will get a ticket, with perhaps even further consequences, such as we may have to go to court? Do we slow down because we love the police officer or because we are afraid? Likewise, we are to fear the Lord and depart from evil.
So we may ask, "How does Satan work to stop us from fearing God?" Let us look at Gen. 3:1. Satan first caused doubt in Eve’s mind about what God had said, by saying the words, YEA, HATH GOD SAID, YE SHALL NOT EAT OF EVERY TREE OF THE GARDEN? Note: Satan did not say eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. He said, EAT OF EVERY TREE. Then Satan goes on to counter God’s command by saying in verse 4-YE SHALL NOT SURELY DIE. He contradicts God’s words. In doing so, he eliminates the one thing that could prevent Eve from eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Satan tells Eve, YE SHALL NOT SURELY DIE. In doing this, he eliminated the fear of God’s judgment. God had warned not to eat of the tree of the KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL-Gen 2:17. God gave further warning of what the consequences of disobedience would be. The sentence or judgment for disobedience would be Gen 2:17-FOR IN THE DAY THAT THOU EATEST THEREOF THOU SHALT SURELY DIE. Therefore, they were afraid to disobey God, for surely they did not want to die. Thus, Satan realized he must eliminate the fear of God’s judgment. Satan must eliminate from Adam and Eve, their fear of God, and what He would do. He accomplished this by saying, YE SHALL NOT SURELY DIE. By creating doubt, the clarity of God’s warning and the fear of God’s judgment was eliminated. After further being tempted by Satan, Eve chose to believe Satan’s lies. She went forth without fearing God, and did sin. She may willingly have chosen to believe the devil’s word over God’s Word, because her heart wanted to eat of the fruit after she was tempted.
Satan has also accomplished the same in many churches today. Many preach the love of God, but only a few preach the fear of God as the Scriptures teach. Know this, Heb 9:27-IT IS APPOINTED UNTO MEN ONCE TO DIE, BUT AFTER THIS THE JUDGMENT. Satan is cunning beyond all of your expectations. For this reason, we do not go by feelings, but rather, we are to live by the "Word of God".
Dr. Karl Menninger asked the question, "Whatever became of sin?" An outstanding prison reformer and psychiatrist, he states, "Almost no one talks about it (sin) anymore. We don’t talk about sin on weekdays, and we hear about it only a few minutes on Sunday, if at all." A minister in England declared the Ten Commandments were not applicable for today. He ordered their discontinuance from his services. But the Bible says, BY THE LAW IS THE KNOWLEDGE OF SIN-Ro 3:20. An old-fashioned, Methodist preacher did not beat around the bush when preaching on sin. He called it the abominable thing that God hates. Later, one of his members came to him saying, "We don’t like you to talk so plainly about sin." Replied the preacher as he picked up a bottle of strychnine clearly marked with a skull and crossbones, "Suppose I take off this label of poison and put on some mild label such as essence of peppermint? Don’t you see what happens? The milder you make the label, the more dangerous you make the poison." As a physician does not prescribe an aspirin for cancer, but may order immediate surgery, so it is with sin. Sin must be removed, blotted out, forgiven! And that is the reason for which Jesus came. He came to save sinners. He died for our sins that we might be forgiven. In 1Jn 1:7 we read, THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST HIS SON CLEANSETH US FROM ALL SIN. The Bible says, BE NOT DECEIVED. Sin offers pleasure, but produces death. Sin corrupts man’s nature, perverts his tastes, weakens his will, and sears his conscience.
1. Pv 24:9-THE THOUGHT OF FOOLISHNESS IS SIN. How much time do we spend in needless jesting and joking? Paul writing to the Ephesian Christians reminds them on account of FOOLISH TALKING…AND JESTING...COMETH THE WRATH OF GOD UPON THE CHILDREN OF DISOBEDIENCE-Eph 5:4,6. Certainly, we are not to be long-faced. There is joy in serving the Lord. Nevertheless, we are reminded, THE THOUGHT OF FOOLISHNESS IS SIN.
2. In 1 Jn 5:17 we read, ALL UNRIGHTEOUSNESS IS SIN. There should not be any confusion as to what is wrong. Lying, cheating, stealing, murder, adultery, fornication, etc., are all sins.
3. In Ro 14:23 we read, WHATSOEVER IS NOT OF FAITH IS SIN. In other words, we should believe that what we are doing is right and conforms to the principles of God’s Word. Hypocrisy is sin. Withholding the truth is sin. Martin Luther once said, "If I profess with the loudest voice and clearest exposition every portion of the truth of God, except precisely that little point which the world and the devil are at that moment attacking, I am not confessing Christ, however boldly I may be professing Christ. In other words, it is a form of denying Christ.
4. Another definition is found in Ja 2:9, IF YE HAVE RESPECT TO PERSONS, YE COMMIT SIN. The Gospel knows no color boundaries, no race distinctions, no social levels, and no denominational barriers when a person is truly born-again; for we are one in Christ.
5. Again, James declares, THEREFORE TO HIM THAT KNOWETH TO DO GOOD, AND DOETH IT NOT, TO HIM IT IS SIN-Ja 4:17. To receive Christ, is life’s greatest decision. Whereas to refuse Christ, is to spend eternity in the lake of fire. What should you be doing that you are not doing, but are being convicted of by the Holy Spirit? Could it be reading your Bible more, having family devotions, praying more, visiting the sick and shut-ins, witnessing to the lost, giving to the ministries in need of your help? Sin is not only doing the "wrong things", but it is also failing to do the right things. As we understand, Charles H. Spurgeon, perhaps the most famous preacher of the 19th century, was the guest of a man who always boasted of things he did not do. Finally, disgusted with the man’s self-righteousness, Spurgeon could stand it no longer, and replied, "Why man, you are simply a bundle of negatives. You don’t drink! You don’t gamble! You don’t swear! What in the name of goodness do you do?"
6. Another definition for sin is found in 1 Jn 3:4, which reminds us that, SIN IS THE TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW. To drive 70 miles per hour when the speed limit is 55 is transgression of the law. The word transgression means to "go beyond a mark". Adam and Eve transgressed when they violated God’s commandment.
With these Bible definitions of sin, we are reminded of the truth of Ro 3:23, FOR ALL HAVE SINNED, AND COME SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD. That makes us all sinners in need of salvation. Picture a deep chasm several feet across. There are those seen jumping, in an effort to get to the other side, but they plunge to their death below. Then a bridge is built, so all can travel across the chasm safely. In like manner, Christ is the Bridge. Though ALL HAVE SINNED, we read HE HATH MADE HIM TO BE SIN FOR US, THAT WE MIGHT BE MADE THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD IN HIM-2 Cor 5:21. What sacrifice He made to atone for your sins and mine. As a certain songwriter put it, "O the love that drew salvation’s plan; O the grace that brought it down to man: O the mighty gulf that God did span, at Calvary!"
Is this what you want? Do you want to be set free from the law of sin, which has an ugly hold upon you as the fangs of a snake, or the teeth of a lion? Then realize our Lord triumphed over Satan (Lucifer), the subtle serpent, who also walketh about as a roaring lion. He is victorious over every foe. In "HIM", you are victorious, too. Are you a slave to an ideology or slave to a system? Unless a man turns his life over to Jesus Christ, he will always be a slave: a slave to his own lust and passion, a slave to sin and Satan. I ask you for the sake of your eternal welfare, where will you spend eternity? For your soul’s sake, surrender all to Jesus Christ.
It is disobedience to God. It is disobeying His Word. Sin is ultimately against God. It is doing things that we are not to do, and it is not doing things that we should do. It is not having a Christ-like attitude and not doing what Christ would do in every situation. It is speaking things that we ought not to speak, and it is not speaking things that we ought to speak. Sin is being stiff-necked, stubborn, and rebellious to correction from God’s Word. Sin is wrong response to God’s divine standards. It is rebelling against, falling short, or deviating from the ways that God has established; as it is written, Isa 30:21-THIS IS THE WAY, WALK YE IN IT. Sin is turning to the left or to the right-ref Deut 5:32, when God says to walk straight ahead or turn around. Sin is not walking IN ALL THE WAYS WHICH THE LORD GOD HATH COMMANDED YOU-ref Deut 5:33. Sin is not walking in the newness of life, not living and yielding unto God, and not obeying God from the heart. Sin is not yielding your bodies servants to righteousness unto holiness. Sin is not bringing forth fruit unto God or being conformed to the image of His Son. Sin is walking after the flesh and after self. Sin is not being ashamed of your past fruits or deeds-ref Ro 6. It is missing God’s mark but even more.
When a person follows self, they (or what the Bible calls the old man) is the center of their own universe. When a person follows Jesus, Jesus becomes the center of their universe.
Man’s very nature wants to deny what sin is. Some men’s consciences are so corrupt that it is as if they are seared with a hot iron. They can do the most hideous acts and yet wipe their mouth and say, "I’ve done no wrong." They feel no shame or guilt no matter what they do. Man’s corrupt thinking wants to deny he does or did wrong. He wants to accuse and point fingers at others and justify himself. Man’s very nature from birth is wicked from the fall of Adam. People’s very nature is wrapped up in self, not in God. A child does not have to be taught to lie and disobey his parents. It is natural. Rather a child needs to be taught to be truthful and obey his parents. Which keeps a child in check? Is it because he loves his parents or is it the fear of being spanked? It is by the fear of God that men depart from evil-ref Pv 16:6, not by the love of God. Those people that do not fear God as they ought or refuse to believe it is God that chastens them when they do wrong, often continue to do wrong. As it is written, THERE IS NO FEAR OF GOD BEFORE THEIR EYES-Ro 1:18. Not only do people sin against God’s Word, but they usually think nothing about breaking some of their own laws. For example, do people consider it wrong to break the speed limit, run red lights, or not come to a complete stop at stop signs? Does man consider it wrong to curse God’s name or listen to others doing it, even in the movies or on television? Do most people consider it wrong to lie in every situation or just in some situations? Man is so corrupt in his thinking that he says he believes in God, and he believes that God cannot lie, yet he refuses to believe all that God said in His Word. Many claim they believe in God but do not believe that God created all things. They choose to believe in the lie of evolution and many other such things contrary to the Bible. Man does and chooses to believe that which is right in his own eyes, and then he justifies it even when God’s Word tell him he is wrong. It is written, Jere 17:9-THE HEART IS DECEITFUL ABOVE ALL THINGS, AND DESPERATELY WICKED: WHO CAN KNOW IT? Ro 3:23-FOR ALL HAVE SINNED, AND COME SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD. Ro 3:10-THERE IS NONE RIGHTEOUS, NO, NOT ONE. ISA 64:6-WE ARE ALL AS AN UNCLEAN THING, AND ALL OUR RIGHTEOUSNESSES ARE AS FILTHY RAGS; AND WE ALL DO FADE AS A LEAF; AND OUR INIQUITIES, LIKE THE WIND, HAVE TAKEN US AWAY.
Mankind by nature is spiritually dead. People are by nature the servants or slaves of sin and of their own lusts and warped desires. All need redemption. All need to repent. All need to acknowledge their sin, confess their sins, deny self and surrender their will to God’s will. All need Jesus for without Jesus, only eternal damnation lies ahead. Jesus came to save His people from their sins. Few people in a lukewarm, financially prosperous, comfort-seeking, and pleasure-filled society will do this. Few will give up and forsake all now in order to obtain eternity with Jesus later. Many use the Satan motivated sayings, "These Scriptures do not really mean what they say," or "That's your interpretation, and it's wrong."
It is written Mt 7:20-WHEREFORE BY THEIR FRUITS YE SHALL KNOW THEM. A mature believer is to be known by their Christ-like attitude and overcoming sin in their daily lives. A mature believer is known by his humble, childlike, no excuse, no self-justification, and repentant attitude toward all correction from God, from His Word, from those He speaks through, including His servants that He has ordained to be over us. The more a person understands God, the more broken and humble he becomes. The closer a person gets to God, the more sinful he can see himself when viewed in light of God’s Word and God’s holiness, even as clean white clothes look good in a dim light, but when viewed in a bright light, one can see all the dirt. The lukewarm, Laodicean church of today has a very dim light indeed when looking at sin. The more sinful a person sees himself, the more he loves God as he understands the wonderful merciful, loving kindness of God called "grace," which came as a result of the horrible sacrifice but glorious resurrection of Jesus.
Jesus came to save people from their sins. A person must put their faith and trust in Jesus Christ as their only hope of salvation. It must be the Jesus Christ of the Bible, not another Christ. A person must repent. After a person comes to Christ in trust and repentance, then he is commanded to be baptized as it is written. He is born-again and no longer comes under the law of sin and of death, but now comes under the law of liberty. The person receives God’s Spirit by faith-ref Gal 3:2 to help him overcome sin.
I finally heard a "St. Peter at the Pearly Gates" story worth repeating. This had to do with a rather learned and pious minister of a large church.
The good pastor was quite confident as he approached Peter, seeking entrance into heaven. "I’m sure you heard of me," he told the apostle. "I’ve occupied a very important pulpit for the past forty years and sent quite a few people your way. I imagine my good works have been noticed up here, and now I’d like to come in."
"Actually, we haven’t heard of you," Peter replied, "but we have a point system in heaven in order to be fair to everyone. Perhaps, you could outline your career in the ministry for me, and I’ll give you the appropriate score for each of your actions."
The pastor was very cooperative. For the next hour or so, he related to the patient Peter, work after good work, especially emphasizing his unblemished character and his forgiving nature. At the end of it all, Peter was duly impressed. At length, he told the minister, that he would award him a "10".
"Does this mean I can go into heaven now?" "Not at all," said Peter. "You need 100 points." The church man was aghast. "Are you kidding?" he exclaimed. "I spent my whole life in the service of the Gospel, and you’re giving me a measly 10 points!"
Peter said, "Can you offer me anything more that we might credit for you?" Well, as the day wore on the minister kept digging around for every conceivable good service he had ever done for the Lord, his church, his community, his denomination, etc., etc. The hour grew late. The pastor’s jacket was thrown over a chair, and his tie was loosened. Perspiring, he finally looked up at Peter piteously, and said, "Dear apostle, surely there is mercy in heaven. How many points do I have now?" "Twenty points," Peter told him. "Oh, I just don’t understand this!" exclaimed the pastor, who was extremely frustrated. "Where will I ever get the 80 more points? If it weren’t for the grace of God, nobody would ever get into this place!"
Acts 2:38 tells us, REPENT, AND BE BAPTIZED EVERY ONE OF YOU. Have you obeyed this command? Have you committed your life to Jesus Christ, or to a church or denomination? Jesus is calling. Sinner come home.
Every person has sinned. As it is written, FOR ALL HAVE SINNED, AND COME SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD-Ro 3:23.
AND THE LORD GOD PLANTED A GARDEN EASTWARD IN EDEN; AND THERE HE PUT THE MAN WHOM HE HAD FORMED-Gen 2:8. AND THE LORD GOD TOOK THE MAN, AND PUT HIM INTO THE GARDEN OF EDEN TO DRESS IT AND TO KEEP IT. Note, that the Lord put Adam where He wanted him to be, and gave him work to do (to work it and take care of it). AND THE LORD GOD COMMANDED THE MAN, SAYING, OF EVERY TREE OF THE GARDEN THOU MAYEST FREELY EAT: BUT OF THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL, THOU SHALT NOT EAT OF IT: FOR IN THE DAY THAT THOU EATEST THEREOF THOU SHALT SURELY DIE-Gen 2:15-17. Adam could eat of every tree, except one. God had given Adam a command. Sin is disobeying God’s commandments. God also warned Adam of the consequences of disobeying His command. The penalty for disobedience was death. Adam’s obedience was going to be tested. We are to fear God-ref Lk 12:5. For it is written, BY THE FEAR OF THE LORD MEN DEPART FROM EVIL-Pv 16:6. We need to understand that THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH-Ro 6:23. We surmise that Adam feared God and His judgment. Adam had the choice of believing God’s Word or not believing it. Note that Adam had fellowship with God. No sin separated him from God.
As we examine how Satan deceived Eve, let us be mindful that he uses many of these same devices on us today. He speaks to us in our thoughts, through other people, through situations, through our flesh and emotions, and through unexpected ways to cause us to do contrary to what God would have us do. He lies to us. Sometimes he mixes the truth with lies. He stirs up our emotions. He uses our anger, bitterness, fears, jealousy, envy, love, and even good intentions to persuade us to do contrary to God's will. He uses temptations, persecutions, and threats. He uses the pleasures of this life, the deceitfulness of riches, the lusts of other things, and cares of this world. He uses things that our heart desires. He uses our ambitions to get ahead, and prosper, and to get more things. He uses our desire to be someone special. He makes us think we are doing what God wants us to do, when in reality, we are disobeying God. He causes many to believe the Bible is not true, and others to believe the Bible does not mean what it really says. He causes many to believe he does not exist. He causes others to greatly underestimate his powers of deception. Because of Satan's lies, we become confused, and the Word of God becomes twisted in our minds. He uses Scripture in our thoughts in such a way, that we become deceived. He causes us not to hate sin and every evil way. He causes us to think we will never have to face the judgment of God. He causes us to think we will go to heaven, when in reality, we are on our way to hell. He causes us to examine ourselves and our relationship to God by emotions, rather than by the truth of the Gospel. He causes us to have many distractions when we open our Bible to read and to study. He may send people to us who look like true Christians, but they are in reality, wolves in sheep’s clothing. And if God sends someone to us, Satan puts in our thoughts reasons to cause us to believe the person is not from God at all. Satan causes us to think the thoughts we are having, which cause us to sin, are really our own thoughts. Other times, he causes us to think the thoughts we are having are from God, when they are really from Satan.
Satan is a master of deception. As it is written, THAT OLD SERPENT, CALLED THE DEVIL, AND SATAN, WHICH DECEIVETH THE WHOLE WORLD-Rev 12:9. Satan is also called the accuser-Rev 12:10.
In Ezekiel chapter 28, we see some references pertaining to Satan. In verse 12, we see the words, FULL OF WISDOM, AND PERFECT IN BEAUTY. In verse 13, THOU HAST BEEN IN EDEN THE GARDEN OF GOD. Verse 13 also shows us, he was CREATED. Verse 17 tells us, THINE HEART WAS LIFTED UP BECAUSE OF THY BEAUTY, THOU HAST CORRUPTED THY WISDOM BY REASON OF THY BRIGHTNESS. Isa 14:12-14 gives us additional information, O LUCIFER, SON OF THE MORNING!...THOU HAST SAID IN THINE HEART…I WILL EXALT MY THRONE ABOVE THE STARS OF GOD…I WILL BE LIKE THE MOST HIGH. Thus, we note that the serpent, was FULL OF WISDOM, and PERFECT IN BEAUTY, and had much BRIGHTNESS. Most people greatly underestimate Satan’s ability to deceive.
NOW THE SERPENT (which is also called Satan, the Devil, and Lucifer) WAS MORE SUBTIL (or crafty) THAN ANY BEAST (or wild animal) OF THE FIELD WHICH THE LORD GOD HAD MADE. AND HE SAID UNTO THE WOMAN, YEA, HATH GOD SAID (or did God really say), YE SHALL NOT EAT OF EVERY TREE OF THE GARDEN?-Gen 3:1. The serpent, which is also called Satan, now begins a process of causing Eve to be confused, deceived, to doubt what God had said, and, ultimately, to cause her to disobey God’s command. You and I hear that same voice today in our thoughts. Also note, that the serpent did not use God’s words in this case, but rather used an evasive, deceptive approach, by saying, "HATH GOD SAID" and then using the words, "YE SHALL NOT EAT OF EVERY TREE OF THE GARDEN?" As the serpent spoke, he did not call God, Lord God (or Jehovah God), but addressed him only as God, perhaps trying to belittle Jehovah God. From the first three words, "HATH GOD SAID," it can be seen that the serpent is an enemy of God. He is attempting to bring doubt about the Word of God. He is challenging God’s Word. He begins with a question to open the conversation. It is as if he wants to know something, but it is really the beginning of a deception. It is intended to cause doubt in the woman’s mind. God is not the author of confusion, but Satan is-ref l Cor 14:33. Thus, we have the beginning of the serpent’s attack in causing the woman to doubt, to be confused, and to be deceived. Eve did not understand the great deceptive and crafty ways of the devil. She underestimated the devil, as people also do today. The woman should have turned away, but she did not. She chose to enter into dialogue with the serpent. That dialogue proved to be a great mistake. She did not realize that the devil was her enemy. The serpent also seems to be implying that God is too demanding and overbearing, and He does not really love the woman, because she could eat of every tree, except one. Surely, if God really loved her, He would give her everything she wanted.
AND THE WOMAN SAID UNTO THE SERPENT, WE MAY EAT OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREES OF THE GARDEN: BUT OF THE FRUIT OF THE TREE WHICH IS IN THE MIDST OF THE GARDEN, GOD HATH SAID, YE SHALL NOT EAT OF IT, NEITHER SHALL YE TOUCH IT, LEST YE DIE-Gen 3:2,3. Note confusion, as to what God had said, seems to be setting in. In her thoughts, she must have begun to question God’s Word. Eve had said certain words which God had not said, such as, NEITHER SHALL YE TOUCH IT. Her response to the serpent was a general impression of what she believed God had said, rather than God’s exact words. It may also be noted that she said, YE SHALL NOT EAT OF IT,...LEST YE DIE. God had said, THOU SHALT SURELY DIE. Her reply, LEST YE DIE, does not seem to carry the force that God’s Word had carried. Her way of replying may indicate that her belief and trust in God and His Word was like a wave; however, she did fear God’s judgment. Thus, if Satan is to be successful in causing her to disobey God, he needs to eliminate the fear of God’s judgment, which is death. Satan had won the first round.
AND THE SERPENT SAID UNTO THE WOMAN, YE SHALL NOT SURELY DIE-Gen 3:4. God had said, THOU SHALT SURELY DIE. Surely, God would not cause her to die, for simply eating of the fruit of one particular tree. Satan’s words, YE SHALL NOT, carries with it a certain amount of force. Satan is directly contradicting God’s Word and undermining the concept of God’s absolute authority. Satan is scoffing God’s authority. He seems to be suggesting that the woman is confined by her position of believing and trusting in God’s Word. "YE SHALL NOT SURELY DIE", is the same lie that he puts in our thoughts today. Satan puts in our thoughts that we will not perish, and that hell is only for bad people. He puts in our thoughts that we are a pretty good person, and therefore, God will surely let us into heaven. Satan may tell us that there is no such place as hell, or the lake of fire; and if there was, surely, a good, loving, and merciful God would never send us there. Satan may tell us that the idea of eternal punishment is just not true. The devil may tell us that it is all right to disobey God. It is all right to sin. It is all right to live any way we want. The devil may tell us we do not have to repent of all sin. We do not need to read the Bible. We do not need to hear and obey the Gospel. We do not need to go to church. Satan may tell us in our thoughts that we will never have to give an account for our sin. We will never have to face the judgment of a Holy God. We do not have to worry. God will never let us perish to the lake of fire. Through this, she must have begun to question God’s Word.
Here is the conflict. It is between the truth of God’s Word, and the lies Satan puts in our thoughts. It is between the truth of God’s Word, and our emotions. It is between the truth of God’s Word, and our fleshly desires. We are in a battle between the TRUTH of God’s Word, and the lies of the devil. There is a battle going on in our thoughts between the truth of God’s Word, and the traditions of men, pastors, churches, denominations, and our own wrong thinking. Satan is a master at confusing us, deceiving us, and causing us to doubt. It is written, THE DEVIL...IS A LIAR, AND THE FATHER OF IT-Jn 8:44. In telling the woman that YE SHALL NOT SURELY DIE, the serpent is also insinuating that God lied to her.
The serpent had first planted doubt and confusion in the woman’s mind. Now, by directly contradicting God’s Word of truth, he was attempting to remove the fear of God’s judgment, which was, THOU SHALT SURELY DIE. The woman was going to have to choose which voice she would believe. She was going to have to choose whether she would put her faith in the words of the Lord God, or put her faith in the words of the serpent. We are faced with this same choice. Will we put our faith in the Word of God (the Bible), or will we put our faith in the wrong thoughts we have in our mind, or hear from blind teachers or other people? If the woman chooses to believe the serpent’s words, rather than God’s Word, he will have succeeded. Thus, the serpent realized he needed to do more, than just contradict God’s Word. He had to persuade the woman in other ways also.
Next the serpent will attempt to explain to her why God lied. Satan is also called the ACCUSER-ref Rev 12:10. He accuses the brethren, and he accuses God. The serpent then said, FOR GOD DOTH KNOW THAT IN THE DAY YE EAT THEREOF, THEN YOUR EYES SHALL BE OPENED, AND YE SHALL BE AS GODS, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL-Gen 3:5. Note Satan’s words, FOR GOD DOTH KNOW. This gives the impression that it is all right in the eyes of God, and that God misled her for these reasons.
Satan then told her, THAT IN THE DAY YE EAT THEREOF. It appears the serpent is trying to cause her to disobey God sooner, rather than later.
Then he continued by saying, THEN YOUR EYES SHALL BE OPENED. The serpent is arousing her curiosity. He is tempting her by trying to make her believe there is something very good and special that will happen to her if she would just eat of the fruit, and disobey God. She must have wondered what it might mean that her eyes would be opened.
Then Satan continued with the words, AND YE SHALL BE AS GODS. What a wonderful promise the serpent was giving her, YE SHALL BE AS GODS. To be a god is to be able to do whatever you want, and to give account to no one. To be a god is to be something special, to control your own destiny, and certainly it is something many people want today. It is a form of preaching that abounds today in many churches.
Then the serpent adds these words, KNOWING GOOD AND EVIL. Satan was telling the woman that the path to knowledge is to bypass God’s Word. The woman must have wondered, "What is good and evil?" Indeed, if she would disobey God and do as the devil was tempting her to do, she would know and understand GOOD AND EVIL. She would also die, even though Satan had assured her that she would not die. Satan’s very clever and deceitful words which were filled with half truths and lies, were having an effect on the woman. The fear of God’s judgment had been eliminated. Now she was being tempted with things that could be greatly desired. She must have wondered since God knew all this anyway, "Surely, it must be all right."
The serpent had used only about 46 words which changed the history of the world. Do not underestimate your enemy, the devil. Satan knows just what thoughts to put in our mind to tempt us. These thoughts are just what our heart wants to hear. It is written, SATAN! YOU...HAVE IN MIND...THE THINGS OF MEN-Mt 16:23 NIV.
Now the lusts of the flesh come into play. Food can be a great temptation. The lusts and desires of the flesh and of our eyes can be a great temptation. Also, if we believe there is nothing wrong with doing something, then why not do it? Satan may tell us in our thoughts, "If it feels all right, then it must be all right."
item two-THAT IT WAS PLEASANT (or pleasing) TO THE EYES. The lusts of the eyes began to prompt her to sin. Sight can be a pathway to lead us to sin.
item three-She saw that the TREE WAS GOOD FOR FOOD. The lusts of the flesh begin to prompt her to disobey God. Food can be a pathway to lead us to sin. Satan tempted Jesus regarding food.
Desire can lead to covetousness which is sin. The idea that we can’t have something may make us to want it even more. The woman’s fleshly desires must have elevated. Her ungodly desires were prompting her to sin. She began to desire and covet the fruit. God’s Word warns us about being covetous. Indeed, the eyes of man never seem to be satisfied-ref Pv 27:20. She had the magnificent Garden of Eden to dwell in. She could eat of every tree of the garden, but it wasn’t enough. She did not seem to be thankful for all that she had. She wanted more. We might consider, Ro 1:21,24-BECAUSE THAT, WHEN THEY KNEW GOD, THEY GLORIFIED HIM NOT AS GOD, NEITHER WERE THANKFUL; BUT BECAME VAIN (or futile) IN THEIR IMAGINATIONS (or thinking), AND THEIR FOOLISH HEART WAS DARKENED. The serpent caused her to look at what she did not have, rather than what she did have.
The fear of God’s judgment had been eliminated. She was no longer afraid of the judgment of death. She also realized that there should be great benefits in eating this particular fruit. As it might be said by the devil, "There is nothing to lose, and everything to gain." It is written: THERE IS A WAY WHICH SEEMETH RIGHT UNTO A MAN, BUT THE END THEREOF ARE THE WAYS OF DEATH-Pv 14:12. It seemed right to the woman to eat of the fruit.
It may be that the woman was now so stirred up about eating the forbidden fruit, that she ran to the tree to eat. So the woman, SHE TOOK OF THE FRUIT THEREOF, AND DID EAT-Gen 3:6. SHE TOOK. SHE...DID EAT. The woman: she saw, she desired, she took, and then she ate. The woman had sinned. She had disobeyed God. AND ADAM WAS NOT DECEIVED, BUT THE WOMAN BEING DECEIVED WAS IN THE TRANSGRESSION-l Tim 2:14. Yet at this point, she did not yet seem to be conscious that she had done wrong.
She now wants her husband to share in what she considered to be her good fortune, but was really a wicked sin. Many times we may do something wrong, and then we want to get other people involved also. We want other people to see it "our" way. AND (she) GAVE ALSO UNTO HER HUSBAND WITH HER; AND HE DID EAT-Gen 3:6. Adam had become the follower of his wife, rather than a follower of the Lord God. Adam, who was the leader, became the follower of the woman. It seemed right to Adam to follow his wife’s word, rather than God’s Word.
Sin had now entered into the world. Adam (the man) from which the blood line comes, had sinned. WHEREFORE, AS BY ONE MAN SIN ENTERED INTO THE WORLD, AND DEATH BY SIN; AND SO DEATH PASSED UPON ALL MEN, FOR THAT ALL HAVE SINNED-Ro 5:12. THEREFORE AS BY THE OFFENSE OF ONE JUDGMENT CAME UPON ALL MEN TO CONDEMNATION...FOR AS BY ONE MAN’S DISOBEDIENCE MANY WERE MADE SINNERS-Ro 5:18,19.
AND THE EYES OF THEM BOTH WERE OPENED, AND THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE NAKED; AND THEY SEWED FIG LEAVES TOGETHER, AND MADE THEMSELVES APRONS (or coverings)-Gen 3:7. Now they realized that God meant what He said, but it was too late. The serpent had very skillfully beguiled, confused, and deceived the woman. He had used a combination of half truths and lies. Satan had told her what her heart wanted to hear. Satan knows how to put in our thoughts just what we want to hear. Then her own desires had overcome her, and she disobeyed God. Then Adam obeyed his wife, rather than God. He also ate of the fruit, and disobeyed God. AND THE EYES OF THEM BOTH WERE OPENED. They now understood good and evil. They now saw things differently than they had before. Soon they would understand judgment and the consequences of sin, FOR THE WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH-Ro 6:23.
THEY KNEW…THEY WERE NAKED. They now understood things that they did not understand before. Sin makes us naked, and NAKEDNESS is a shame (or shameful)-ref Rev 3:18. They now wanted to cover or hide their shame, their nakedness, their sin.
THEY SEWED FIG LEAVES TOGETHER, AND MADE THEMSELVES APRONS (coverings). The fig leaves are man’s attempt to save himself by a bloodless religion of good works. Fig leaves cannot cleanse us or wash us from our sins. Fig leaves cannot cover the shame of our nakedness. People often try to hide their sins. It is written, IF I HAVE CONCEALED MY SIN AS MEN DO, BY HIDING MY GUILT IN MY HEART BECAUSE I SO FEARED THE CROWD AND SO DREADED THE CONTEMPT OF THE CLANS THAT I KEPT SILENT AND WOULD NOT GO OUTSIDE-Job 31:33,34 NIV. Many people today attempt to cover their sin and nakedness in a variety ways. They may do this by performing good works, or following a certain denomination. Some may try to cover their shame by preaching in pulpits, or auditoriums, or even on the mission field. Their preaching consists of words and stories of men, with very little of the Word of God. They have TURNED TO MEANINGLESS TALK. THEY WANT TO BE TEACHERS OF THE LAW (or Bible), BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT-ref 1 Tim 1:6,7 NIV. They do not understand that they do not know what they are talking about BECAUSE THE DARKNESS they are walking in HAS BLINDED their eyes--ref l Jn 2:11 NIV. Some try to cover their nakedness by going to church, and singing in the choir, or teaching a Sunday school. What better place to ease the conscience from sin than behind a pulpit, or in a lukewarm church that does not preach on sin, and judgment, and eternal damnation. Some try to cover their nakedness by giving money to their church or charitable organizations, or even getting involved in worldly causes that seem good and right. They may have the praise of men, but they will perish to hell.
Many people today refuse to admit they sin or do wrong. They do not even know they are naked. Their covering is deceit. Their CONSCIENCES HAVE BEEN SEARED AS WITH A HOT IRON-1 Tim 4:2 NIV. They are like trees walking about without understanding-ref Mk 8:24. They do not understand God’s Word. Adam’s intimate relationship with God was broken. Billions of graves testify that when God said, THOU SHALT SURELY DIE, He meant exactly what He said. Indeed, these graves are proof that God’s Word is true.
The man and woman covered their nakedness from each other, and then hid from the Lord God. And from that time, even until now, people continue to speak and do evil and hope that no one will find out. They continue to try to hide their evil doings from others and from God.
They were afraid. Adam did not want his nakedness exposed. He did not want his sin exposed. As it is written, IF I COVERED MY TRANSGRESSIONS AS ADAM, BY HIDING MINE INIQUITY IN MY BOSOM (or heart)-Job 31:33. Judgment was about to come upon them, and they did not want to face it. Sin causes us to be more concerned with what happens to us, than the fact that we disobeyed God. Sin can cause us to be more concerned with our appearance and what people think about us, than the fact that we have sinned against a Holy God. Adam was more aware of his nakedness, than the fact he had disobeyed the Lord God. Adam seemed more concerned with the consequences of what he had done, than with the sin he had committed. Sin seeks a refuge in hiding, in evasion, in half truths, lying, and deceit. Our flesh wants to sin, and do those things which are pleasing to our worldly nature, but we don’t want to pay the price for what we do. Why should Adam and the woman have been afraid when they were naked? Their nakedness revealed their transgression. We need to understand, IT IS APPOINTED UNTO MEN ONCE TO DIE, BUT AFTER THIS THE JUDGMENT-Heb 9:27. By hiding, did they think they would somehow escape the judgment of God? Did they think God would not find them and that He would just go away and forget that they had sinned? Did they think that God had forgotten the words He had spoken? Satan puts in the minds of many people today that they will never be called to the judgment and that it will all turn out all right. Remember, there is a battle going on in our thoughts, between the TRUTH of God’s Word and the deceiving lies and half truths of the devil.
AND THIS IS THE CONDEMNATION, THAT LIGHT (Jesus) IS COME INTO THE WORLD, AND MEN "LOVED" DARKNESS RATHER THAN LIGHT, "BECAUSE" THEIR DEEDS WERE EVIL. FOR EVERY ONE THAT '"DOETH" EVIL HATETH THE LIGHT (Jesus), NEITHER COMETH TO THE LIGHT (to Jesus), LEST HIS DEEDS (what he does) SHOULD BE REPROVED. (The person that does evil will not come to Jesus, for fear that what he does will be exposed and made known). BUT HE THAT DOETH TRUTH COMETH TO THE LIGHT, THAT HIS DEEDS MAY BE MADE MANIFEST (or made known or plainly seen), THAT THEY ARE WROUGHT IN GOD-Jn 3:19-21. Adam and the woman hid. They were afraid.
Adam should have run to God and confessed his sin and sought for mercy, but he did not. He made an excuse. He blamed the woman. How hard it is for man to be open and transparent and blame no one, but himself.

Even as the darkness from the Void casts its shadow across Urth, there are other dangers found lurking in the gloamings of the world. Some perils seek to entrap the innocent. Some are never defeated, their evils only delayed for a time. And at least one hungers for blood and meat to sustain its immortality. Tonight, this horror sets out to feed its vile hunger with fresh flesh.
A love letter to every story about holding down a bad position against even worse people, whether the attackers are human or not quite, Dead by Dawn is an adventure written for a group of three to five starting characters. In it, the player characters must find a way to survive an onslaught of undead, driven by a malevolent nature spirit to attack a nearby inn. The characters just have to survive until sunrise.
Last night, we took a break from my Tamoachan DnD 5E game so that I could run a Halloween game. I chose to run Schwalb Entertainment's Dead By Dawn adventure written by Rob Wieland for Shadow of the Demon Lord. The adventure comes in at 6 pages [...]
These products were created by scanning an original printed edition. Most older books are in scanned image format because original digital layout files never existed or were no longer available from the publisher.
For PDF download editions, each page has been run through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software to attempt to decipher the printed text. The result of this OCR process is placed invisibly behind the picture of each scanned page, to allow for text searching. However, any text in a given book set on a graphical background or in handwritten fonts would most likely not be picked up by the OCR software, and is therefore not searchable. Also, a few larger books may be resampled to fit into the system, and may not have this searchable text background.
For printed books, we have performed high-resolution scans of an original hardcopy of the book. We essentially digitally re-master the book. Unfortunately, the resulting quality of these books is not as high. It's the problem of making a copy of a copy. The text is fine for reading, but illustration work starts to run dark, pixellating and/or losing shades of grey. Moiré patterns may develop in photos. We mark clearly which print titles come from scanned image books so that you can make an informed purchase decision about the quality of what you will receive.
These ebooks were created from the original electronic layout files, and therefore are fully text searchable. Also, their file size tends to be smaller than scanned image books. Most newer books are in the original electronic format. Both download and print editions of such books should be high quality.

When I met Richard he was a public defender with a case load to the moon and back. I always had questions about my case and I had 4 public defenders prior to getting Richard appointed to my case. I could always get in touch with him and he would always contact me to keep me updated. Sometimes we would talk about the case late at night such as 9-10 pm, because he was still in his office working. His work ethic is by far second to none, when you think about a public defender working that hard for his clients it’s unbelievable. For some reason Richard was parting ways with the public defender’s office, so I called him and hired him to represent me in a serious DUI case. Let me tell you right now……..that was the best move I’ve ever made. If you find yourself needing council you would be a fool to pass up on Richard Mercure.
We proudly serve Gainesville and many of the surrounding counties, but frequently accept cases originating in Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Tampa, and Orlando. If you are located in one of these areas, just give us a call for a free over-the-phone consultation!
There aren’t words that can truly explain the work ethic Rick has for his clients. Rick was my lawyer last year and fought tooth and nail to make sure I received the best possible outcome for my case and I did. I trust this man with my life and to this day he remains my lawyer. There was never a second that I had to second guess his judgment because he was always informative and confident. I recommend him to my closest friends and my family and he is there for us any second of the day. I thank God every single day I met Rick and if you choose him as your council you will too.

Words cannot explain what a remarkable attorney he is. During one of the most stressful times in my life, Attorney Rick Mercure was my guiding light. I have never met an attorney that cared so much for their clients. Not only is he an EXCELLENT attorney, I consider him a great friend for what he has done for me and my family. Without going into details about the case, I just want everyone to know that the result he got on my case was better than I ever expected. All the reviews written about him are correct…he is trustworthy, honest, ethical, hard-working, and can be reached at all times. Not once did he fail to respond back to me when I called, text, or emailed him. He truly was a God send to me.

In 2012 I chose to be represented by the public defender’s office after I was charged in Gainesville, Florida. After three replacements, I was finally represented by Rick Mercure. This case was lengthy because the previous attorneys who had represented me was re-assigned to different divisions. Mr. Mercure was remarkable in keeping me informed in the progress of my case. He broke down every event for me and made sure I knew what I was facing.
Once we went to trial, Mr. Mercure definitely displayed his knowledge of the laws, court room etiquette, and argument strategy. Needless to say, Mr. Mercure won my case that day. I had a lot riding during that trial and I truly believe if Mr. Mercure hadn’t represented me then I’d be in jail for a crime that I was not guilty of.

When I made one the dumbest decisions in my life, I was left thrown into a public system with lawyers who could care less. After being tossed between two public defenders I finally lucked out and my case was assigned to Rick. We already had an offer of reckless driving but after watching the video and sitting with him he looked at me and said “If you want to take this to trial I’ll be right by your side and I know we have a good case.”. I was so happy because before that moment I thought I would be stuck with another suit who wanted to close a file and move on. Not the case, Rick put the work in and eventually got the State to drop all charges! Look, I don’t know how else to put this, if you have made the mistake of driving under the influence and your scared that no one cares enough to help and get results? Call Rick. I’m a kid from the other side of the tracks and he really looked out for me. No DUI, community service, fines, probation. Nothing. He is a great guy and he actually cares enough about being a great lawyer to understand that his clients are what are important.

Rick is an amazing attorney, best in my opinion! I had a previous attorney on my case drop the ball. I found Rick and he turned the situation around. He keeps true to his word,he’s honest, and personable. Rick was always one step ahead. I’d call him with a question or concern and he’d already spoken to the opposition. He always kept me informed whether by text, call, or email. I never even got to meet Rick, my case was in a different county than where I was residing and I still feel like he went above and beyond! I was living in North Carolina and forced to stay in Florida to complete my probation. Rick changed my life. He got me home and I can’t thank him enough! I had lost confidence in legal advice, but Rick turned that around. I trust Rick with my life, if you need a Florida attorney he’s your guy! Thank you so much for everything Rick!:)

No doubt about which show will pack in the crowds in Paris this season – René Magritte at the Pompidou can count on a large fan base that goes beyond the cognoscenti. As can Oscar Wilde, whose personal effects will be on show at the Petit Palais, while there should be a riot of colour at the Grand Palais, where Mexican muralists, and currently trendy Frida Kahlo, are on show.
René Magritte, the Treason of Images. Centre Pompidou, 21 September 2016 - 23 January 2017. The French used to make jokes about the Belgians being a bit thick. Nowadays the media prefers to portray them as lovable eccentrics. Magritte fits the bill with his surrealist images of bowler-hatted men raining from the sky, a man seeing the back of his own head in a mirror and a pipe that is declared not to be a pipe. The Pompidou promises an “unprecedented” approach to his work with famous and less well-known paintings on show.
Oscar Wilde, Insolence Incarnate, Petit Palais, 28 September 2016 – 15 January 2017 should also prove popular, if the number of fans who flock to his grave in Père Lachaise cemetery is anything to go by. Wilde was an “ardent Francophile” and fluent French-speaker, the blurb informs us. He died in a cheap Paris hotel room after serving prison time for homosexuality in Britain. We will be able to see 200 manuscripts, photographs, paintings, drawings, caricatures and personal effects in an exhibition that hopes to make up for the fact that Paris omitted to mark the centenary of his death in 2000.
Mexique 1900-1950, Grand Palais, 5 October 2016 – 23 January 2017. Following independence from Spain in 1821 and a series of wars and revolutions, Mexico became the home of a vibrant school of mural painters. Diego Rivera was the giant of the movement but Jose Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siquieros were also major painters. Although all left-wing, they differed, at least temporarily, in their politics, Rivera welcoming Leon Trotsky to the country, while Siquieros tried to assassinate him, a task which Ramon Mercador later succeeded in carrying out. The work of Rivera’s wife, Frida Kahlo, who also enjoyed warm relations with the Russian anti-Stalinist, is now more fashionable than her husband’s and will feature in the show ... Plus another Belgian, Georges Prosper Remi, better-known by his pen-name Hergé, the creator of Tintin. Not clear how he would have cohabited with the Mexicans in real life, however. He was a fervent royalist and published in the Nazi-controlled Le Soir German occupation, leading to his being blacklisted after the end of under the World War II. More recently some of his works, notably Tintin in the Congo, have been accused of racism. None of this has dented his popularity, witness the 373 million dollars grossed by the 2011 film The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn show, so expect to have to use your elbows to get a good view of the works.
The Color Line, Musée du Quai Branly, 4 October 2016 – 15 January 2017. Speaking of racism … Paris’s non-European art museum pays tribute to African-American artists working in a time of segregation “during a century and a half-long struggle, to blurring this discriminatory ‘color line’." WEB Dubois, the Harlem Renaissance, Booker T Washington, Frederick Douglass and Billie Holiday all get a name check.
Picasso – Giacometti, Dialogue between two masters, Musée Picasso, 4 October 2016 – 5 February 2017. Not many people know this, the Picasso museum claims, but, despite a 20-year age gap and different personalities, the two artists had a “both friendly and formal” relationship, sharing a fascination with Eros and Thanatos (sex and death). The revamped museum has teamed up with the Giacometti foundation to prove its point.
The Spectacular Second Empire, 1852-1870, Musée d’Orsay, 27 September 2016 - 15 January 2017. Back to the 19th century at the Musée d’Orsay, which takes a look at France’s Second Empire, when Napoleon III ran a quasi-monarchical but thoroughly bourgeois regime. The epoch was mocked for its “decadence and superficiality” after it fell, the museum tells us, but maybe the conspicuous spending against a background of social unrest are in tune with our celebrity-dominated times, because the Orsay finds the “ostentation and numerous lavish celebrations” are “worth revisiting” ... Plus Frédéric Bazille (1841-1870). The Youth of Impressionism. 15 November 2016 - 5 March 2017, displays 60 paintings by the proto-impressionist and friend of Claude Monet who was killed in action during the Franco-Prussian war.
Fantin-Latour, Musée du Luxembourg, 14 September – 12 February 2017. Staying in the 19th century, Henri Fantin-Latour (1836-1904) is honoured with his first major exhibition since 1982. Another friend of the impressionists, he gained fame in Britain for his still lifes thanks to American painter and Francophile, James McNeill Whistler. The show promises self-portraits, portraits of his sisters and other homey stuff.
Rembrandt in Confidence, Musée Jacquemart-André, 16 September 2016 – 23 January 2017. The Dutch master’s self-portraits, and pictures of his wife, his mistress and his son are among the great triumphs of Western art, although the paintings the Jacquemart-André actually owns - the Pilgrims at Emmaus (1629), the Portrait of Princess Amalia van Solms (1632), and the Portrait of Doctor Arnold Tholinx (1656) - don’t really fall into the domestic category. With the help of some 50 loaned works, the museum promises to relate them to different phases of Rembrandt’s career and says you will gain a “better understanding of his artistic practices as well as his biography”.
Bouchardon, an idea of beauty, the Louvre, 14 September – 5 December. In collaboration with the Los Angeles Getty, the Louvre presents the first major show of work by a neoclassical sculptor and draughtsman who was famous in his time - the 18th century. Less so today, though. Maybe the Louvre will change that.
Fiac, Grand Palais, Petit Palais, Champs Elysées, 20 October 2016 – 23 October 2016. Get bang up to date with Paris’s annual art fair, which spills out of the galleries onto the streets, where 186 art dealers show their wares in tents along the Champs Elysées and other nearby locations. Don’t forget your credit card!
Icons of Modern Art, the Shchukin collection, Fondation Louis Vuitton, 22 October 2016 – 20 February 2017.

Gyosan are stylish flip-flops “MADE IN JAPAN”. Gyosan have been very popular among Japanese youth since the year 2000. Originally, Gyosan were local sandals worn in Ogasawara islands because their durability and anti-slip effect were loved by local fishermen. Around 2000, Gyosan gained popularity in mainland Japan developing the variety of colors and styles. Gyosan won the favor of Scuba Divers, Surfers, Fishermen, and Hula-dancers. Some celebrities introduced Gyosan as their fashionable footwear, and their reputation spread nationwide.
Engraved brand mark of “PEARL” guarantees the quality of “MADE IN JAPAN”. PEARL is the authentic manufacturer of GYOSAN.
Gyosan is made of single-piece. There is NO joint between sole and thong. The durability is second to none. That’s why so many professionals love Gyosan.
The secret of Gyosan’s Anti-slip effect lies in its cutting. The technical cutting* grip the slippery ground. You will not slip anymore on wet floor, deck board and rocky shore. (*There are two types of cutting depending on the styles.)
In 2009, Satoshi Ohno, the leader of the most popular Japanese idol group “ARASHI”, introduced GYOSAN in the famous TV show. That became the breakthrough for GYOSAN.
Mr. Ohno is well known as a fishing lover. He became fond of GYOSAN personally, and introduced GYOSAN in a famous TV show not only as the fisherman’s sandal, but as the stylish casual footwear.(left) The feedback was immense. Even during the program was still on the air, the phone call for order kept on ringing. The color he wore was sold out in a minute.
In the other show, Mr. Ohno introduced his original style to wear different colors on each foot.(right) Many fans of ARASHI rushed to get GYOSAN, and followed his style.
Mr. Ohno wears GYOSAN even during the concert of ARASHI. GYOSAN is one of the well-known items among fans of ARASHI.
The Big Wave of GYOSAN caused by Mr. Ohno overwhelmed over Japan. And the Big Wave is coming out of JAPAN!!!

For the Made in Québec project, the artist went to China, positioning herself as a commodity, working with Chinese workers in a Chinese milieu. This act can be interpreted as a way of giving back some of the time that Chinese products save Western consumers. Shot in diverse work settings, these photographs highlight the context in which the artist found herself, lending a human dimension to the abstract relationship that we have with production and consumption, our relationship with the products we buy often being limited to the words written on the labels.

The Canadian environmental sector is impressively large, employing more Canadians than both the country’s aerospace and pharmaceutical sectors. In addition, Canadian policy-makers have placed a renewed emphasis on this sector with global public sentiment on environment and climate change continually increasing. These shifting dynamics are continuously creating new opportunities for industries operating in this arena.
However, the environmental sector is complex.

The piece called "The Financial Crisis White Paper" is excellent. For anyone wishing to deepen their understanding of the roots and possible solutions to our economic crisis, I commend this to their attention.
Not to brag or anything, but the other Delawarean entry beat the white paper by a factor of 50 to one... unfortunate to all, none of the judges went beyond the table of contents, so alas, it got nary a vote.
Also my response to your queries on Battlestar Galactica were hung up in moderation underneath your post nominating this Week's Watchers of Weasels. Doubt if it's still there.. but just sayin'....

... the teacher who came to my room that late 1994 afternoon and asked if I wanted a Charlie Oberly yard sign for my house. "Why?" I asked. "I'm voting for Bill Roth." (Oberly was the Democrat going up against the long-time GOP incumbent senator.)
Unfortunately, too many teachers are liberal Democrats, and seem to automatically feel that all their colleagues are too. Oops.
In a close election race against former Hewlett-Packard executive Carly Fiorina, California Democrat Sen. Barbara Boxer is facing new ethics complaints over asking teachers to send their students to work for her campaign.
In an Oct. 27 letter to California education authorities, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association (HJTA), a non-profit group urging lower taxes, said, “In abject ignorance of California state law, the political campaign of Senator Barbara Boxer has openly solicited teachers employed by [Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD)] to urge their students to volunteer for her campaign.”

As a father of three and Assistant Scoutmaster to Chapin’s Troop 411 of the Boy Scouts of America, Furman Miller is no stranger to the outdoors. Trekking though various parts of South Carolina with his boys, he has visited areas of our State many people never get to see. After following the expansion of the Palmetto Trail, Furman decided to take action and contacted Palmetto Conservation Foundation (PCF) to see how his Troop could get involved and help give others a chance to experience nature in the Palmetto State.
PCF is a statewide organization dedicated to conserving South Carolina’s natural and cultural resources, preserving historic landmarks, and promoting outdoor recreation through trails and greenways, including the Palmetto Trail. Founded in 1989, the organization helps communities throughout our state grow and prosper while maintaining local character and quality of life. PCF familiarizes visitors and residents with the natural adventures the Palmetto State has to offer by hosting educational programs and activities that encourage people to explore nature and learn new outdoor skills.
Through PCF, Furman’s Troop adopted an 11.5-mile section of the Palmetto Trail known as the Peak to Prosperity Passage. The boys worked hard to open the passage, converting leftover train trestles and using tractors and chainsaws to clear the pathway. The Troop now maintains it by mowing, removing low-hanging branches, mulching rocky areas, and replacing worn decking on trestles. “We love the outdoors anyway and this is an opportunity to get out and give back to the community,” Furman said. “We provide a resource for people to use, and get so much positive feedback from those who walk the Trail.”
In addition to the upkeep of their adopted passage, the Troop dedicates time to improving other sections of the Palmetto Trail. Currently, the Troop is helping to open new passages as part of a statewide effort to expand the Trail continuously across South Carolina. The boys have cleared areas for primitive campsites, installed bat boxes, constructed stairways and overlooks, created parking areas, and more. They have also helped highlight associated history along the Trail by marking sites of significance, as many sections predate the Civil War.
“The Palmetto Trail is a great concept and a wonderful resource,” Furman said. “It allows residents and visitors alike to explore our State and see all of its different environments from coast to mountains. By making the Trail accessible and offering programs for people to learn new things, PCF exposes the natural beauty of South Carolina.”
Furman feels PCF has not only opened up opportunities for his Troop to get more involved, but also offers others a chance to experience all that nature has to offer. “PCF gives a lot to the community by organizing different events that get people outside to enjoy nature while improving their health,” Furman said. “What they do is valuable for people’s mental state and their physical well being.”
Furman and his Troop look forward to continuing to work with PCF to improve and expand the Palmetto Trail. “I am really proud of my State and this is a great way to showcase parts of it,” he said. “I’m eager to see the day we’re able to make it continuous from mountains to sea with no gaps.”

Inhambane Gitonga Project: An upcoming issue of SDLP will compile grammatical descriptions of several aspects of Gitonga. I am a contributor and editor.
This project aims to provide a description and analysis of the stress and tone of the variety of Mixtec spoken by the diaspora community in San Diego from Ixpantepec Nieves, Oaxaca, as well as to produce quantitative documentation of the acoustic correlates of these sound patterns.
This work is supported by a UC MEXUS Dissertation Research Grant, and the research is one aspect of a more general collaboration with the Mixtec community in San Diego.
My primary effort in the Gitonga project was towards describing the pitch lowering that occurs in the final two syllables of utterances and the vowel lengthening that appears in the penultimate syllable of utterances and (to a lesser extent) prosodic phrases. Here is a poster about it.

Jinhua Wu is a Chinese dialect spoken in central Zhejiang Province. The area is known for high regional variation and complicated tonal phonology. This study documented generational differences in the sandhi tones, showing that the tone contours changed in a way consistent with a temporal shift within the syllable, even while the tone categories stayed fairly consistent.
Similarities among the sandhi systems of 15 speakers of Jinhua Wu, showing generational differences (blue vs. red boundaries) along dimension 1, and location differences (blue vs. yellow interiors) along dimension 3.

Finding relief from pain either temporary or longer lasting has always been a problem for many of us but today there is a possible solution which can bring many of us the relief we need at a cost which is reasonable. The relief which is available today comes from CBD pain relief cream and more can be discovered about this product from the website https://americancbd.com/product/cbd-muscle-pain-relief-cream/. This is a product which makes use of the CBD found in the hemp plant which previously, due to its being banned, was not available. Other names for hemp are of course cannabis or marijuana and as such the growing of hemp or the use of it for any purpose was banned in the US plus most of the other countries in the world. Today, however, some countries and states within the US are legalizing hemp for medicinal purposes and this now makes CBD widely available for use in creams and other products to bring sufferers relief from pain. CBD is a form of cannabinoid, many of which are found in the hemp plant, including the cannabinoids which are responsible for ‘highs’ and addiction. It is now possible to recognize and separate the good cannabinoids from the bad ones which contain THC, the actual substance which causes a ‘high’. This means that not only can scientists separate the cannabinoids but they can also now grow strains of hemp with lower THC levels, making more of the plant useable for beneficial purposes. Hemp was banned first by the US and then the rest of the world in the mid 20thcentury but has always been criticized as the ban meant losing beneficial properties the plant had to offer as well as the harmful ones. Today many countries are reviewing their bans on the plant and some, including some of the US States, are now allowing the plant to be used for medicinal purposes, a decision which is being greatly appreciated by many people suffering from chronic pain. The full health benefits of which hemp can provide are not yet known but already many products are being introduced which have beneficial medical properties including ones which help with Alzheimer’s, arthritis and even cancer. As the use of hemp for medicinal purposes becomes more acceptable to authorities who had previously banned them, its use will not only become more popular for pain relief but also more predominant in the health industry overall, assisting with many ailments and treatments. Some have said that hemp is perhaps the most useful of plants as not only does it have the potential to produce untold medical benefits but also can help reduce global warming as bulk can replace paper in many products. One of the main advantages of using hemp in medicines and in replacing paper is that it is easily cultivated and can be harvested twice annually whereas most plants can only be harvested once annually and of course trees take years to be replaced. It is good then that now hemp is being seen as more than just as the recreational drug marijuana.
Some people find it difficult to sleep for a number of reasons while others easily shut their eyes and stay unconscious for several hours. Several folks also fall asleep only to wake up in the middle of their slumber or wake up sweaty. If you’re one of those that have slumber issues then you shouldn’t delay and act on your situation as soon as possible. That’s because your problems may actually worsen when you’d deny their existence or ignore them. Besides, you’d make your life worthwhile when you’d get rid of troubles that can be dealt with. So how do you manage to get quality slumber, you ask? Whether you’ve got chemical imbalances in your brain that cause you to be deprived of sleep or have thoughts that repeatedly bother you, there are several solutions that can help you achieve hours of sleep that would let you wake up feeling vibrant. For some methods that could assist you in getting excellent slumber, please keep reading. If you believe that the cause of your sleep deprivation is your feelings of anxiety or depression then it may be time for you to look for things that you could consume to alter the hormones that are within your brain. If you’ve got your flight or flight response acting rapidly or have overwhelming feelings of sadness or hopelessness then you should try looking for a professional that can help you manage your thoughts and responses plus get you introduced to medications designed to handle different types of stress. To have appropriate assistance, you could try looking for a psychiatrist because the said type of physician is licensed to dispense and prescribe psychiatric drugs. But, if you’re not that ready to visit a psychiatric doctor but want to have access to something that can let you feel relaxed from having fear or feeling down, you could always go for things like the CBN Oil For Sleep because cannabis derivatives that won’t get you high are said to be safe for public use. But, before you decide to use any alternative or prescribed medication, you ought to consider buying from a reputable supplier and consuming where it would be legal for you to take some of what could help, It’s normal to be uncomfortable about taking in substances for stress relief or sleep issues because it is true that drugs and even dietary supplements still have to be processed by the body’s liver and other internal organs before they could be absorbed and a large portion of pills, capsules and even oils get discarded. If you’re interested in feeling at ease from being stressed out without the taking in anything by mouth or intravenously, you could always resort to seeking massage therapy. Basically, when you’d be massage, the alignment of the muscles of your body could be corrected and specific regions of your body could be stimulated which could get you to sleep for hours quickly.

Mimi and Lucky have a most unusual and unfortunate history, but it all started with good intentions. An older person was hoarding dogs, believing that she was saving them. Little by little, with intervention, they were brought to the Agoura shelter, all, that is, except Mimi and Lucky. For the past seven years, they have been living outdoors, sleeping on gravel with only an Igloo for protection from the elements. Miraculously, they have remained nice dogs, but more about that later.
Mimi is a 9-year-old female and Lucky, an 11-year-old male. They are both Chihuahuas who, believe it or not, have never lived inside a home or had a family or person to call their very own.
Worried about adopting an older dog? Don’t! Just like a puppy, they have the rest of their lives ahead of them. They both have been to see a private vet for their senior wellness check-up. During their visit, they also had their teeth cleaned. The vet said that they would need to be on a soft food diet for the rest of their lives but that they looked good otherwise. Lucky does have a luxating patella that sometimes causes him to lift his leg but the vet doesn’t feel it causes him much pain or that any treatment is needed. So they are ready to go!
There was concern that this bonded duo would not be able live indoors because of lack of training. A kind volunteer fostered them for a short time to see how they would do in a home.
Both are house trained, although Lucky did mark his territory a few times the first night but never again.

Once upon a time air travel was a great deal simpler than it is today. You called one of a few airlines that flew from your airport, the agent would tell you what flights were available for a given time, and you booked the one you wanted. Airports were always bustling places, especially during the holidays, but as long as you gave yourself adequate time, the process was usually the same. You would check your bags, go through the x-ray machine, get your boarding pass, and wait patiently at the appropriate gate. Once you got on the plane you ate the snack or meal that came with your flight and watched a movie.
In recent years travel by plane has become significantly more complicated. There are so many different configurations for flights and types of fares. Dire economic circumstances have caused airlines to raise rates and charge extra fees for everything from baggage to blankets. There are complex rules about what you can and cannot carry in your luggage. It can be very difficult to determine whether you are getting the best deal or the best services when you buy an airline ticket. The internet makes the navigation of airlines, airports, and flight itineraries easier, but, even so, be prepared to do some research if you want to find a flight at the best price.
Here is something up front that might save you time and money right off the bat. If you are traveling within the United States mainland, always look at Southwest Airlines first. Southwest is almost always the best deal you will find. However, Southwest itineraries do not appear on the major travel websites, so always go directly to the airline's website for information. Plug in your travel plans, and you will get a list of all the flights that are available. Southwest typically charges more reasonable prices than other airlines, and there are no hidden fees. The price you see is the price you get although tax and the government fee that is attached to all flights does apply. For lower prices than you can probably get anywhere else look at the "web only" fares, but keep in mind that these fares are not refundable.

Contact me on whatsapp I'm a quiet type of person, probably a bit shy at first as it has been a while, don't mind dining out but like to walk the beach, sunday drives a good cuddle up while watching dvd's.
Just looking around to broaden my knowledge in the bedroom fairly clean slate hoping to enjoy some new things out there.
After a harrowing two weeks of tests and examinations, I decided to treat myself to a trip down to Sephora! I had a birthday gift card to use up anyway. Surprisingly, I felt myself drawn to M.A.C more than other brand, and ended up picking three things!
I was searching high and low for the Benefit Pushup Liner but it was nowhere to be found! They had the display for it and everything but THE TESTER WAS NOT THERE. I was so frustrated!!! I was really psyched to play with it and actually see it in person. -okay rant over-
No matter, I picked up two M.A.C lipsticks, Ruby Woo and Chatterbox. Ruby Woo is a bright, cool-toned, vintage, 'perfect 50s' red. It is a retro matte finish and despite the fact that retro mattes are dryer than their regular mattes, I have been lusting after this for AGES and am so excited to finally get my hands on this. Chatterbox is a milky, neutral pink that is definitely brighter than your regular 'everyday' nudes like Creme Cup, for example. It is, however, not too bright or neon, and I think would work as lovely with a smokey eye as with a neutral look!
Their paint pot in Vintage Selection is another one that has been on my 'want' list since I first purchased my first one, Bare Study. It is a light, peachy-pink with a hint of brown and silver (or champagne? I can't really tell) frost. I think this would look perfect just by itself as well!
Everyone and their mother's pet cat has been raving about the Benfit Gimme Brow since its recent release. Usually I don't bother with such hyped-up products (ooh, look at me being all hipster) but my Catrice Brow Designer just was not cutting it for my messy brow hairs. I also hate faffing with eyebrows early in the morning as mine are the most tedious.
Overall, I'm really happy with my tiny haul and I really hope these products (especially the Gimme Brow) live up to the good reviews online!
Well I'm glad you've found something that works better for your brows! I'm not in need of much browing but some plucking and I like using brow powder and that's it! I would love to try a few mac lipsticks but currently still own none! They're double the price here but I will eventually decide on a shade to try! Lovely little haul you have!
I whip out the ol' brow powder occasionally too! My favourite is Joey Heely! Where do you live? I'm expecting your lips to look lush in the lustre/cremesheen finishes! Thank you!
Don't wait any longer! The reviews aren't kidding when they say Ruby Woo lasts all day! I had my three meals and it only faded a little on the inside of my lips and oh-so-gorgeous with winged liner! x

The Black Bull stands on the corner of Torcross Road and Victoria Road, just in to South Ruislip (where the Yeading Brook, 200 yards north of it, is the dividing line between Ruislip Manor and South Ruislip).
When the Ruislip Manor estate was built at the site of this pub stood a massive machine producing bricks or the mortar needed to build the houses locally. When the pub was built it was to be called the Brickmakers (Arms?) but for some reason ended up being the Black Bull, and it has been called this ever since.
Torcross Road, on the corner of which it stands, also had a name problem and was initially called Torbay Road, but this caused confusion with a road only half a mile away with the same name in Rayners Lane and so its name was changed.
Over the years the Black Bull has passed through many changes of ownership and each seems to have their own idea of what will make it make money, (at one time it had a reputation for food) and it has suffered from at least one suspicious fire.
The pub underwent a re-fit in mid 2002 and now has a large sun-deck to the side and reasonable sized garden to the rear. Most major sports events are shown on the big screen TV. (Footnote - due to a problem with planning the sun-deck was removed)
From Ruislip drive to Ruislip Manor and head down Victoria Road under the railway bridge. Leave Ruislip Manor going straight on at two roundabouts and the pub will be found on the left just as the road starts to climb a small hill. There is a reasonable sized car park in front of it, or street parking.
Good, the 114 bus stops right outside the door and 100 yards towards Ruislip Manor on the other side of the road, by the brook.
Not great. The pub stands about 1/2 mile from any other, but more or less equidistant from three. You could walk across the park opposite to Ruislip Gardens and The Bell, or left out of the pub on to Victoria Road and down to The Middlesex Arms, or right and up to Ruislip Manor, where there are four pubs. Allow around 20 mins for the walk to any of the above.
I popped in on a very hot Sunday lunch-time in the summer of 2013. The pub had recently been refurbished and looked very nice and a smell of new carpet lingered in the air. The pub is much as it was except that the area to the right of the bar has been knocked through where the (second) toilets were and this now is larger and has doors out to the garden. The bar location is unchanged and to the rear at the left of it is a pool table.
The pub has all around it flat screen TV sets and on the day I called in was showing Irish Hurling on TV, the sound was, er somewhat louder that it really needed to be and a small crowd were watching enthusiastically. I think this defines the market they are aiming for, this will become much as it was, a "local", they do not seem to be aiming for the "twin set and pearls" brigade!
I had a pint of Theakstons real ale, which was very nice, although nobody seemed to know which actual beer it was other than Theaksons brewed it.
My last sight of it (The Black Bull) was viewed through an alcoholic fog due to my rotten mates spiking my beer with everything from the top shelf. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton spent an evening drinking in the lounge bar with a mob of hangers on, in the early 60's. When it came time to leave, she led the way out through the saloon bar.

South of the Albera Range, Roses Bay forms a deep inlet in the coastline some 15 km long, with long sandy beaches and marshland. It is bounded by the Cap de Creus peninsula to the north and the Montgrí massif to the south.
Rhode and Emporion, located at either end of the bay, were the gateways through which Greek culture entered the country. Both have developed into major tourist resorts: Roses in the north and L’Escala to the south.
The origins of Roses date back the VIII century BC, with the arrival and establishment of the Rhodian, originating from the Greek island of Rhodes. Its name comes from this origins. Trade and the Roman occupation of this place have made a melting pot that explains the mood of a very modern, open, active and generous population.
Roses touristic points of interest are many and very different among them. Faced with the great natural landscapes that offer their creeks: Cala Montjoi, Cala Canyelles, Cala Jóncols, Cala Murtra, Cala Lledó, Cala Rustella, etc. you can also find cultural highlights of great interest as the route of the dolmens (dolmen Creu d'en Cobertella, Llit de la Generala, Cap de l'Home, Casa Cremada), also the Museum of Ciutadella (Citadel), the Castle of Santa Trinitat, Roses the Lighthouse and many other. Roses also has the largest fishing port in northern Costa Brava.
The cultural and musical offer of Roses is extensive and includes lectures, rock and blues festivals, exhibitions, concerts of various types of music and more. In summer the village hosts one of the major music festivals in the Costa Brava: Sons of Món (Sound of the World).
he best time to stroll by the harbour, one of the busiest on the Costa Brava, is in the evening, when the fishing boats sail in with their escort of gulls.
The terraces are an invitation to sit and chat, while the fortified precinct of the Ciutadella, built in the 16th century by Charles V to protect the region from pirates, merits a leisurely visit. Inside this vast fortress are the remains of the Greek colony of Rhode, founded in the 4th century BC, and the Benedictine Monastery of Santa Maria. All kinds of water sports can be practised at Roses, off the town’s own beaches of fine sand and in the coves of L’Almadrava, Montjoi and Jòncols.
If you are interested in nature walks and tours Roses offers well marked and accessible ones, through an exceptional nature resulting from the combination of sea and mountains.
The coast of Roses is full of contrasts. You'll find many cliffs overlooking the sea, but also quiet creeks with clear and shallow waters, soft sand, providing ideal conditions for practicing water sports like kayaking, fishing, sailing, windsurfing, paragliding, etc. For all these reasons, the family fun in this village at the foot of Cape Creus is guaranteed.
The name of Roses has been linked in recent years to the figure of the excellent chef Ferran Adrià, worldwide well-known for its innovative cuisine. Its famous restaurant, El Bulli, located in the idyllic Cala Montjoi, has become the El Bulli Foundation, a center of culinary research.
Santa Margarida and Empuriabrava are two large residential marinas built in the 1960s with navigable canals and an aerodrome, which is known internationally as a centre for parachute jumping. These tourist facilities – on land, sea and air – are in sharp contrast to the peace and quiet of the nearby wetlands.
Castelló d’Empúries, the chief town of Empordà in the Middle Ages, now combines its history, as the seat of an earldom, with a thriving agriculture.
With one of the largest municipal extensions of the Costa Brava, 33 km from Figueres and 70 km from Girona, el Port de la Selva offers a huge variety of landscapes: from the Mediterranean coast to the vineyards, and the rugged mountains to the foot of the Sierra de Rodes.
Cadaqués is the focal point of the Cap de Creus peninsula, which is an outstanding maritime and terrestrial natural park on account of the diversity of the marine species found there and the shapes of its rocks sculpted by the Tramuntana wind. All round the Cap de Creus, which faces over the Gulf of Lions, are inaccessible islets, cliffs and coves. Though the waters look calm, sea goers have nicknamed it “the Devil’s Cape” and it abounds in tales of shipwrecks and rescues.

The Mars Science Lander has a big ole laser on it and NASA says its for science. In real life, there was a secret mission to Mars that's gone rogue. The Cimmeria Advanced Traveler landed in the Terra Cimmeria area seven years ago to explore crater formations. The probe began ignoring commands, responding occasionally, if at all. Scientists have lost all contact and fear the missing probe may biologically contaminate the sandy Martian soil. Extreme measures must be taken. The purpose of the laser is obvious: Curiosity must hunt down and kill the CAT.
The modern man post (deleted the link, it was messing with my essay) at the NYT attracted a huge amount of comments, mostly fisking and criticism. The post itself almost seems to diverge on parody. Regardless, I've thought about it and have some comments to make. My comments are in bold. I've read some of the other criticisms, so my responses may line up with theirs.
1. When the modern man buys shoes for his spouse, he doesn’t have to ask her sister for the size. And he knows which brands run big or small.
2. The modern man never lets other people know when his confidence has sunk. He acts as if everything is going swimmingly until it is.
No one likes a moper, so I'd agree with this. If it's expensive or dangerous, a man lets people know when he's outside his area of expertise. "No, honey, I will not fix the leak in the shower. Faucets yes, showers are for the plumber."
3. The modern man is considerate. At the movie theater, he won’t munch down a mouthful of popcorn during a quiet moment. He waits for some ruckus.
Well, sure be considerate, but the example is lame. Surely keeping your cell phone off and your mouth shut is more important.
4. The modern man doesn’t cut the fatty or charred bits off his fillet. Every bite of steak is a privilege, and it all goes down the hatch.
5. The modern man won’t blow 10 minutes of his life looking for the best parking spot. He finds a reasonable one and puts his car between the lines.
6. Before the modern man heads off to bed, he makes sure his spouse’s phone and his kids’ electronic devices are charging for the night.
7. The modern man buys only regular colas, like Coke or Dr Pepper. If you walk into his house looking for a Mountain Dew, he’ll show you the door.
Buy whatever you like. Offer what you like to a guest. If they want something different, say you don't have any. If they want to BYOB, mostly fine. If you have a friend who becomes an asshole when he drinks Southern Comfort, then tell him, "No, dude. You drink that shit away from me."
Why? Or use chopper at the tavern and helicopter when trying to impress the hot medical student's parents. Sometimes you eat your pie with a fork, other times you can eat it with your hands. (Space Cadet by Robert Heinlein)
10. The modern man makes sure the dishes on the rack have dried completely before putting them away.
12. The modern man checks the status of his Irish Spring bar before jumping in for a wash. Too small, it gets swapped out.
14. The modern man still jots down his grocery list on a piece of scratch paper. The market is no place for his face to be buried in the phone.
15. The modern man has hardwood flooring. His children can detect his mood from the stamp of his Kenneth Cole oxfords.
No, pretty sure the spouse will care more. Hardwood floors are easier to clean, carpets are warmer. Let the spouse worry about it. And stamping around to tell his children what mood he is in is childish.
16. The modern man lies on the side of the bed closer to the door. If an intruder gets in, he will try to fight him off, so that his wife has a chance to get away.
Again, the spouse may have other ideas, eg "That's sweet honey, but she's your dog, you sleep on her side of the bed." or "That's sweet honey, but you want the window open when it's 50 degrees out, you sleep next to it."
17. Does the modern man have a melon baller? What do you think? How else would the cantaloupe, watermelon and honeydew he serves be so uniformly shaped?
Of all the kitchen wisdom he could have picked, he chose this one. How to grille, use cast iron, follow a simple recipe are far better choices.
20. On occasion, the modern man is the little spoon. Some nights, when he is feeling down or vulnerable, he needs an emotional and physical shield.
Not very often. Maybe if he's been diagnosed with cancer or something, but no, not more than once per ten years.
21. The modern man doesn’t scold his daughter when she sneezes while eating an apple doughnut, even if the pieces fly everywhere.
22. The modern man still ambles half-naked down his driveway each morning to scoop up a crisp newspaper.
Depends on which half, and why a newspaper? If you mean, he doesn't give a shit if the neighbors see him in sweat pants and bathrobe, then sure.
23. The modern man has all of Michael Mann’s films on Blu-ray (or whatever the highest quality thing is at the time).
Watch what you like. Who the hell is Michael Mann? I'd rather have Casablanca, Stalag 17, and the Martian.
24. The modern man doesn’t get hung up on his phone’s battery percentage. If it needs to run flat, so be it.
Myself, buying a gun for self defense brings up that kid from 'A Christmas Story.' I might really shoot my eye out.
Thinking back, we weren't a gun family. You called the police for things like that. In fact, my Dad never said anything about physically defending the homestead.
Sure a man is responsible for that, but how much is enough? Good locks, a cell phone and a dog to wake you up? Sure. Maybe add pepper spray or a taser.
But a gun? How many? One gun? Two? Is a 22LR enough or do you need a 45? One reddit post on your first gun suggested a Ruger 10/22 to learn how to shoot, a Glock for carry, an AR15 for uh, something. At what point do you shrug and say 'That's a twenty-seven ninja scenario'? You do realize violent crime is at an all-time low, right?
Dad did harp on supporting myself. He wasn't going to do it. The bill collectors come every month, so you best be able to pay them. And running a debt on your credit card is stupid. So is rent-to-own, 90% of the time. Defending yourself economically happens every month, so you better have your bank-account fu up to match your spending.
As for physical self defense, I'm toying with the concept a man should know his fisticuffs and stay in good shape before buying a gun for self defense. So many places he won't have a gun, but having some idea how to throw a punch can't be taken from him. But I'm still sorting out this concept.
Again, if you like guns, buy a gun. Enjoy safely. (If you like your AR because it's Legos for grownups, knock yourself out!)
No. When his mom, brother, college buddy or dog dies, yes. If he has to blow his nose at the end of A Christmas Carol or It's a Wonderful Life, then that's allergies, or invisible onion-cutting ninjas. But full on sobbing? Often? No.
27. People aren’t sure if the modern man is a good dancer or not. That is, until the D.J. plays his jam and he goes out there and puts on a clinic.
What? I'd say a man should know the waltz, two-step, and East coast swing, including knowing how to signal a turn.
For many years, I've wanted to see Heinlein's last Hugo award winning novel converted to a movie. Seeing the plucky Loonies fight off the hamfisted Terran Federation would be definitely very enjoyable. Recently, however, I've come to see some major problems with the novel as a movie.
The first relates to a major issue in the novel - the low gravity of the Moon. It figures in many aspects of the storyline. The inhabitants of the Moon are permanentally adapted to the one sixth gee, and can't return to earth for any sort of normal existence. When the Federation lands troops on the moon to suppress the revolt, the troops are hampered by their inexperience, and the Loonies use this to their advantage. In any adaptation of the novel, the gravity should figure in every scene, not just a few. Depicting the low gravity is very difficult.
The movie Gravity did show zero gee very well, and for the full length of the movie. However Cuaro only had to show one person moving in zero gee- not whole families, riots and battles. The one sixth gravity would be quite the hindrance of translating the novel and it has to be shown.
Another issue is that Heinlein told us about a revolt on the moon, but did not show it. Much of the preparation of for the rebellion is laid out in expository pages. Heinlein, master that he was, got away with it, but it won't work for a video art form. The directory could opt for numerous montage scenes, but that gets old fast.
Heinlein also glossed over several character issues. He shows a long discussion with Manny and Stuart Lajoie to enlighten the reader as to the social status of females and the social heirarchy on Luna. He skips later scenes when Lajoie becomes entranced with Manny's family, and not only figures out what's going on, but joins the rebellion as soon as he's informed. In a later scene Manny complains that many of Prof's friends spoke down to him during the time when Luna was preparing for invasion. But this was never shown. The first the reader hears of it is when Manny complains about it.
The obvious solution for these two issues is of course to write more material. Introduce more characters and show them joining the rebellion and what it means. Let us see Lajoie get swayed by Wyoming Knott, watch his face as he puts clues together and figures out whats going on. Show the progression of the revolt from the formation of the cell system, to the gang rape and riots that resulted with the Loonies overthrowing the local authorities. This of course would mean not a movie, but a full HBO or Netflix style series. Maybe show three seasons, one season for the insurgency, one for the rebellion and one for fighting the invasion forces.
Finally their are several major plot holes that need to be resolved. The first involves the various tricks Mycroft plays on the occupying forces. Unlike 1965, computers are now prevalent in society. The first thing Alvarez would think of would be computer viruses or back doors allowing access to the mainframe. As the local computer consultant, they would heavily scrutinize Manny. Perhaps some sort of LeCarre sting could be worked out to redirect attention to some one else - a very smart computer scientist on the Fed's payroll, but it would still be difficult. Alvarez would know what was happening, he just couldn't prove it. He may even campaign for a total reboot that would destroy Mycroft.....hmmm that could lead to a heist episode where Manny has to download Mycroft to a portable disk drive. Okay, maybe this plot hole could be fixed, but the writers would have to spend some time on it.
The second major plot hole involves sending convicts to the moon to do the Fed's farm labor. With a long waiting list for colonizing Mars, I don't think it would be difficult to find volunteers to colonize the moon. Why send dangerous convicts who would more like as not drag their heels and try to sabotage every project? The moon is only three seconds from the earth- many tasks could be done by drones monitored from earth. The idea doesn't make sense.
Also, consider the whole 'farming wheat on the moon to resolve a hunger crises on earth' scheme. Heinlein was only guessing at the amount of Lunar water, but we now know there isn't very much. The lunar regolith lacks carbon and nitrogen, vital necessities for any agricultural endeavors. Any scheme to send convicts to the moon to farm food for earth would just be met with a puzzled look and the question, "Why not just build more prison farms in Nebraska and Alabama?"
A plot point about the rebellion was the Loonies had to revolt or face a severe ecologic crisis as they mined the last of their water. They would not even be able to feed themselves, let alone the teaming masses of India or China. With all the current emphasis on sustainability, I'm not sure how no one would notice that the Moon is running out of water, carbon and nitrogen. The scheme in the later part of the novel where an indigenous Lunar authority increases grain shipments would be utterly ludicrous.
The idea of the descendants of convicts on the moon revolting against outside authority certainly touches part of the human spirit, but making a movie from Heinlein's book presents far too many problem. It's a shame though, because I'd love to see it.
Leverage - replace term privilege. Privilege tends to be something people enjoy, and don't work at. Think of it as how much lever arm you have to get things done in your life. Has connotation of pushing down, working on the lever. Also applies to all sorts of situations - Parents stayed married, are supportive, culture of can do attitude. Refer to folks 'He had some short lever days but he worked hard and got ahead.'
Still not perfect. Anybody that had to pull an all nighter to get a project finished or pull multiple weeks of sixteen hour days won't like it. When you're in the trenchs hard to think about your leverage, cause working hard is hard work. Romney is a long lever guy, but wonder how much that crossed his mind in the last three weeks of the election with twenty hour days.
These started with a joke I heard back when Independence Day came out. Supposedly during the scene where the Brett Spiner character is getting thrashed by the alien in the exoskeleton, in some theatre somewhere, a small boy piped up "In real life, Data would kick the alien's butt."
I started collecting more 'in real life' sayings, where reality gets a littly blurry. Here are two I remember, and will add more as I come across them.
During the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the governor went on TV and pathetically cried, begging the federal government for assistance. In real life, if Laura Roslin was governor, she would have organized and led her own convoy into New Orleans, twenty four hours ahead of FEMA.
While watching Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, I felt a moment of liking for Anakin Skywalker when he insisted they investigate the attempted assasination of Padma. But then I realized, in real life, Lord Auditor Vorkosigan would have unmasked Palpatine in about three days, cutting out the need for a third movie.

"We are not alone. Africa, Asia and free and liberated people from every corner of the world will always be found at the side of the Congolese" by Patrice Lumumba
Native to Portland, educated at Reed College and M.I.T., David Curt Morris has made his home in New York City since 1985. He has completed many commissioned sculptures for sites in Palm Springs, Santa Barbara, Chicago, Portland, and Vashon Island. Throughout his career, his work has been shown in many curated exhibitions including the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, the Musée d’Art Moderne in Paris, the International Art Expo in Chicago, and the Bronx Museum in New York. Most recently, his work was included in an invitational sculpture exhibit on Governor’s Island, New York.
It’s both easy and hard to wrap your head around I Am This: Art by Oregon Jewish Artists, the elegant small new exhibit at the Oregon Jewish Museum and Center for Holocaust Education.
Easy because the choices of artists are mostly familiar to Portland art followers, and because they share curator Bruce Guenther’s taste for modern and contemporary works that deal, whatever else might be going on in them, with the notion of beauty.
Hard because the questions the exhibit asks – What does it mean to be Jewish? What does it mean to be a Jewish artist? What does it mean to be a Jewish artist from Oregon? – are so elusive, with so many different answers, and ultimately with so many unanswered and perhaps unanswerable question marks. “Here we are, looking inward,” museum director Judith Margles remarked at a press preview last week, and maybe that’s at least a large part of what being Jewish means.
Have you ever missed a personal deadline for something (like a making a doctor's or dentist appointment) and the further you get past it, the harder it it is to do it? That happened it me and I found that I can go a LONG time before I finally break down and do it, 2 years and 8 months, apparently. Well in that time I have learned quite a bit about SQL and hope to be able to post something informative about every two weeks that isn't just a rehash of what you can find on other peoples blogs. Anyway, on with the post..
Lately I have been doing some research and testing into the configuration of Tempdb. I won't rehash all the details of how or why you should change the default settings since there are people who I would just be paraphrasing:
What I am going to do is tell you about an error I kept getting when I was testing out some different configurations and how I resolved it.
Almost all of the information that you find on the internet about TempDB configuration tells you that you need to have more than one data file for TempDB so you don't suffer performance issues related to page allocation contention. There are some varying opinions on how many you need to have. Some say 1 file per core up to 8, some say 1 file for every 2 cores. There are also opinions on how to properly size the data files and the log file. You can read about them in the links above or with a google search. One important thing to note is that most everyone says you need to right size your data files and turn off auto-growth. This allows TempDB to allocate space in a round robin fashion. If one file is much bigger and has more free space, it will get the writes until the free space is reduced to the size of the other files.
My current task at work is to come up with a script that can automatically create the TempDB files and size them. In our current build doc we just create 8 TempDB files (even if we only have 4 cores) and size them at 1GB with auto grow at 1GB. My plan was to mess around with some different configurations and try out different numbers of data files. I the first test, I just took our existing 8 file standard and sized them to 80% of the disk that they are on.
--- Calculate 80% of the total drive size and divide that by the number of files to get individual file size
Once, I was finished with that script I wanted to reset TempDB so that it only had one file so I could try something different. I used DBCC SHRINKFILE to empty out each TempDB file and then REMOVE FILE to remove them.
It looks like something is using my TempDB files so I can't get rid of them. (This is a test server but it does have some other non-prod stuff running on it). I tried restarting SQL service and running the script as soon as it started but I still got the error on most of the files. Something started using the TempDB data files right when SQL started and I couldn't get them deleted. I started thinking about how I could force everything to use just one of the TempDB files so I could delete the other ones. Can you figure out what I did based on something I have already said in this article?
The solution that worked was I increased the size of the main TempDB file so that it was much larger than the other files. Then when I restarted SQL Service all the TempDB writes went to that files since it had more free space then the other ones. Right after restart I ran my delete script and was left with one TempDB datafile so I could start working with another configuration.
I know this isn't a groundbreaking post (gimme a break, it's my first one back) but I love it when you can take some information that you are learning or just read about and then you apply it in a real life situation like this. I'll be back in two weeks, no idea of a topic yet but I'll think of something.

Deaths Head Designs announces the creation of SHIRT STORIES, the newest, hottest concept in publishing. SHIRT STORIES are tees that tell a tale in a unique and compelling way using cutting edge graphics. Wearable entertainment. They put you in the story! Everyone has seen comics reprinted on tee shirts, but you’ve never seen anything like SHIRT STORIES. These are original sequential art tales designed for on-the-tee presentation. They utilize the whole shirt and the body in it for maximum impact. SHIRT STORIES are comics—but with a 3-D twist!
The first SHIRT STORIES feature Bad Kids, offbeat outcasts whose curiosity, rotten judgment and all out badness lead to ill-but-funny adventures. The second release planned is City Girl, a charming, thoughtful examination of the social difficulties facing a single woman living in Manhattan. In other words, it’s no Sex in the City, literally and literally—but you’ll laugh! You’ll cry! And a few may be inspired to move to the burbs. Several other titles are in the works as well as some collaborations with well-known comic book luminaries.
Some SHIRT STORIES tees tell a whole tale from beginning to end, but others will feature chapters in a continued story on 2, 3 or more shirts. This can lead to endless opportunities for the wearer. People could wear a new chapter every day and deliver the whole story episode by episode to everyone you work or hang with. Or, a group of friends could each wear a different chapter out on the town and entertain the masses en masse. Which brings us to the true uniqueness of the SHIRT STORIES concept… They offer the wearer the chance to be an active partner in bringing the stories to the audience in person on person. instead of comics being a private, passive, one-way diversion, SHIRT STORIES turn the wearer into the entertainment by fusing the irresistible appeal of comics with fashion. And, everybody loves comics. Come on, admit it, when somebody next to you on the train turns to the funny pages or reads a comic book, your eyes are drawn to it. Comics are compelling.

[Old High Ger. danson=to drag, stretch], the art of precise, expressive, and graceful human movement, traditionally, but not necessarily, performed in accord with musical accompaniment. Dancing developed as a natural expression of united feeling and action.
The earliest history of human dance is a continuing mystery. From the evidence of illustrated ceramic fragments, some archaeologists have speculated that dance originated some 5,000 to 9,000 years ago in early agricultural cultures located in a swath running from modern Pakistan to the Danube basin. Others, however, have expressed caution regarding the reconstruction of social behavior from such sources. Speculation aside, specific knowledge of prehistoric dances is lacking, and thus many experts have extrapolated dance history from the preserved ritual dances of various preliterate societies.
Native American dances illustrate most of the purposes of dance that is of a ritualistic or ceremonial nature: the war dance, expressing prayer for success and thanksgiving for victory; the dance of exorcism or healing, performed by shamans to drive out evil spirits; the dance of invocation, calling on the gods for help in farming, hunting, the fertility of human beings and animals, and other tribal concerns; initiation dances for secret societies; mimetic dances, illustrating events in tribal history, legend, or mythology; dances representing cosmic processes; and, more rarely, the dance of courtship, an invocation for success in love. The dance of religious ecstasy, in which hypnotic or trancelike states are induced (a characteristic phenomenon of Southeast Asia and Africa), was represented in America by the remarkable Ghost DanceGhost Dance,
central ritual of the messianic religion instituted in the late 19th cent. by a Paiute named Wovoka. The religion prophesied the peaceful end of the westward expansion of whites and a return of the land to the Native Americans.
Native American dancing is always performed on the feet, but in many islands of the Pacific and in Asia some of the dances are performed in a sitting posture, with only the hands, arms, and upper parts of the body used. Ancient Egyptian dances, often of a religious character, were derived from earlier African forms. In Greece the choral dance in honor of Dionysus played a part in the development of the drama and in religious worship. Many early religious or celebratory dances have survived in the folk dancefolk dance,
primitive, tribal, or ethnic form of the dance, sometimes the survival of some ancient ceremony or festival. The term is used also to include characteristic national dances, country dances, and figure dances in costume to folk tunes.
In India dance and drama have usually been related, both generally having religious significance. An elaborate code of movements of the arms and hands (mudras), expressive use of the face and especially of the eyes, and a sinuous posturing of the body are important features of Indian classical dancing, among the best-known examples being Kathakali and the Bharata Natyam, both of S India. The early dances of Japan, probably influenced by ancient Chinese forms, became institutionalized with the establishment of a national school of dancing in the 14th cent. Soon the dance became associated with the famous No drama (see Asian dramaAsian drama,
dramatic works produced in the East. Of the three major Asian dramas—Sanskrit, Chinese, Japanese—the oldest is Sanskrit, although the dates of its origin are uncertain.
In medieval Europe the repeated outbreaks of dance mania, a form of mass hysteria sometimes caused by religious frenzy and usually associated with epidemics of bubonic plague, are reflected in the allegory of the dance of death (see Death, Dance ofDeath, Dance of,

During the Middle Ages, especially in France, dancing was a feature of the more enlightened and convivial courts. Some medieval dances, such as the volta, precursor of the waltz, became the sources of modern dance steps. In the 16th cent. two types of dance were popular, the solemn and stately dances performed at the court of Charles IX and the lively peasant dances.

serious theatrical dance forms that are distinct from both ballet and the show dancing of the musical comedy or variety stage. The Beginnings of Modern Dance
From earliest times, dancing has been an integral part of religious worship and of magical practice. The dance was, in many ways, considered a prayer, a spell, or an invocation. Gertrude Prokosch Kurath, in Funk & Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend, says, "Folk dance is communal reaction in movement patterns to life's crucial cycles." Pennethorne Hughes describes dance as "an extremely early expression of the emotional and rhythmic unity of the group." Throughout the world, humankind has celebrated life and communion with deity in dance. Its origins can probably be traced to early human mimicking of the stalking and slaying of game, perhaps as part of a hunting magic ritual.
Dancing around the Maypole on May Day is an example of an ancient dance custom. The phallic symbolism of the Maypole or Tree is generally accepted. Fine examples of such Maypole dancing are depicted in the stained glass windows of churches in England, such as the one at Batley, Staffordshire, dating from the reign of Henry VIII. One window depicts a figure astride a hobbyhorse. A similar hobbyhorse figure is included in the group that performs the ancient Abbotts Bromley Horn Dance, still enacted in the county of Staffordshire, England. Performed on the first Sunday after September 4, the Abbotts Bromley Horn Dance is the oldest such surviving ceremony in Britain, possessing shades of the shamanic magical workings of prehistoric times.
Dance was a part of Christian worship up into the seventeenth century, especially in Spain. In 1282, at Inverkeithing in Scotland, the village priest was admonished (but not punished) for leading his parishioners in a dance about a phallic symbol as part of the Easter celebrations. According to Pennethorne Hughes, dancing still occurs in the Church of Abyssinia.
It is no surprise, therefore, that dancing should have been an integral part of a religion so full of life as Witchcraft. Leaping dances, astride pitchforks, poles, and broomsticks were a part of fertility rites to promote the growth of crops (see broomstick). Dancing was also a big part of Witches' sabbat celebrations. Margaret Alice Murray suggests that there were two main types of dance at these: the ring dance and the followyour-leader type. Pierre de Lancre (Tableau de l'Inconstance des Mauvais Anges, Paris, 1613) described such a ring dance, saying, "once the banquet was finished the dancing began around a large tree, the participants dancing back to back in a ring." Thomas Cooper (Pleasant Treatise of Witches London, 1673) reported, "The dance is strange, and wonderful, as well as diabolical, for turning themselves back to back, they take one another by the arms and raise each other from the ground, then shake their heads to and fro like Anticks, and turn themselves as if they were mad." There is a detail of this back-to-back dancing in the painting The Entry of Isabel of Bavaria into Paris as Bride of Charles VI in the Bibilothèque Nationale, Paris.
In 1590 the North Berwick Witches (see Scottish Witchcraft) danced all around the churchyard. "Gelie Duncan played on a trump, John Fian, missellit, led the ring; Agnes Sampson and her daughters and all the rest following the said Barbara, to the number of seven score of persons," according to Robert Pitcairn (Criminal Trials, Edinburgh, 1833). Musical instruments varied, from Gelie Duncan's trump to trumpets, violins, drums, and tambourines. There was also much singing, as there is today at Wiccan gatherings.
Dancing Master or Dancing Mistress seems to have been one of the important positions in the old covens. Murray says, "One duty seems to have been delegated to a particular individual, who might perhaps hold no other office, or who might, on the other hand, be the chief official; this was the manager, often the leader, of the dance. As pace seems to have been an essential in the dance, the leader was necessarily active and generally young." One of the dances in use with most traditions is the meeting dance—a spiral dance that winds into the center and out again. As the Witches pass one another, males kiss females and females kiss males in greeting.
Many surviving examples of old Pagan dances can be found today, for example, in Morris dancing. The "dibbling" of sticks into the ground, as part of some of the dances, ties in with the planting of seeds, while the clashing of sticks and waving of handkerchiefs is intended to disperse negative spirits. In many of the Morris dances, the dancers leap high in the air in much the same way that the Pagans and Witches of old leapt high as part of imitative magic when showing the crops how high to grow.
Dancing is one of the ways for Witches to raise the power required to work magic. By moving rhythmically, clapping or slapping the body, and perhaps chanting, a state of ekstasis is brought on to direct the power raised to bring about the end sought. In Voodoo a similar ekstasis is achieved through dancing, which is done to the rhythmic beating of the drums. The ensuing ecstasy leads to the entry of the loa, the Voodoo deities.
an art form that employs bodily movements and gestures to express artistic images. Dance was first based on various movements connected with man’s work and man’s impressions of the surrounding world. The movements gradually became stylized, and the art of the dance evolved as one of the earliest examples of folk arts. Initially linked with speech and song, dance gradually acquired importance as an independent art form. Dance traditions have developed among all peoples of the world.
Stage dance, which is based on folk dance, became highly developed in the professional theater and was thoroughly systematized. Various schools of dance developed, including European classical dance, which is the basis of contemporary ballet, Asian dance, including the Indian kathak, kathakali, manipuri, tamasha, and African dance. Folk dance was also the basis of ballroom dance.
As an art form, dance is a means of intellectual and emotional expression. The artistic quality of a given dance is determined by its thematic content and the way it is performed. The chief means of expression used in dance are harmonious movements and poses, plasticity, and facial expression; important features of the dance are dynamics, rhythm, and design (arrangement of movements). Costumes and stage props are used to enhance the beauty of dances and to make dance visually real. Ballet is enriched by dramaturgy, which lends it particular expressive power. The most basic element of dance movement is the tempo. Individual steps are grouped into combinations. Dance is measured by the same rhythmic units as music.
The dance of antiquity exerted a great influence on the development of European dance, for example, the religious dances in Assyria and Egypt and various dances in Greece, including dances in honor of Apollo, Bacchus, and other gods, the pyrrhic war dances, and the gymnopaedic dances, all of which were an integral part of the Greek theater. Dancer-mimes appeared in the Hellenistic period, between the fourth and second centuries B.C. During the second and first centuries B.C., the Romans adopted Hellenistic dance, which they subsequently developed as pantomime in the second and fifth centuries A.D.
During the Middle Ages dance was discouraged by the clergy. Later, dance was gradually theatricalized by jongleurs, Spielmänner, and skomorokhi (Russian itinerant performers). In the 15th and 16th centuries, Morescas (narrative dance scenes) were performed and the first treatises and textbooks on the dance were written.
With the appearance of the first ballets in the early 17th century, a new dance technique evolved. The French Academy of Dance (founded 1661) codified what subsequently became known as classical dance. Reforms in music, for example, the opera reform of C. Gluck, influenced the structure of ballets, helping ballet emerge as an independent art form.
During the Enlightenment, ballet became emotionally and dramatically more profound. The pas d’action, a dance with narrative or thematic content, evolved and later was developed in the romantic ballet. During the second half of the 19th century, a new virtuoso dance style developed, facilitated by special point shoes, which permitted the ballerina to stand, move about, and execute rapid turns while on her toes. A great contribution was made to ballet in the late 19th century by the symphonic composers P. I. Tchaikovsky and A. K. Glazunov and the choreographers M. I. Petipa and L. I. Ivanov. Their innovations included the use of leitmotifs and the coordination of the choreography of soloists and the corps de ballet.
The character dance, a balletic stylization of folk dance, developed in ballet and was followed by an interest in genuine folk dance, elements of which were employed by many Russian choreographers, including M. M. Fokine, K. Ia. Goleizovskii, and F. V. Lopukhov. Experiments were conducted in new choreographic forms, and the traditional structure of the pas de deux, pas de trois, and grand pas was discarded.
By the late 19th century, a new school of dance had evolved. Conventionally termed “modern dance” (or “free,” “plastic,” or “rhythmic” dance), it was originally based on the methods of F. Delsarte and E. Jaques-Dalcroze. I. Duncan also exerted an influence on the development of modern dance. In Europe and the USA between the 1940’s and the 1960’s, modern dance borrowed elements from classical ballet, and ballet likewise adopted certain elements of modern dance. The dance of the variety stage, in which performers strive for virtuosity and striking, expressive technique, has also developed.
Dance has become especially popular in the USSR, where numerous amateur and professional dance companies have been established, including song and dance ensembles. National schools of dance have been founded by peoples who once lacked developed dance traditions or whose traditions had disappeared, such as the Turkmen, Kazakhs, and Kirghiz. Soviet choreographers utilize classical dance as the most highly perfected dance system. Distinctive schools of ballet are developing in the national republics on the basis of the Russian school of ballet. An integrated system of teaching has been adopted in the ballet schools of the USSR, and textbooks and teaching aids have been created for folk dancing, ballet, character dancing, and ballroom dancing.
Dancing is a rich symbol, capable of many different interpretations. Depending on the type of movement in which we engage, dancing may be associated with romance and sex, with the experience of freedom from constraints, with participating in life or in social activities (the dance of life), with frivolity, with gracefulness, or with group cooperation.

On 26/07/17 I wrote to Gwent Police and senior Aneurin Bevan University Health Board Trust Mental Health Nursing Manager, Perry Attwell.
I have been wanting to write to you, with regard to the current status of my detainment under section of the mental health act at my home address.
I have been subjected to the mental health act since 2nd April 1997. I have never been violent towards the police nor mental health workers during the 20 years in which I have been treated. At present, I feel that there is an over-reaction to me when I am processed for sectioning under the mental health act. There are up to 50 police officers in my street during a sectioning and the whole process is very daunting both for myself and also the officers. I am transferred in the back of the police van like a common prisoner and feel that this aggravated my early stay in hospital. As I am never aggressive, I am asking you that, for any potential future assessments, we have a low key approach whereby, if necessary the police can attend in a single car and transfer me in the back of a car, humanely, and so that my mental health in the community is preserved for any potential hospital assessment. I feel that as things stand, with such a hullabaloo raised, it doesn’t assist me nor my local community in the whole process. These most recent hospitalizations have cost me my career at university and I am really struggling to rebuild my life. I am never going to be violent or troublesome and do not wish to be portrayed in a bad light in my neighborhood with a vast police presence and a seemingly violent capture ahead of any mental hospital admittances. Also, Perry Attwell has mentioned to me himself that he would be arranging for me to be transferred directly to Talygarn and not being sent to the processing unit at St Cadoc’s. I ask for a response to this letter as I wish to improve the oft fractured relations I have with this whole service as part of my processing under the Mental Health Act. Theresa May says that she wishes to improve Human Rights for mental patients and here I believe that, at grass roots, I am helping to do just that.
After a very long delay and much avoidance by the requested parties to attend this meeting, I finally managed to sit down and meet with mental health managers and police in an attempt to diffuse the whole of my mental health situation / saga. Here is a report I have prepared about this meeting:
After waiting impatiently for this meeting since I first tried to arrange it last July, I finally managed to get the chance to sit down with some of the local police and senior mental health management on Thursday, 26th October 2017 at Caldicot Library. I had wanted to begin a dialogue so as to analyze exactly what was happening in both the police and mental health services during the far too often sectioning process that they have been using on me for a number of years. It seems that not twelve months can go by without me being aggressively taken out of my home or off the street and removed to Talygarn and St Cadoc’s for lengthy stays. Every time I come before an appeals court these days I win my case so it is becoming ever more annoying that the police and mental health community teams plus psychiatrists in the hospital are persisting in performing these sections. It is so disruptive to me and has continued for over 20 years and I do not intend for it to go on any longer. I am trying to nip the whole saga in the bud and this meeting, whilst I am free and comfortable at home, I felt would be a good way of starting a constructive dialogue to help end the process. Senior manager Perry Atwell, has been taking an active role during my care in recent years and he, for one, is hoping to end the repeat process of me being taken into hospital as he on the whole feels it unnecessary. Unfortunately Perry has now retired from his senior management role and Anne James has taken his place. I have known Anne for most of the 20 years for which I have been a patient.
Anne James was present at the meeting. Also, my social worker / care co-ordinator, Elen Mcelroy. Plus psychologist John Baird (about to retire). Representing Gwent police there were two WPCs. I didn’t manage to record their names although I was aware of one as she has previously processed me during a detainment. The one WPC was senior mental health representative for the whole of Gwent. The other WPC was specifically the mental health liaison officer for my local area.
The whole atmosphere was pretty hostile from the start. I explained some of my grievances. The police denied tasering me etc. They denied assaulting me in the cells. Everyone was pretty much of the steadfast opinion that there has been no wrongdoing on behalf of the powers that be and that all that had been done was necessary. Anne James admitted that in the twenty years I have NEVER once been a danger to myself or others. I have though been sectioned and get regularly aggressively sectioned on no fewer than fifty occasions. The whole criteria of being sectioned means that you have to present as a danger to yourself or others. Yet, here on record, they have admitted that this has never been the case. The police corroborated that I have never been violent to them in any way nor have I any form of criminal record.
The police stated that they have no interest in fighting crime in the local area any more. They said that nowadays their policing was to be targeted towards the policing of vulnerable people.
They said that the main reason of me being violently sectioned by them was that in their view, when they turn up to my property they feel that I am intimidating in character towards them. I explained that I was not trying to intimidate them but that based on the history of what they have been doing to me for years that I am genuinely in fear for my life when they turn up. I cannot go past a police officer or car in the street without experiencing a panic attack through fear of them. It is more them who are intimidating me and the facts and evidence will verify this.
They said that when a magistrate passes an order they are just doing their jobs. I asked as to why they were using this system which is open to corruption. I do not get processed fairly under the mental health act as it is supposed to be.
They said that the social workers involved – mainly Linda Price – have a way of perceiving that I might be perceiving something that might make me mentally ill and they apply to judges for these orders.
In other words I am being detained and sectioned and locked away based on pure speculation of Orwellian ‘thought crime’.
It is illegal, unjust and wrong and must be stopped somehow. It is no way for me to live in constant fear from these hideous people.
I have never experienced the symptoms of any of the diagnosed mental illnesses they accuse me of. I have never sought treatment from them. I never take their medications willingly. It is all done against my will and consent and by using violent force. It has simply gone on for too long.
They have said that the whole process will not be stopped, will not go away and will simply intensify in the years ahead. They want to have more access to me in the community and to lock me away more regularly.
To be honest, the whole meeting was a shambles, very much what I expect from a broken dilapidated system that has perpetually abused me for years on end.
I am hoping that someone will be able to assist me in getting a better result from this attempt to diffuse the situation and also to look at the wider picture of how this system and its actors might be detrimentally affecting the lives of other victims.
At the very least I demand a full investigation into local mental health services and practices. If they have no evidence for their persecution of me then it should surely be stopped once and for all. They will end up killing me one way or another if they are allowed to proceed and we are not some third world country with no legal process or 21st century morals. We are supposed to be a democracy where freedom is almost guaranteed.

In 2000 I went to hospital after attempting suicide not long after my mother passed away, aged 48. I had also not long split up with my girlfriend of four years and was really down in every way. I decided to visit a casino in Birmingham which I was a member of but hardly frequented, lost about £1000 on gambling, bought a few bottles of JD and some pain killers, went home and attempted the deed. I was only found because when i arrived home, I had left my front door wide open and the couple next door had called the Police as they had thought I’d been broken into.
Hell yeah! I woke up on the first night to a woman running up and down the wing on fire, screaming like a Banshee. I thought I was tripping and went back to sleep. It wasn’t until the next day when the other residents were talking about it that I realised that it wasn’t bad drugs…
Medication wise, it was always a struggle. Just when i thought I’d found the cure, the side effects would kick in, sometimes making it physically impossible to take them. My first prescribed meds had me trying to iron clothes with the kettle.
I have always been very, very open with my illness which has left me open to certain folks taking advantage or ridiculing me. Worse than that are the folks that try and help but the minute something goes wrong in some way, blame it on me because it must be my fault…
How have you built your life back together away from the mental health system?Apart from a few times when I was addicted to drugs (my way of self medicating at the time), I have very little to do with services.
Actually care and when you’re having an ‘off’ day and this goes to friends and family of all sufferers, stop asking if we’ve taken our meds. We can be pissed off to you know.

Today, after four years of campaigning, I finally met with Welsh Assembly Member, John Griffiths AM. John is my local political representative in the Welsh Assembly. In Wales, health is a devolved matter and is dealt with in the Cardiff National Assembly, rather than in parliament. Since the launch of End Of Terror five years ago, both John Griffiths and his parliamentary cohort, Jessica Morden MP, have attentively supported our needs. There has been an extensive correspondence via email and I am regularly in touch via telephone with both their offices. On no fewer than two previous occasions our scheduled public meetings have been cancelled due to me being sectioned. It is thus much overdue that I finally met in public with John, in order to thrash out the End Of Terror campaign and to seek a much-needed political solution to the issues that the #EoT movement raises. We met at 2pm on Friday, 6th January 2017, at Aroma Coffee Shop in Caldicot Town Centre.
John is well up to speed on all End Of Terror developments and in addition to our current filings with the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales, John has kindly petitioned the Welsh Minister for Health, on our behalf. In a previous post you can see some of EoT’s political agenda and the issues that we campaign for politically. – See –
John listened attentively to my campaigning for well over an hour and explained to me in detail on how best to pursue my cause. He identified that in order to successfully petition the government that End Of Terror need to network more and grow its supporter base in order to achieve more political clout. He mentioned that organisations such as MIND are successful in getting the government’s attention as they speak on behalf of a multitude of campaigners. I think that at End Of Terror we shall certainly use John’s advice and try to expand our reach and involve more people. to date it has sort of been an individual’s campaign by me and I am but a lone wolf, crying in the darkness.
We spoke about the concerns I have about the local system being far too decadent and out of control. There is a definite need for psychiatrists and their employees to be reigned in. I really want there to be a system of balances and checks in place so that omnipotent psychiatrist power can be curtailed. We spoke about the need to divorce police power from mental health services and also for a fairer court system to be put in place. I want a twenty-first century mental health service and an abolishment of Victorian Bedlamist attitudes towards mental health sufferers.
There was a recognition that Big Pharma is out of control and that there is an overdependence on clinical solutions when perhaps more should be done with improving talking therapies. John mentioned the statistics that one in three people now suffer from a mental health issue. I am especially keen to erode the power of Big Pharma, the multibillion dollar fraud that drives this hideous inhumane industry.
Ideally, there will be more power for mental health advocates who at present are in a position of limbo, despite the Labour government’s introduction of them as an entity some decade or so ago.
I suggested that the Welsh government consult mental health solicitors more as these are a body of people who are intelligent and have their finger on the pulse in being able to truly assess the reality of mental health services in a holistic manner.
John said that he would try and open the doors for me with regard to consulting the mental health committees in government and we talked of the need to also meet Jessica Morden MP in future in order to make changes in Parliament itself.
I was keen to encourage John and other local politicians to visit their local hospitals, just to see for themselves how threadbare services here actually are. We must end the inhumane conditions for mental patients, wherever they are. I stressed how there must be an end to treating mental patients like animals and to rid the subhuman attitudes that divide the gulf between staff and patients.
John is keen to erode the public stigma attached to mental health sufferers and he feels that there is movement towards mental health achieving parity with physical health services across Wales. John recognises that often in the past mental health has been a ‘Cinderella service’ that has been overlooked.
John was pleased that I am currently outside of the mental health system and that I am getting on with my degree. We agreed to stay in close contact and I am certain that as my political representative, despite mental health being such a difficult area politically, that John will assist our EoT endeavours long into the future.
It was a true pleasure to have the time of such an important person in the local community and I felt pleased that my voice had been heard and I truly believe that real change can now be achieved in the field of mental health in southeast Wales and the wider world. Thank you for your time, Mr Griffiths. All the best for the future from the End Of Terror movement. Let’s all fight together for change and improvement in mental health services…

I really experienced the disaster. And it happened not in Auschwitz and not in Dachau, but in the ordinary mental hospital. It happened yet in childhood. Adults branch staff mercilessly tortured, oppressed us, disadvantaged and without this children
… One night I was awakened by the noise. Opening my eyes, I saw how two nurses are beating the boy, who lies at the window. The boy was trembling. « “Again Vovka has epileptic seizure», – someone said . “How epileptic seizure?!” – I blurted out: “But why to beat ?!” Then the nurse left Vovka for a second and turned to me: Shut up, otherwise, and you will be bad”. That nightly incident was bothering me for long time. I hoped, that gits will be punished. But all gone, as if nothing had happened.
… Once, one nurse pegged me in punishment for disobedience. And did it in a special way: the hands were were fixed to the metal corners of the bed. She had said, that she’ll unbind me, when I’ll ask forgiveness and went away. The circulation was disrupted , the hands swollen. Endure was becoming increasingly difficult. Nurse had entered in the ward and asked, I am going to ask forgivness or not. I hadn’t answer and she left.
The matter was already nearing to an evening. Soon the night shift had to come . I was very hoping, what this damned wretch will go, and the other nurse will unbind me.
However, it soon became clear, that the damned wretch stays on the night shift. She had come into the room and announced by triumphant tone: «Well, do you intend to ask forgiveness?» I wasn’t able to endure anymore and asked forgiveness from this crud as she had wanted. After that I was feeling myself horribly
They constantly indoctrinated us, that at any rate everything will be as they want. Any meanness, any overwhelming nightmare – everything will be as they want.
There was a teenage boy. He was suffering a severe form of epilepsy with mental retardation and was very irritable. The bastards were using this. They were provoking him intentionally and when he had come into anger – they attacked him from all sides and commited reprisal. In the time of the reprisal, when he was already tied, one nurse had gripped his genitals and furiously jerked. That nightmare still causes me stupor.
In general, intimate dignity was the subject of their special, sophisticated hostility. We were all Bug and cows, devil knows that have grown in us. It is terrible how our balls hindered them . The desire to tear off this” surplus ” again and again flied from their trashy sip. And some ones organized games such violence – chased the children and pulled their genitals and this wild nightmare took place quite openly, in front of everyone.
But the most terrible thing was chlorpromazine. The terrible effect can not be described. In what satanic laboratories was prepared this drug!? It was destroying the thinnest, most intimate strings of essence. Its action caused a complete rejection reaction. Every cell, every nerve were screaming with outrage. As long as overwhelming effect of chlorpromazine was manifesting, this reaction was completely suppressed. But as soon as this action is being weakened, the whole being is being filled with rage. But they were continuing to do chlorpromazine else and else.
There was one nurse, very greedy and cynical. She was often substituting others and was on duty multiple shifts in a row. And in order that the duty roster would pass quietly she was doing chlorpromazine to all. She was getting this with different ways. At the beginning with help on duty doctors. There were a lot of young doctors. Basically women. With them she was in familiarly relationships. She was calling a doctor by phone, a doctor was coming and appointing chlorpromazine, even not seeing for whom she appoints. Then they ceased trouble oneself to arrive. They were assigning by a phone. Then and this turned out to be unnecessary. The nurse herself was doing chlorpromazine, and the appoint was being done after, backdating. Then others followed her example .
And no salvation from this destruction remained. I was then completely destroyed! Physically and spiritually. The mind found itself in a state of complete prostration. I lost the ability to feel, resent and somehow to react. In this condition I was discharged home.
After some time, snippets of feelings began to erupt. Firstly the earlier depressed rage as a reaction on the influence of chlorpromazine. Gradually the awareness of what happened filled me. Experiences, that i endured, atrocity, vile, impunity were overflowing me. Precious moments of life, youth sped by. I was biting my lips from despair and was able to change nothing. I was dreaming about a retribution for the bastards. But they were far and i was not be able to do anything against them. And then all of uncontrollable pain fall at the man who was next. – On my poor mother. The dearest person in the world. Who gave me whole life without residue.
When I hit her all yelled in me: «What am I doing?!» And I felt, what i do not govern yourself. And i again was there.
… Again violence, merciless cynicism. Again boorish edification, that everything will be as they want. All they want, they will do – no one is decree for them . Yes, there was no hands on them. Abomination predetermine everything! Unlimited possibilities of absolute nothingness.
I could neither tolerate them, nor resist them! And again they were grinding me and scraping me with chlorpromazine. Until they destroyed all flesh and bone, every nerve, every cell. Human nature did not presuppose such exposure and did not envisage any protection against it. A human must not survive such ruinous exposure. So ruinous effects ssence not should survive.
He must die before going to happen like that. But the sadistic action of chlorpromazine overcame this last protective edge. And destroys not only the essence of life, but also the ability to die.
Here’s what else I want to offer … Petition: https://goo.gl/sMnJ6y signed by much more people! Moderators facebook blocked most of the signatures! The number 1473 – is absolutely false! About it i reported not only once to recipients in UN Human Rights Committee. But they ignored all my appeals. Not on single of letter was not answered. So I suggest to you, what would you also ask them the same. Confirm that the petition actually signed a lot more people. Maybe the appeal of many people, they will not ignore.
I have been a non-consenting patient of southeast Wales’ mental health services since 2nd April 1997. I have almost amassed twenty years of living within this closed mental health system. I write this report with a view to enacting real change for the better for myself and other end users of the mental health services in our area.
Ideally I would like to see the Mental Health Act scrapped in parliament. I feel that it is antiquated and rooted in Victorian Bedlamism.
Psychiatry is not a science. At best it is a pseudoscience. There is little actual medical evidence for most, nearly all mental illnesses. Mental illness, unlike normal illness, cannot be scientifically assessed. If an illness cannot be scientifically diagnosed, how can it be an illness? The blood, body, mind of a schizophrenic is exactly the same as a healthy person. There are no biometric markers that indicate a sickness in someone’s mind. The point is that mental illness is not pathological. Cancer has its markers, as does AIDS. As these illnesses can be scientifically studied and examined, they can also be scientifically treated and hopefully cured. What hope is there for a cure for mental illness if the illness itself cannot be determined scientifically? This point exposes the myth that mental illness is untreatable and cannot be cured. It cannot be cured as it does not exist in the first place. I was given a diagnosis of schizophrenia in 1997. Schizophrenia is apparently an incurable disease. This is not true as it does not exist and I have never suffered the symptoms psychiatrists identify in schizophrenia. For 19 years I have been confident that I have been misdiagnosed and yet I still experience treatment and simply cannot evade the system.
Big Pharma is the driving force behind the mental health industry. For every identified illness there is often expensive treatment available from big global pharmaceutical firms. Drugs companies rarely see their share prices topple and mental health is a very profitable sector. With all this big business and money flying around I often worry about exactly how precise and effective these treatments are. There must be a more ethical means of turning a profit for Big Pharma than mental health drugs, drugs that are often used against the consent of patients.
Treatment against consent is my biggest bugbear in psychiatry. In every branch of medicine the patient has a choice bar psychiatry. If someone falls ill they may choose to consult a healthcare professional or doctor. The doctor can then diagnose illness and offer treatment with a view to curing the illness. At any stage the patient is within his or her rights to refuse the doctor’s advice and to consult elsewhere or simply ignore the treatment. Often illness is an individual matter and if the treatment doesn’t feel right to a patient then why should that patient continue the course of treatment. How many of our medicine cabinets are full of half-used prescriptions of painkillers and antibiotics or the like? In mental health as treatment against consent is condoned and used, patients’ rights are eroded. We move out of a realm of doctors and patients and into a realm of torture and torturer. Treatment against consent is torture plain and simple. It was used in the days of Bedlam, in the Victorian Institutions and has been a cornerstone of the short history of psychiatry and mental hospitals. Yes, some more barbaric, outlandish practices (with no scientific basis) such as lobotomy have been ceased, but treatment against consent continues to this day and with our modern technology and advancements in science chemical lobotomies occur on a daily basis through the use of some of psychiatry’s arsenal. We are talking drugs such as Clozaril, depot injections, Risperidone, Olanzapine.
It is often argued that psychiatrists are dealing with the most disturbed of patients. People always use Peter Sutcliffe in Broadmoor as an extreme example and say how this abhorrent man who has committed abhorrent crimes needs to be treated against his consent. Unfortunately, the vast majority of service users aren’t Peter Sutcliffe, yet they get tarred with the same brush and treatment against consent affects this majority of patients far worse than they do Sutcliffe and other extreme cases. Even in the case of abhorrent psychiatric criminals, these people are human beings with human rights. The choice of treatment and the right to consent to treatment is an absolutely fundamental human right and is part of what separates us as an intelligent species from the animal world. Treatment against consent fosters a concentration camp mentality. It is Nazism, plain and simple, extreme far right use of force to disrupt nature. It is man against the environment in its most absolute ultimate form. Man mistreating other man using torture and chemicals. So much of psychiatry is rooted in eugenics and this is a distant historical archaic fixation that needs to be properly eradicated in order for human society to function properly,
To set this treatment against consent in its context I give you my 19 year case as an extreme example. I have never accepted my diagnosis, nor felt mentally ill. I therefore reject treatment. When under section of the Mental Health Act you lose your right to consent. From Day 1 on my healthcare plan I have been forcibly injected against my consent, with drugs unknown to me and only through experience and research have I discovered what these drugs do. When you refuse tablets in a mental health environment they will turn to injections to guarantee that you take the treatment. They are allowed to use force and in my case have done that or always used the veiled threat of force to get me to take down my trousers so they can inject my thigh or backside. By law, mental health professionals can freely assault, restrain and drug with hardcore, mind and body –altering chemicals with no repercussions. If this happened in a war environment – let’s say Aleppo, there would be international outcry and it would be seen as a war crime, yet it occurs on a daily basis inside British mental hospitals, and worse, with new CTO legislation, also in our communities. Depot injections that I am allergic to have caused me to have a severe hiatus hernia. This makes me projectile vomit all my meals and every morning I start the day puking. It was brought on by depot injections against my consent and the NHS is powerless to stop psychiatrists doing this to me and so my hiatus hernia cannot be treated and cured so I have to live with a permanent disability caused by treatment against consent.
What if treatment against consent was outlawed? It would force the mental health services to adapt greatly. For a start, less emphasis would be on Big Pharma and the medications it produces. We would move away from clinical psychiatry and into the realm of more natural, talking therapies. I’m not saying people should all be freed from mental hospitals, just that the emphasis on drugs would be less. People could choose to be unmedicated and if deemed ill, remain inpatients, but unmedicated ones by choice. When a lay person thinks of a psychiatrist they think that these people sit down and chat with you for hours about your problems and your childhood etc. This is a common misperception. Psychiatrists tend to be just clinical and rely on prescribing drugs. It is psychologists, who aren’t necessarily medically trained, who perform the talking therapies one associates with US Sitcoms and films etc. Psychologists won’t offer you medications. They aren’t doctors so lack prescribing power. They will recommend ways and means of dealing with your problems and often over a period of time will assist you in coping with your problems by identifying root causes and disruptive patterns of behavior. Psychology is a buzz subject academically these days with university departments full, yet try seeing a psychologist on the NHS. You will always find a psychiatrist. They are funded by Big Pharma. I have been on the waiting list to see a psychologist for over ten years. I am deeply embedded in the mental health system with regular hospitalizations yet cannot get to see a psychologist. Aneurin Bevan UHB simply employ too few psychologists and those they do are fully overworked and do not have time for their clientele. The local NHS invest in psychiatry and virtually ignore talking therapies yet it is in these areas where psychiatry and its relevant research are most accurately close to being a proper genuine science. We are supposed to be moving away from clinical mental health environments and towards ‘care in the community’. It is imperative that talking therapies get adequate financial coverage and are accorded a valued place within the therapeutic setup, especially in our local area.
Another great area for improvement locally is another variety of talking therapy in use in mental hospitals, that of occupational therapy. The occupational therapy has as its aim the goal of readying an inpatient for reintegration into the community and outside world. They will work on basic skills, life skills, things one would normally do on the outside and from within a hospital environment an occupational therapist shall aim to get you back to full healthy working order, enough so you can function independently in the real world. Two years ago I met with Judith Paget, Chief Executive, Aneurin Bevan UHB, and in this meeting I emphasized how I disliked the cutbacks that were being made within her system on occupational therapy. To me, as a longstanding mental inpatient, I found the most value in the hospital to be in occupational therapy. Occupational therapy made me feel normal. Whether it be a day trip to the beach, cooking a lunchtime meal for fellow patients, doing a morning crossword or just simple arts and crafts, occupational therapy is vital in an inpatient environment and indeed in out patient aftercare. Yet, consistently over the past twenty years the OT budget has been cut, staff have been laid off and services and end users suffer as a result. On at least three occasions over the past 3 years there has been absolutely zero occupational therapy at all in Talygarn. When you combine the fact that you can’t see a psychologist or engage in other meaningful talking therapies, it seems that the local system is over-reliant on psychiatry and Big Pharma meds. It’s how to pass your time in the hospital system. One aims to be as active as possible and all It seems you can physically do as a patient is sit and smoke cigarettes. It’s no wonder that drug use is becoming ever more prevalent inside mental hospitals as people are genuinely bored and need to occupy their time in some way. Judith Paget incidentally promised to get me in a consultation meeting with the heads of OT for the Trust and to suitably increase funding in their direction. Instead she brushed me aside, ignored her promise and cut back more funds and saved more money by binning OT which she obviously deemed a non-essential luxury.
In general, human rights for mental patients need to be improved. I worry about the scrapping of the human rights Act and how it will affect mental patients. There are a few safeguards I’ve noticed in use in the tribunal courts which do protect certain interests of patients. In general, there is a massive stigma attached to mental illness and perhaps the worst part of being diagnosed and treated is how the community and society change to treating you as an individual. It is a difficult period for patients and their families and friends. This is made worse by the massive stigma and misunderstandings associated with mental health. I think that it all begins with the vast divide between staff and patients within hospital systems. Too many fundamental freedoms and rights are taken away from inpatients. If one is being treated like a subhuman one will feel like a subhuman. Mental hospitals become, not healthcare environments,but punishment centres. They are prisons for the disaffected. Most patients I have spoken to who have experience of both the prison service and mental hospitals actually prefer prisons as they have more freedom there and it is more like normal life inside. They can have jobs and tvs and do what they wish during association hours. Mental hospitals, and you must try visiting Talygarn and St Cadoc’s to see this, are dark and dismal places often threadbare with so little to do for patients. Facilities are dilapidated, often broken and rarely repaired. If mental health is to be treated on a parity with physical health then surely the environment of the hospital can be improved. Rights are taken away. Mobile phones are confiscated, or mobile phone chargers. Cigarette lighters are confiscated. You can’t drink caffeinated coffee. Takeaways are banned. Are these rules fit for patients or fit for prisoners?
As the last twenty years have gone by I have noticed how freedom within the community, within the hospital itself, has slowly been tightened up. Twenty years ago, patients would wake in St Cadoc’s, have a cooked breakfast, do the crossword together in OT, and disappear to Caerleon town to trawl around the pubs all day. You could freely walk around the beautiful countryside grounds and vistors could come and go as pleased. Nowadays, you are more likely to walk onto the ward after some leave, forced to submit to a full body search and have a breathalyzer to test you for any signs of alcohol. Your visitors have to stay outside the entire ward and can only come at certain times. You cannot simply walk out into the grounds for a bit of fresh air. These hospitals are now heavily policed by the staff that have become warders as opposed to nurses. As smoking bans enter the fray, staff can no longer socially smoke with patients and talk about their problems. It adds to further separation between staff and patient and ultimately when the smoking ban is enforced life for an involuntary smoking patient will be a nightmare as they will be forced to quit on the spot and that is unhealthy. If the aim is to get patients into the community they need to be able to have trust built in that community from as early a stage as possible. Mental Health systems should be about lifting barriers, not erecting them. There is enough stigma in the real world without stigma inside the hospital system.
There is a major problem in justice for mental patients. The current tribunal system is very unfair and far too heavily weighted in favor of psychiatrists. For a start one of the three board members of a Tribunal is a psychiatrist. There is an unhealthy backlog of delay in the Tribunal system meaning that you often have to wait several months under treatment (against consent) in hospital following your appeal being lodged prior to the Tribunal sitting. Solicitors are hard pressed and often very impotent in terms of what actual assistance they can give you. The hospitals are full of people living in hope about their appeals yet on average only about 5% of appeals are ever successful for patients. I feel that similar to the criminal justice system, prior to being locked away you should get your chance in front of a court for them to decide if the psychiatrist is right in saying you need to be detained under section. It is only reasonable for this to happen.
Police have become a lot more involved in mental health – Cells are being used to hold patients prior to them being transported to hospital. Often patients’ first contact with services is via the police, police transportation being used instead of ambulances and handcuffs and, worse still, tasers are routinely used on mental patients. The last thing you expect as you enter a healthcare environment is to be shot in the chest by a police marksman. I have been the victim of a taser attack in my own home and it severely traumatised me. Again, are we treating health or is this just a form of social control for disciplining the marginalized and disaffected.
Police have no role in healthcare. When you need to use the police as a patient they will ignore you and they routinely ignore some of the worst crimes perpetuated by staff in mental hospitals. The training of the police re mental health needs to be completely overhauled and they need to distance themselves as a system as a whole from the mental health sector if we are ever to achieve parity between mental and physical healthcare.
Training needs to be revamped and brought into the twenty-first century. Antiquated ideologies need to be erased. I find that most mental health workers appear to have a glazed sense of brainwash about them. They are conditioned into distancing themselves from the mentally ill, into building barriers. They are oversold the pharmaceutical benefits of the drugs and are misled, like doctors, by drug company marketing material, false claims and the vast profits that multi-billion dollar industry generates.
Lastly, does it really need to be said that the system should not be employing criminals. Often psychiatry and the industry attracts some dark people in its workforce. There are far to many with brutal prison-warder type mentalities who get their kicks out of oppressing others. And psychiatrists are not always the sanest and most reasonable people. I was appalled to learn that my psychiatrist of two years had a history of child sex offences. Dr Darryl Watts was employed by Aneurin Bean UHB after spending 30 hours a week surfing child pornography on the internet whilst working as a psychiatrist in Bristol. He was convicted, struck off and the later employed to work in a position of responsibility. He is unfit to judge the sanity of others in my opinion and this is a clear scandal.

Last summer I was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. After two months or so in hospital I won my appeal against section in the Mental Health Review Tribunal Courts. I now have no psychiatric treatment and am a free man. I used my time in hospital to gather as much documentary evidence as possible and have reproduced in this blog post here my fight for justice. I wrote letters of complaint on an almost daily basis and am still dealing with the matter via the Ombudsman, my MP and Welsh Assembly Member plus the Minister of Health for the Welsh Government. If you are a detained mental patient I suggest that you fight in a similar manner and document your case as the results are apparent. I typed up all the documentation from handwritten letters photocopied in hospital and reproduce them here.I also submitted all my documentation to the Tribunal courts. ENJOY THE LITANY OF COMPLAINTS! (and responses)
I am sure that you remember me Judith. I have previously written umpteen complaints to you regarding the abominable health treatment I receive from employees of your Trust. Most of the time these complaints achieve nothing other than generating even more animosity between staff and myself. I am a patient and thus an end user of the service. I expect to be treated like a human being at all times by Aneurin Bevan UHB employees.
I have been out of hospital since November, being discharged from section in January. My consultant psychiatrist was changed from Dr Basu to Dr Attwood. I was put under the care of the Abergavenny-based Assertive Outreach team with most of the outreach work being supervised by Freya Crowley. Since November I have kept my nose down and used the time out of hospital for recovery. I was severely traumatized by the torture I experienced on Talygarn and PICU and I haven’t been up to much at all. My fundamental aim is to stay out of hospital. I have received visits from AOT on a weekly basis, changing that at my request to fortnightly about two months ago. Dr Attwood has been out to visit me twice. I do prefer him to Dr Basu who quite frankly is an insane clown, yet I still wouldn’t trust Attwood as far as i could kick him and he has already threatened me with long term hospitalization for my next admission. I guess it’s the lesser of two evils.
I was removed from my university studies at Cardiff – Translation (BA) – to be incarcerated in your mental health system. I do prefer education to being part of a sick human experimentation where anything goes. However, it was deemed by the authorities that it was better for me to while away my time in hospital. I will be returning to the second year of my course in September at which point I will be severing all ties with mental health workers to focus on my goals of achieving a degree – something I have been trying to do since 1997 when I was initially removed from study. Over the past month I have started to become more outgoing and active. I completed a university assessment for the course I missed whilst in hospital and achieved a 75% mark – a first class honours. I started quite heavy exercise, returning to the gym and attending various martial arts classes. I also began t read heavily and reignite my websites. I am taking things at a steady pace despite the increase in useful activity. To do well in university I need to be as fit and healthy as possible and sitting around like a mental health couch potato is not a good way to prepare for the challenge ahead.
Freya from Assertive Outreach has been devolving her responsibilities as my primary carer and sending out junior members of the team, including students. I had two junior members from AOT attend my home last Tuesday. I don’t know their names as they are all strangers to me and there are so many people on this AOT team. From the outset of our meeting they were both hostile. It was obvious that they weren’t in the best of moods. I stopped what I was doing and paid attention to them. They were just conducting a fascist style interrogation, totally nitpicking at anything I said and inferring that I was mentally ill.I recognized their game and resisted but it didn’t matter what I said they had made up their minds. This is despite the fact that all of my friends and family and everyone else in society have been remarking on how well I’m doing and how they are glad to see me finally getting back involved in the community and my life. I realize that any change from being a mental health couch potato might strike AOT as being odd, but it is not my aim to be totally subjected to the totalitarianism of the mental health act. I do intend to live a good, healthy life in spite of constant oppression by your employees and Gwent Police.
The two members of AOT went away and my partner Nicola and I were instantly frightened. We spent the rest of the day jumping out of our skins when a car pulled up outside our home, worried sick that it was a police snatch squad. I have cancelled all my activity with martial arts and going to the gym and cannot concentrate on reading. My suspicions of the team’s intent were proved correct this morning. I received a worrying phone call from Freya Crowley dictating to me that the team were concerned about my mental health and how Dr Attwood’s underling doctor (some Asian sounding name) was going to be making an emergency visit. Now this set all the alarm bells ringing. I stayed calm on the phone and informed Freya that I would be receiving no emergency visit as my mental health was fine. I explained that the two women from AOT last Tuesday were out of order and misconstruing evidence. I said to Freya that if she insisted a doctor attend it could be done on the next scheduled fortnightly visit when I expected to see her. I also stipulated that it should be Dr Attwood in attendance and that he should not be diffusing responsibility to his junior doctor.
I am now sat at home, absolutely petrified about the forthcoming week and whether or not I will retain my liberty. I did immediately phone my solicitor Neil Confrey, for advice. He instructed me to remain calm with these halfwits when they do turn up.
I want to know why it is that, technically a free man, I am subjected to what is tantamount to Cartel-like intimidation in my home. If I was being stalked by the Sicilian Mafia the maybe I should expect to live in fear. These are your employees, supposedly having a mandate for healthcare. They induce poor health in people, through their lack of training and irresponsible behaviour. Yes, they have done this many many times over the years but this does not mean that the cycle will perpetuate forever. I can assure you that I will break this cycle and live unmolested in a normal fashion, contributing to society in my own way, using choice and democracy in my actions. I have been taught how not to behave as a human being through prolonged exposure to your workers. They treat me like a piece of dog shit, with total disdain, with no respect for my human rights. I am a piece of meat to these captors, someone who can be chucked away and forgotten while they go home on their comfy wages and bliss out in front of the television.
It’s got to stop somewhere Judith – You have to learn to leash up your workers, to keep them under control. I will not and will never submit to the authority of the mental health services in South East Wales and I will continue to honour the values that I held as a young man prior to 1997 when this nightmare began. You may get away with it every time but some day somebody somewhere will put a stop to my torture.
I expect this complaint to be dealt with promptly and effectively with suitable disciplinary measures instilled.
Ps. as a result of all this mayhem I have managed to produce two new articles on the End Of Terror website that I think you should be reading http://endofterror.org
This letter follows on from my complaint from several weeks ago. I received a response saying that you had up to six months to investigate this complaint. I find this unacceptable.
Since I wrote the complaint there has been follow up from your workers and I have subsequently been detained at Talygarn under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act. This entire detention is due to the fallout from the aggression displayed by AOT in my home. I have already missed a year of my university studies due to Dr Basu, Dr Al Hasani and the care teams (now including Dr. Attwood). Being sectioned on 29th July means that a tribunal will not convene for at least two months. My university studies are due to resume on 22nd September 2016.
I have had enough of your mental health teams disrupting my life. I do not wish to sit at home, on the unemployed fringes of society, a static target for aggressive mental health practitioners. Whenever, I seemingly begin to piece my life together and enter mainstream society, your teams attack. It is nothing but psychiatric enslavement to which I am subjected. It has to stop.
The AOT team’s report from that initial aggressive visit was riddled with fantasy, Dr Attwood invented an incident, accusing me of sending beheading videos via Facebook to my sister in Australia. This is utterly false and both my sister and I have refuted Attwood’s claims. Social worker Linda Price needs disciplining, as do Al Hasani and Basu. They are just targeting me without reason. My mental health is in perfect condition and it is shambolic how I am detained. This situation will continue to escalate and I will resist and attack Aneurin Bevan UHB Trust through endofterror.org until I achieve satisfaction.
Surely, it is better to quit the harassment of me and to allow me to pursue my Translation (BA) studies at Cardiff University in peace?
I copied in my MP, Jessica Morden and AM, John Griffiths, to the original complaint and am hoping to achieve an independent political solution to my woes.
I wish for you to consider the escalations that have occurred and indeed will continue to occur as a result of my original complaint. I will not serve the doctors, nurses, social workers, willingly, when they are denying me all rights to function in the community as a human being.
Something must be done, and done swiftly, Judith. And you know that you have the power and capacity, to enact change. I implore you to finally act on this saga that continues to spiral out of control.
As you are well aware I am a detained Section 3 patient at Talygarn Ward. Last week when Dr Al Hasani detained me he promised that I would have overnight leave at home with my partner and nearest relative, Nicola Edwards. Dr Al Hasani has now reneged on that promise. His superior Dr Basu has allowed me 4 hours leave daily. I was told that I could go home for those four hours. Obviously with Caldicot being a forty-five minute drive away, this four hours is not particularly suitable. I need, however, to be at home, to look after my partner, to recover from hospitalization, and to prepare for my return to university in September. On leaving the ward round meeting, I asked Keith Sullivan, Deputy Ward Manager, for a lift home to Caldicot, Keith Sullivan flatly refused so my leave will not be facilitated. There is no excuse for this.
I am being held under false pretenses. I have no health issues. After what transpired last year when Basu ignored the court ruling about my discharge, causing me to miss a full year of university, I demand now a full investigation into my case.
Following on from my complaint earlier today regarding the failure of my four hour leave to Caldicot being facilitated, I write another complaint, specifically about Deputy Ward Manager, Keith Sullivan.
Firstly, I am disgusted that you continue to employ this imbecile of a man. It seems that every complaint about him is simply ignored. Healthcare to me is about providing a decent medical service and at all times your staff should be trained to be polite and courteous. Even if, like Keith, they hold personal grudges, professionalism from nurses (and doctors) is what the end user of your service expects.
As I couldn’t go to Caldicot, I went out for a couple of hours, a walk in the rain to Pontypool town centre, to meet with local friends. I returned to the ward after two hours, in time for my evening meal.
Keith Sullivan opened the doors to me, was instantly in my personal space, and demanded to conduct a full body search. Now, I have been a patient within the Aneurin Bevan UHB Mental Health services for 19 years. On PICU, they do conduct a fairly thorough search, but it is a new thing to me that full searches are now condoned on acute wards. I have watched people come and go with no such search occurring, and never, in 19 years, has one been demanded of me. I simply refused point blank, clearly expressing my views to Mr. Sullivan and accusing him of unnecessary animosity.
I am unsure of what disciplinary measures might be taken against me. I demand fair treatment. I am sure that hostile notes will be recorded in my medical file, more ammunition for Messrs Attwood, Basu and Al Hasani, no doubt. But, how is a full body search contributing to my healthcare and wellbeing? I find it intrusive, invasive and unsettling to my mental health. What I want, is for Keith Sullivan’s animosity to be nipped in the bud. I would prefer it if he was fired, or when I am a patient on Talygarn, that he is transferred to a different ward for employment. I think that he is a petty little dictator , on a power trip that needs to be curbed.
I am writing to you to request a complete change in the medical staff caring for me. I wrote to you last year to remove Dr Basu and Dr Al Hasani from my care team yet nothing was done. The problem still therefore exists and this year I want it to be rectified.
Both Dr Basu and Dr Al Hasani are totally incompetent. They do not carry themselves as medical professionals and are overtly hostile to me in every aspect of my care. They are ‘extreme psychiatrists’, constantly medicating against consent and placing me on the highest possible maximum doses available to them. They withhold my leave and do not take into account my partner’s wishes. Incidentally, my partner, Nicola Marie Edwards, my fiancée, with whom I have lived for fourteen years, as my nearest relative, has been denied her right, under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act, to have me discharged. This is illegal.
Basu and Al Hasani are hostile to the point of being racist. They will never discuss the symptoms they believe me to suffer from and they openly lie, Dr Basu stating last year at a tribunal that I believed President Obama was my best friend. These doctors are liars, are irresponsible, and shouldn’t be allowed to practice at all, let alone lord over me with their ‘mighty’ powers.
Dr Basu and Al Hasani totally ignored the tribunal verdict last year which stipulated that I should be immediately released on a CTO in order for me to resume my second year of a Translation (BA) at Cardiff University. Instead they held me for the maximum 6 month duration of the Section 3. I therefore missed a whole year of my education program and now they have me again in hospital it looks likely I will have to defer my studies for another year. They are constantly putting every possible obstacle in my path and fail to recognize me as a fellow human being. They seem to perversely get kicks out of their treatment of me, often giggling in my face when they do something negative to me, knowing full well they will get away with it. They are rude, insolent and have no place in yor Trust as ‘responsible’ clinicians.
I also request that Dr Attwood be removed from my care in the community. I wish to apply for him to be struck off and will be contacting the GMC myself at the earliest available opportunity. Dr Attwood has lied to have me placed under section. He has stated that my sister, Melanie Powell, in Australia, contacted him to complain about me sending her ‘beheading videos’ on Facebook. This is a complete manifestation, a delusion on the doctor’s behalf. My sister has sent me a written statement for the courts, stipulating that she has never had contact with Dr Attwood, nor have I ever sent her beheadings videos. Beheadings videos are something I do not dwell upon. In fact, my only knowledge of them comes from the Daily Mail and Bristol Post articles on Dr Darryl Watts, who in addition to his addiction to child pornography, also had a fetish for snuff movies. I find it very bizarre how the devious psychiatrists involved in my care could plot so wickedly. Both Basu and Al Hasani seem satisfied that Dr. Attwood speaks the truth and are treating me with full force based on his imaginary evidence. The scandal involved in my care continues to grow and will provide rich material in my endofterror.org campaign against Aneurin Bevan University Health Board Trust.
I ask you how I am supposed to put faith in the professional opinions of this trio of second-rate doctors, when they so openly and blatantly lie? They may fool the courts and indeed yourself and the managers with their lies, but I assure you, that they do not pull the wool over my eyes. These men are heinous and deserve proper disciplinary action, bans from practicing and prolonged retraining. I simply refuse to accept their authority or judgments.
In addition to requesting a fully fresh team of psychiatrists, I also want rid of the Assertive Outreach Team involved in my outpatient care. I asked for them to be removed and to have Elen Macelroy, Hywel Dda social worker, to replace them. Under the guidance of Jackie Lewis they are irresponsible and hostile. They should act with more compassion in their duties and not be antagonistic and hostile. They are prepared to lie to further the goals of their psychiatrist masters.
I hope that you will swiftly replace the aforementioned medics and care teams so that the substandard service I currently receive can be upgraded to some proper professional NHS care. Incidentally, I am still waiting to see psychologist John Baird after Perry Attwell ordered Dr Basu, last year, to arrange an appointment with him for me.
I apologize for sending you a stream of letters from my captivity in Talygarn. I feel I am bringing important issues to your attention, however. Please respond in writing. If perhaps, there wasn’t a situation here of ZERO occupational therapy then maybe I’d have other constructive things to do. When yourself, Perry, Nicola and I sat down for an hour’s meeting about two years ago, I am disappointed to record that nothing at all came of that meeting. ZERO results. As Chief Executive, I remind you of your duties to service users. You have the power to implement change for the better, and you should use that power wisely. Please bring the second rate medics involved in my care into line so that you can ease my pain as a disgruntled service user.
I have already written to request a change of consultant. This letter of complaint provides more detail on the lackluster service that Dr Basu has provided me during my most recent detention. There have been no fewer than five meetings already between Basu and me. On every occasion I have asked the doctor to inform me of the symptoms he believes I am suffering from. I have also asked him to provide me with information about my future studies at Cardiff University. Being a detained patient in his care, I feel that I have a right to know his medical opinion, also how his plans are going to affect my future life and career. Basu is constantly evasive and just deflects to Dr Attwood, saying he was responsible for detaining me and it has nothing to do with Basu. Having heard this exact same argument used on five occasions I realize that Basu intends to pursue this course, like a stuck record. I have been under close observation for two weeks and as far as I’m concerned have made no slip ups. Surely, Basu must have some form of symptoms recorded or am I simply not suffering from the mental illness that he diagnoses? I am supposed to be beginning the second year of my Translation (BA) course at Cardiff University on September 22nd 2016. Obviously, this will only be possible depending on Basu’s plans for my care. Basu doesn’t seem to recognize at all just how important this course is to me. His actions last year, when he deliberately flouted an MHRT court ruling about me being discharged, have already caused me to postpone my studies for a year. I find Basu’s outright refusal to discuss university as a breach of his medical responsibilities. I would rather some form of negative indication from him than deliberate evasive prevarication. I have been liaising with Cardiff University and also my Assembly Member, John Griffiths. Both parties are keen to learn about what provisions are being made for the continuation of my studies.
I will not continue to accept Basu being ignorant and simply burying his head in the sand when my whole life and future depends on the decisions he is making. He provides a dismal service and should not be placed in a position of responsibility at all, especially not involving me.
Basu has frozen all my leave, refusing to extend it beyond four hours daily and I don’t even get these four hours due to the constant excuses about staffing levels, despite Perry Attwell assuring me that the complaint I previously informed you about, would be resolved, and I would get my full leave.
This is another complaint about Deputy Ward Manager of Talygarn, Keith Sullivan. On Sunday, 7th August, I had arranged with the morning staff for a lift home to Caldicot for my four hours leave. Keith Sullivan was the nurse in charge of the afternoon shift. I asked Keith to facilitate my lift home and he replied that there was a staff shortage and this wouldn’t be possible, despite there being an over-abundance of working nurses. I explained that Perry Attwell had said, when resolving a previous complaint, that when staff couldn’t facilitate transport, the ward would pay for taxi fares. Keith informed me that he would not pay for taxis. I decided to ring Perry Attwell, as I have his private number. I felt bad contacting him during his weekend time off, but had no alternative. I put Perry on the phone to Keith and luckily afterwards Keith provided transport although I was only allowed home for two hours.
What annoyed me the most was that when Keith refused initially, I requested some paper from him to write a complaint. Keith refused to give me paper from the office saying that he wouldn’t let me complain about him. He sadi that he didn’t care what Judith Paget might say, adding that he was leaving the trust soon anyway, and didn’t care if he was fired so my complaints about him were irrelevant. I do not believe that someone with such a ‘laissez-faire’ attitude should be employed by the Trust.
I am sure, Judith, that you are aware of http://endofterror.org This is my company and is set up to promote better practice in psychiatry. It has run for a number of years now, and increasingly I am finding that it is under direct threat from Mental Health workers in your system. Dr Basu began targeting it last year, suspending content from being posted by ordering the initial monitoring and then confiscation of my mobile internet devices. This year has proved no different. In Friday’s Doctor meeting, where Perry Attwell, Manager, was present, Basu ordered that should, over the duration of the weekend’s home leave, I post on @endofterror twitter or do a full website blog post, then my leave will be immediately rescinded and I will be recalled to hospital and have future leave revoked. I get a lot of support from the public, politicians and journalists through End Of Terror and I find it therapeutic. I feel that Dr Basu is acting illegally by directly confronting this business. He is breaching ‘freedom of speech’ legislation and I should be free to use the Internet how I choose, in particular in my own home. Apparently social worker, Linda Price, who classifies my 14 year relationship as a delusion, objects to me tweeting about her, having put in an official complaint. It is interesting to note that, from her holiday, she manages to monitor the @endofterror tweets, yet she is unable to address her boss, Steve Woods, or my solicitor, Mr. Confrey, as to the role of my nearest relative. The nearest relative is of course my partner, Nicola Edwards, by law, even if Linda Price illegally claims otherwise. The fact of the matter is that my whole detention is provably illegal yet Linda Price wants to continue to flout her power and illegally clamp down on legitimate business activities. ie. End Of Terror.
I would like for you to formally write to me to inform me of how and why the Mental Health Act can be used to suppress freedom of speech on the Internet. I would like all conditions on my internet usage to be lifted and for Dr Basu and Linda Price to be reprimanded.
I thank you, in advance, for responding to this complaint hastily and with the full force of your executive powers.
I am currently being injected with 50mg Modecate fortnightly on Dr Basu’s orders. This is treatment against my consent. I am allergic to Modecate like I am with every other depot injection. I am vomiting 15-20 times a day and cannot focus at all to do my studies. I cannot eat due to the vomiting and the sickness I have from this treatment is incredible. When you factor in that Dr Attwood has initially lied and made up my symptoms prior to treatment, I trust that you will empathize with my view that a healthy individual has been taken and made sick by mental health treatment.
I have tried explaining these symptoms to Dr Basu so that something can be done but Basu just brushes them aside saying that I must have an underlying physical sickness and he tries to refer me to the GP. Both Nicola and I know from multiple previous occasions that it is the depot medication treatment causing this sickness as once the depot stops the sickness disappears. Also, the GP, Dr P Gedman, will do nothing to stand up to the psychiatrists. He may be able to prescribe some gastro-intestinal medication such as Olanzoprazole to help ease the pain of vomiting but he will not stop the psychatrists from pursuing their depot medication goals, goals which I truly do not comprehend. In the past both neurologists and gastro-intestinal specialists have concluded that my illness is due to the depot injections and that they should be stopped but psychiatrists act as a law unto themselves.
I want Basu disciplined for failing to deal with the sickness he is causing me through his treatment. I am supposedly being discharged on Tuesday so hopefully these depot injections will stop at that point and I will be able to regain my lost fitness and resume my studies at Cardiff University. The psychiatrists should not be allowed to inflict pain and torture upon their patients.
For the past two weeks in ward round meetings Dr Basu has been giving me today’s date as a final discharge date. My partner, Nicola Edwards, had a meeting regarding her role as nearest relative, with social services manager, Steve Woods, at Hywel Dda Centre, Chepstow, last Wednesday, where Steve stated that the nearest relative problem would be redundant as of today as Basu intended to discharge me, thus making the position of nearest relative irrelevant.
What actually transpired at today’s meeting was that rather than discharging me, Basu instead revoked all my leave and, after spending the past two weeks or so at home, I have been forcibly redetained in Talygarn, with no leave even to the local shop. I want to know why Dr Basu has lied outrightly to Nicola, Steve Woods and myself. I am supposed to be attending university on 19th September and any plans I make towards this goal are thwarted by Dr Basu and Dr Attwood. Dr Attwood was indeed present at today’s meeting which I believe did not help the situation. Attwood accused me of being aggressive which is a falsehood as it was him and Basu that reduced my partner to tears in the meeting. Attwood claims that I am prepared to complain about anything. He dismissed my complaints as nonsensical and openly mocked me. When I told Attwood that I had applied to the General Medical Council (GMC) for him to be struck off he accused me of threatening him.
Are the Aneurin Bevan doctors that powerful that they are exempt from any complaints procedure? Are they above the auspices of the GMC? Who will rein in their misperceived omnipotence?
The reason given for my renewed detention were that Doctor Attwood disbelieves that I am vomiting 15-20 times a day on the current 50 mg Modecate depot injection. He said that he didn’t want me claiming this at tribunal and I was to be kept in hospital to ‘prove my vomit’.
I have a sick bowl at home and the care of a trained nurse in Nicola. I have been doing well back in the community and completely begrudge being held here just to satisfy Basu and Attwood’s curiosity. Since I was readmitted this afternoon I have vomited 9 ties which has been documented by staff yet it wasn’t until I saw Dr Rankin later in the day that some form of medical examination was attempted. Basu has actually increased the depot injection Modecate to 100mg for tomorrow, a doubling of the dose and the maximum dose allowed of this medication. Is this a wise medical decision? At some point I wish for medical ethics to be considered with regard to the aggressive ‘extreme psychiatry’ I experience at the hands of your doctors. After 19 years of treatment against my consent I fully appreciate how far psychiatrists are prepared to bend the rules and test the limits of their power.
Well, now I guess the question of my attendance at university has been settled. Your doctors have won for another year and have yet again thwarted my life plans.
As my partner correctly pointed out to Basu and Attwood, why now after 19 years of my allergy to depot injections causing me to vomit, have they suddenly decided it warrants close hospital observation? Why now am I detained, a such a critical point of my university preparations?
Two weeks ago when 50mg Modecate was injected against my consent, I went home and had a bad reaction. I started seeing shapes appear across the left side of my vision which clouded over, blocking my sight. I was hyperventilating and had to calm down in bed. I spent about an hour on the phone to NHS Direct who wanted to send an ambulance for me to be admitted to Accident & Emergency. I also experienced heart palpitations and irregularities. I just wish that when you use non-consensual treatment it wasn’t so damned dangerous and life threatening. The dosage of this drug has now been doubled so God only knows how badly I’ll be faring tomorrow. I’d love to know the medical justification of this.
I would like you to examine why Dr Basu lied about my discharge and also why they are becoming aggressive due to me utilizing the complaints procedure. I believe that doctors bullying patients is not the way forward for the NHS.
On Wednesday, 31st August, nurses Gabrielle Gwyther and Olu Alcanvo, administered, against my consent, 100 mg Modecate depot injection. I had asked them both to check with NHS direct about my symptoms from when 50mg was administered two weeks previously due to the bad reaction I had experienced. They refused to do this, stating that because the doctor had written it up they had to give it.
Ten minutes after the administration of the drug I had a seizure in the smoking area. It was consistent with the previous seizures I have had whilst on high doses of depot injection. Involuntary head movements and loss of control of my tongue. I reported the seizure immediately to Olu and Gaby and they just laughed in my face. Olu said he had been watching on the video camera and it wasn’t a seizure – presumably he thinks I faked it? He said that the medication was a long-acting drug and couldn’t possibly cause seizures of any kind, certainly not so quickly.
I went on to have three more minor seizures in the smoking area, some witnessed by patients. I went to the nurse’s station and they were all crowded around the TV monitors roaring with laughter. Olu, who couldn’t stop giggling said he was glad I was having seizures. I had no medial treatment whatsoever, and was refused access to the Ward doctor.
I find that the employment of staff who are prepared to openly laugh at your medical problems and do nothing at all to remedy your situation should be terminated. There is no excuse on this issue and I expect Olu and Gaby to both be fired.
I presume that yet again for another year I will not be referred to the neurologist. These psychiatric drugs are causing me brain damage which is what seizures indicate. It is a real shame that Aneurin Bevan are prepared to cause illness and then fail to treat the subsequent medical issues.
I wish to report Dr Basu for again wasting my time today, lying and leading me to false hope. After the fiasco two weeks ago when he had arranged to discharge me but failed to do so Dr Basu arranged for me to come in to his ward round today, telling me beforehand that he would be discharging me on a CTO, ahead of the resumption of my university studies on the 19th September. Following a prolonged meeting with Steve Woods, head of social services, Basu again decided to renege on his word and failed to discharge me. Basu was wanted to illegally subvert the conditions of the CTO whereby he could force me to take the depot injections with threat of hospital recall if I refuse. These are not mandatory conditions of a CTO and are non-mandatory additions he is making to subvert the Mental Health Act. I had intended to be free of the depot injections that make me so violently ill ahead of returning to university but now Dr Basu will be using the full powers of his under my Section 3 detainment to administer depot injections against my consent.
It is clear to me Judith that you are showing a blatant disregard for my complaints by the lack of haste you use in addressing them. Perhaps if Aneurin Bevan University Health Board’s complaints procedure was more robust and fulfilling, then maybe this whole nightmare scenario would by now be over. I do hope that you will seriously consider ALL my complaints as these doctors and staff who I complain about are free to do what they want at present to other patients and myself. These dissidents need to be brought into line.
I have received your response to my complaints dated 21 November 2016. Please excuse my tardiness in replying to your response as I have been completing my Autumn Term at Cardiff University. I have now finished for Christmas and have the time available to deal with this ongoing matter.
When I wrote you the litany of complaints it was in the hope of achieving some worthwhile change within the system that would benefit not just myself but other service users. I feel that your response was very light-hearted, lightweight and left virtually every issue I identified as unaddressed. It seems that you are not interested in the views of end users of the Mental Health Service and that you just wish to maintain the status quo of your staff treating patients in a subhuman inhumane manner. I have subsequently asked the Ombudsman to intervene and I’m sure he’ll be in contact in due course. I am also keeping my AM John Griffiths and MP Jessica Morden in the loop so I do not regard the matter as closed. Rather, having read your response I feel that something ought to definitely be done to address the local mental health system. You need to look from management down and address the fundamental building blocks that so fracture this system. If no change occurs when it has been clearly identified then the system is in an archaic state and that system will rust into disrepair. What you have in Talygarn and St Cadoc’s is a corrupt and decadent system where so much has been allowed by management to run out of control for years. This produces a very unhealthy environment for service users and one which cannot easily be fixed. Doctors, nurses, social workers, they all run amok and they all fully know that management will turn a blind eye to any misdeeds. The staff get lazy and decadent and do not devote their work to the end user. They are all looking out for number one, doing just enough for their jobs and protecting themselves, without sticking their heads on the line to question the flaws in the system and improve the local mental health units, to bring them into line for what twenty-first century hospitals should be.
When looking through your response I cannot see an individual point where you feel that I am correct and right in feeling aggrieved with the system. There are plenty of lapsadaisy excuses in your response, plenty of instances where you fully believe that the correct procedures were followed by your staff.
I was locked up for no reason at all, taken from my own home, put into a hospital cell and kept to fester at the amusement of Dr Basu and Dr Attwood for a period of months. I was taken out of preparations for my university course and removed from my loving relationship. If all this was just and good and necessary then why did the Mental Health Review Tribunal when it finally sat, find in my favor? You have to ask yourself a question at this point. If a court of law can find a problem then why cannot management find a problem? It’s not as if I didn’t persevere and put in a lot of hard work, whilst under duress in hospital, to produce the complaints in the first place.
The Assertive Outreach team began being aggressive with me at a prior meeting when Dr Attwood was not present yet you find that Dr Attwood had correctly identified mental illness in me. If you read the very first complaint I wrote to you, that clearly shows that Dr Attwood was not involved at that point as I wrote to you before we had met.
I was accused of sending beheadings videos to my sister and I have in writing evidence from my sister saying that this is a complete falsehood. Perhaps a woman claiming to be my sister rang the assertive outreach team but it certainly wasn’t Melanie. I cannot see how anybody is following a Professional Code of Conduct when they are creating fictitious false accusations. You’ve opened the door for mental health professionals to say just about anything about a prospective patient with no recriminations. This is so fundamentally wrong and such a critical point that I cannot accept being locked away for something I simply haven’t done nor would dream of doing. I can fully well see that the mental health system struggles with the digital age – the internet and social media – as do many other industries. Yet to allow people to invent fictitious facebook stories when evidence can be produced to back up any counter-claim, this is a bad omen for the future of your service.
I’m dragged halfway across Wales to your hospital, well away from my home, friends and family and yet it is satisfactory that I cannot have leave, unlike every other patient on the ward. Eventually after persisting I did get leave and was thankful but it is not an area where I should be fighting in the first place.
Keith Sullivan searched me fully or attempted to, knowing fully that he was doing it to just annoy me. This is t the purpose of a search and Keith searched no other patients or visitors entering the ward. Keith is cantankerous and abused his power fully when he was working for your system. A truly terrible embarrassment of a man and a nurse.
I do not wish to hear management excuses about why I cannot change physician. I want to see whatever physician I choose irrespective of their workload or other commitments or whether or not they fancy the challenge of dealing with me. I feel it is a right for a patient in any form of healthcare to choose their doctor. In mental health where treatment against consent predominates it seems as though the doctors are the ones with the true power to choose their patients. This is wrong. I do not recognize either Dr Basu or Dr Attwood as responsible clinicians or indeed as my responsible clinician.I will refuse or future contact with both men and their vile, despicable treatments. You have to provide doctors for patients and not patients for doctors.
I think that the real reason nothing was followed up following our meeting two years ago is that you do not value patient input and couldn’t care a less for what an end user experiences in your system. You have a system that you are not interested in improving or you would be consulting all patients properly and adjusting the system according to the feedback. Mr Attwell may say that attempts were made t work with me but I can assure you that no attempts were made.
I struggled to cope in university all term as I missed out on the key preparation time I had identified that I needed prior to attending university as I was experiencing yet another Talygarn debacle.
Linda Price told me I’d been detained for sending beheadings videos and that was that. Basu or Attwood both denied to open up to explain further why I had been detained. This is deeply unsatisfactory and is a situation where each of the protagonists is lending a hand to help the other out during the investigation. If passing the buck satisfies your management criteria then so be it,but I feel that a large NHS Trust should be run professionally and the investigation should uncover sinister errors.
Nicola is a joint tenant fact. Whatever paperwork Linda Price may or may not have doe not justify ordering my partner out of her home. According to Linda Price, Nicola is not even my partner. It all fits conveniently when you weigh up how much my treatment depends on treatment against consent but in the real world Linda and her comrades should be disciplined for breach of professional ethics. I never want to see Linda Price anywhere near my home again. She is most certainly an unwelcome intruder.
How can my website be part of a mental health condition? Dr Basu should worry less about his name on the internet and worry more about his patients. Dr Basu had been stalking me online for some time and I have proven this despite his objections. You should supervise the use of the internet by psychiatrists. I need not bring up the example of Dr Darryl Watts to illustrate the necessity of this point.
I still have a critical hiatus hernia which is being untreated by the NHS, caused directly by Basu’s use of depot injections. His notes of a gradual improvement in mental health are medical proof that his treatment is good and works? Be a bit more scientific please. Since I’ve been off the injections my health has improved dramatically so that I can study and attend university. This would have been impossible had I stayed on the injections and lost in court. Basu and Attwood are old school in using depot injections as punishment for dissidents. Depot injections and treatment against consent are two of the biggest flaws in modern psychiatry and why it will never be a true science.
Dr Basu was breaching the law and this was clearly pointed out by Steve Woods as he tried to manipulate CTO law to hold me in his grasp. I truly thank God for my solicitor Mr Confrey, who was successfully able to steer the Tribunal into making a just and correct decision.
I would like you to look at my points and reassess your entire investigation as I feel that he first attempt at dealing with my complaints was most unsuccessful and leaves the service in a poorer state than it was before I was last admitted. People’s lives are on the line in a frontline mental health care environment and by Christ I’ve witnessed enough deaths within the system caused by the malpractice and neglect of clinical staff. It’s about time you brought this whole shambles of a system into the present age. This is not Bedlam and the people of South Wales shouldn’t have to accept the shambles that you run. I am truly thankful to be away from the system and hope never to return although I’ve a feeling that my detractors – the enemies in the system – are too much of a multitude for my stay away to be permanent.
This is a complaint about Monmouthshire Social Worker, Linda Price. Linda Price is an odious woman, who has harassed me using the Mental Health Act, over a number of years, consistently abusing her power. On 26/07/16, Linda Price, as AMP, attended my address and with the support of police and psychiatrists, removed me to Talygarn, where she subsequently sectioned me under the Mental Health Act. Linda Price identified my father as nearest relative, I believe deliberately. She knows that my parental relationship has broken down and that she can exercise her powers more with the support of my father, than if she had to seek the approval from my nearest relative, partner and fiancée, Nicola Marie Edwards. Nicola and I have lived together in a loving relationship for fourteen years and have been engaged for ten years. Under Mental Health Act law, as Nicola and I have been cohabiting for over six months prior to my detention, she is automatically classed as my nearest relative. Linda Price has told a massive lie that I uncovered today through speaking to Abergavenny-based social worker, Steve Woods. Linda claims that on 26/07/16, during a consultation with my partner, Nicola, that Nicola told her we weren’t in a relationship, we weren’t engaged and we had not been living together. This is pure fantasy on Linda’s behalf. It is not a simple oversight but a maliciously schemed plan to enforce the power granted to her by the Mental Health Act.
Linda Price made no attempt at a private consultation with Nicola on the 26/07/16 and indeed, after I had been removed from my property, ordered Nicola to leave the property, despite it being a joint tenancy in both our names. Nicola stayed at the property as she was rightly entitled to do.
Linda has persisted in insisting that Nicola is not my nearest relative and refuses to back down. This has created a whole host of problems with Mental Health Act Administration and also my legal team. I should have been discharged from hospital last Friday after Nicola applied for me to be released which is what she is entitled to do as my nearest relative under the Mental Health Act.
Linda Price needs disciplining. She should be forced to recognize my fourteen year relationship, be forced to apologize to Nicola and myself for lying, and should have all her responsibilities as an AMP removed, so that she may not perpetuate any further injustices as a social worker in Monmouthshire. I demand a full investigation into this abominable dragon of a woman and as any delay in investigation adds to the burden of my detention, I implore you to act speedily in resolving this issue.
I have a disputed diagnosis of schizophrenia and have lived with this diagnosis since 1997. For the past 18 months I have been banned from drinking more than two pints of beer in my local pub in Caldicot, the Castle Inn. This blog post will tell the story of how this ban came about and how I intend to fight for my rights to overturn the ban.
I had been sectioned and detained in the mental health system at Talygarn Ward, Griffithstown County Hospital, Pontypool. I spent several months locked up and was treated against my consent with Clopixol depot injections by the Muslim psychiatrist of Indian origin, Dr Basu and his sidekick the half-Iranian Dr Al-Hasani. When they finally released me from hospital I got home and went straight down to the Castle Inn for a quick pint to settle my nerves. Inside the mental hospital there is a ban on alcohol for all patients and they even breathalyse you with drink-drive breathalysers on your return from any leave to test if you have drunk any alcohol. The reasoning behind this is that mental health establishments treat a lot of alcoholics and alcohol is forbidden, even if, like myself, you have never had any issues with alcohol. I feel that alcohol is a decent recreational drug that is part of British culture and having worked in the entertainment industry my whole life I am well used to it and regard it as an essential part of my life. Landlord, Steve Gribble, refused to serve me a pint and said that the local police had, on my doctor’s advice, placed a ban on me drinking alcohol in my local community. Apparently alcohol doesn’t mix with my medication. I was absolutely disgusted by this. I felt that patient confidentiality had been breached and that my psychiatrist was unnecessarily interfering with my life in the community. I argued with Steve the landlord and put forth my views and he came together with a compromise that I would be allowed in his pub but had to stick to a two pint limit and leave. This ban has stayed in place now for 18 months and even at funeral wakes I have to leave after two pints. Landlord Steve Gribble and his wife Judy Gribble, are doing their jobs but I feel that they are breaching the Equality Act 2010 in their treatment of me. Under the Equality Act, public services are not supposed to discriminate against you for any form of disability.
I believe that I am being used as a guinea pig and that this new policy has not yet spread across the UK. The licensing trade is already suffering enough and is in a massive recession, with pubs closing their doors permanently like never before. The pub is a traditional British Institution and a cornerstone of our communities. Will mental health drugs be replacing alcohol as our method of relaxation? Will mental hospitals be becoming the new place for community hubs to exist? We are witnessing change with draconian mental health policies, backed up by the police and establishment. Mental Health is becoming an ever more buzz industry and although much of the public never see the inside of a mental health establishment, many are prescribed outpatient treatment, be it anti-depressants from their GP or over the counter sleeping tablets. At what stage will doctors cease to reveal to pub landlords private medical details such as a patient’s condition? If a visit to a doctor means that they will inform all and sundry about your health condition then where does this leave us? I am non-consensual to treatment and refuse medication as I do not believe I suffer from the diagnosed condition. Dr Basu is acting extra-judicially, out side of the law and I believe is in fact breaking the law. I am disappointed that Steve Gribble, a man who I admire and respect, has tolerated this open abuse of my healthcare.
Perhaps the ban has served me well and being minus alcohol is beneficial to my health. I feel, however, that pub landlords should be controlling the sale of alcohol to people with alcohol-related health conditions and they do continue to serve alcoholics in pubs across the land. I’ve decided to take the matter public and am pursuing a court case against the Castle Inn. I feel that my lone voice needs to be heard and that I need to warn the public about the sinister activities of the local southeast Wales mental health system who will stop at nothing to continually disrupt my life.

The authorities – local mental health workers and Gwent Police – are not happy with End Of Terror exposing their misdeeds. When I first started the website there was an immediate clampdown and I was ushered off into the Mental Health system. I later understood why my then Doctor, Dr Darryl Watts, was unhappy about being published on the internet as he had been convicted of child sex offences. It is convenient for the authorities to mask their repression and cover up End Of Terror. I think it important though, to expose this hidden system to the world and I certainly, over the years, have taken much refuge in the fact that End of Terror exists. It is a crutch of support to me.
2015 was a horrific year for me. I was taken into the hospital on no fewer than four occasions. It took me out of my undergraduate university studies at Cardiff University and set my life back again. After nineteen years in the mental health system it came as no real shock and i am used to dealing with the State disrupting my life. It is an asset to be resilient and to forge on with life plans in spite of the constant mental health harassment and its infringement upon my liberty.
During the last hospitalisation I was detained from July 2015 through to November. I was sat at home, minding my own business, doing work on the internet for my music business and out of the blue Dr Basu turned up with the police and a magistrate-signed warrant to remove me for assessment. I had done nothing whatsoever and was just carted off and incarcerated. Basu proceeded to give me the maximum dose of CloPixol Depot injection, something to which it has been proved I am allergic to. I had two stints on the secure PICU (Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit) Beechwood, St. Cadoc’s, Caerleon, for dissent on Talygarn Ward, Griffithstown County Hospital, Pontypool, where I was detained for the bulk of my stay.
My notoriety as a patient precedes me on Talygarn and on the ward I have some formidable enemies, usually within the nurse management structure. People who are constantly vying for their own selfish climb up the ladder whose disdain for patients is most cruel. I name Keith Sullivan, deputy ward manager, Jayne Hughes, former ward manager and Paul Hanna, Deputy Nurse Manager, to be among the most appalling of these ladder-climbing despots. They spend their days in a twisted Machiavellian power struggle, never hesitating to have a pop at patients using any means at their disposal to make their victims’ stays in hospital less comfortable. They are the antithesis of good nursing and miss the fundamental point that they are there to serve the patients’ needs. These are the prison warders whose radical oppression of patients and their rights truly epitomise the struggle within mental hospitals – the very examples of why there is such a divide between staff and patients.
One of the scariest movements within mental health hospitals is the inevitable ban they seek to impose on smoking. Anti-smoking lobbies have successfully campaigned across the board of the NHS for smoking to be restricted. Due to the enforced nature of sectioning, where patients are detained against their consent, smoking is still, on the whole, allowed inside mental hospitals. Smoking is one of the few things you can actually do to while away your time and most mental patients are heavy smokers. It upset me to see during my stay on Talygarn, that the inside smoking room had been closed and patients had been relegated to the garden area. It is one step closer to the achieved goal of a complete ban. Lighters were confiscated and the nurses had to be called to light your cigarette. This is one undignified way of removing patient’s human rights, but not the major subject of this article. I dread to think what it will be like in the future to be detained and forced to quit smoking instantly. There will be uproar within the services and most patients will struggle to come to terms with the ban.
Since the advent of mobile phones, patients have found new ways of staying in touch with the outside world during their incarceration. Although some parts of the system do deny access to mobiles eg.PICU, most acute wards allow patients to use their phones, although they often confiscate them at night and refuse patients the use of their chargers. This leads to a clandestine smuggling operation for patients whereby contraband chargers exchange hands on the ward so that everyone can top up their battery. Nurses spend their days lighting cigarettes and searching bedrooms for hidden mobile phone chargers – hardly constructive medical care?
Smart phones with internet are especially useful and to maintain social media accounts and have internet access is a godsend, especially to me. I have been able to update my EndOfTerror from within the confines of the establishment and being able to reach out to followers gives a certain empowerment. Being locked away from society is lonely and frustrating and although not freedom, internet access allows a certain maintenance of your outside life. Messages of encouragement from friends and family are invaluable to your disrupted mindset and as a patient the therapeutic value of support on the outside is immeasurable.
Resisting as ever, during my stay, I was actively tweeting on the @endofterror timeline. It’s rather difficult to do full blog posts from a mobile phone and tweeting is a handy alternative, even if the tweets just serve as a personal reminder of incidents once one gets back to the outside world. I regularly study social media activity of mental patients during detainment through online mental patient friends and although often disturbing in content I know that I am not alone in seeking solace through social media use during a section. Each individual has their own methods of reaching out.
The Indian Dr Basu and his underling, the Iranian Dr Al-Hasani, were being particularly virulent in their disdainful treatment of me. They simply failed to recognise me as a human being with human rights and used the treatment against consent to the maximum. They frustrated me by denying me any leave at all and I was forced to resort to criticising their actions on twitter. They were both monitoring my twitter use and the End Of Terror website and threatened me saying that I was not allowed to post anything about them or their names. This infringes upon my freedom of speech and expression and I simply refuse to bow down to fascism and change my policies of exposing the fault-lines of the mental health system. Prior to hospitalisation Dr Basu had been stalking me online and although he denies this, I caught him, through analytic software, studying my Linkedin and invading my personal space on the web. This adds to my conspiracy theory of how the actions of psychiatrists are preordained and not rooted in healthcare. My enemies will pursue me despite me having good health. The voice of dissent will be punished by the system and EndOFTerror is a nightmare scenario for my pursuers.
I started using the smartphone camera to take some visual images of the hospital surroundings. Most people fortunately never get to view the bare oppressive inside walls of a psychiatric hospital so it helps in exposing the realities inside. One night in the smoking area, where we were jovially listening to some music, I took a photo of some fellow patients, with, of course, their permission. I posted this photo on my personal networks (not end of terror). The psychiatric nurses and doctors who were glued to my social networks, looking for an excuse to pounce, did just this. They cited privacy rules and said that I had broken confidentiality rules and mobile phone policies and they confiscated my Iphone. I was up in arms. I said I would delete the offending photo but could not see what harm I had done. In the real world I am always updating my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram with all my escapades. Why should this be any different during a stay in hospital?
After many complaints the nurses came to a compromise and returned the mobile phone but they decided to do this with a twist and use an experimental policy. This experiment was horrendous to me and signified the extreme measures of state repression that little Hitlers within mental health services are prepared to use. I was allowed ten minutes of access to my mobile phone per shift and this access was to be supervised by a nurse. They wanted the inner workings of End Of Terror and were prepared to intimidate me into revealing my personal use of the internet. Nurses were quite uncomfortable with doing this and many expressed this to me. However, there are nurses who just relish the sort of power this experiment brings and jump at the chance of subverting patients’ rights. I found that my internet use was to be closely scrutinised and used in ways to justify my mental illness. Everything I did online found its way into my notes and was judged as mental illness. It’s just a total invasion of privacy and when you hear about internet repression in far off places such as China, to see this obsessive monitoring occurring in the UK just proved to me the State’s obsessiveness with surveillance.
Pretty soon, the ban on my phone use became compounded. I am a translation student at Cardiff University and use social media and the internet to maintain contact with a host of international friends and business associates across the world. The nurses started to complain as they could not understand my social media messages when I spoke in a foreign language. Therefore I was banned from speaking foreign languages and banned from internet contact with anyone outside of the UK. It is bad enough being prevented from studying your Translation degree, being forced to mss key lectures and examinations while you are subjected to the human experimentation of mental health. These authorities were now dictating to me that use of foreign language was a mental illness. I was being treated for my education skills and prevented in every way possible of exercising my study mindset. I found this to be ignorant, racist and typical of a stupid mentality. Why should my ways be changed to suit my captors?
Is it mentally ill and evil to contact people in the outside world and to use foreign languages? I was disappointed with the recent Brexit vote that demonstrated a democratic dislike for the EU and its foreign characteristics yet inside the mental hospital I witnessed some of the sickness of the system and how ignorant people could be. Right wing tendencies and oppression are key to the success of the mental health movement and where people have the right to exercise their power, I feel they often abuse this power, typical of the little Hitlers that so plague our fragmented society. Be it a police officer with a trigger-happy taser or a racist nurse, these people love mental health systems and what their roles in society entail. I feel sick that people can actively monitor my personal correspondence – most of the time it being innocuous contact with friends and family. I was forced to submit and to be honest dreaded my ten minute sessions on the phone. In a locked ward surrounded by cameras monitoring your every move, with your body given up to non-consensual mind-altering drugs, not being able to set foot on the grass or go to the pub for a pint, or even walk to the local shop, I felt that the monitoring of me could not possibly extend any further. Why does psychiatry have to be so intrusive? Do they really need to know every last detail of a patient? If they ever did anything useful with the information then I might be able to understand the medical necessity of information-gathering. However, the information is always misused and leads ultimately to further oppression.
Eventually, the whole charade cracked. While the nurses were running around lighting cigarettes, hunting down mobile phone chargers and peering over my shoulder at my Facebook messages, they obviously neglected their key role and jobs – that of nursing. An unmonitored patient slipped away to his room and hung himself with his dressing gown belt. Priorities should be given to prevent suicides and it is a nurse’s role to stop this happening. Suicides are sad affairs for all witnesses. I’d been close to the dead patient, sorting him out some tobacco and keeping his spirits high as he came to terms with his own incarceration yet he had gone ahead and done what he intended. All I did during my ten minutes of mobile phone usage that day, was to post an RIP message on my Facebook to my personal friends. It asks you how you feel on Facebook when you post a status. I was feeling sad about the suicide and posted so. Whenever somebody dies who I know, I tend to do a simple RIP message on Facebook. In the modern world of social media, many do this and I believe it is a key way of us dealing with grief as a society. The nurse who was monitoring me freaked out, tried seizing my phone and although I did post my status, I was reported to senior staff and my phone was permanently confiscated. Senior management were called to endorse this ultimate ban and despite my protests, Nursing manager Perry Attwell confirmed that my social media usage was not to be tolerated and the phone would remain in the possession of the Trust.
I do not know where monitoring and surveillance in society will ultimately lead but remember that the insides of mental hospitals where there is a captive population are very often where the most disturbing ideas in society are first trialled. Oppression begins in mental hospitals and they serve as a mirror to the realities and horrors of the real world.
Cardiff student tells of sectioning nightmare – from Gair Rhydd – Cardiff University student newspaper
A mature student has revealed to Gair Rhydd details of eighteen turbulent years as a mental health patient.
Wesley Gerrard, 37, is currently studying Translation at Cardiff University’s School of Modern Languages – but for nearly two decades his academic career has been disrupted by a series of detainments.
Gerrard claimed that his extensive experiences with the system have been far from positive and provoked him to set up the campaign site ‘endofterror.org’. The site aims to raise awareness of his experiences – but this in itself has brought him problems.
“As soon as I started publishing stories on ‘endofterror’, I’ve had major police involvement. I came to realise it was dangerous to publish this sort of thing,” he said.
In all, the part-time DJ claimed to have been sectioned under the Mental Health Act on “fifteen to twenty” occasions.
He claimed that his encounters with mental health services started when he was studying for an undergraduate degree in Geography at University College London in 1997.
“I ran into some trouble in London and when I came home, my parents forced me to go to an outpatient appointment.
He said that he was discouraged from undertaking further education by the fact that they “wouldn’t let me out of hospital to complete my exams [and] sectioned me whilst I was preparing my dissertation”.
Despite this, he re-entered higher education with the Cardiff Centre for Lifelong Learning in around 2008, and subsequently progressed to undertake a full degree.
However, he still had encounters with mental health authorities – until an academic “would not accept me pulling out of classes and put me in touch with disability advisor.”
“They said: ‘enough is enough, we’re not going to have this student’s life ruined anymore’. It made me very happy knowing I was going to get some protection from Cardiff University.”
The University’s intervention reportedly caused the mental health authorities to “lay off me”, and despite averaging a sectioning a year he came to an agreement with mental health authorities “not to disrupt his studies for three years”.
However, over the festive period he once again found himself incarcerated at St. Caldcot’s Hospital – and was accused by the authorities of having delusions over his status as a Cardiff University student.
“I tried getting hold of student support but they were away on Christmas break, something my tutor was not happy about,” Gerrard said.
“In the end I managed to get a phone call through, and said ‘I’m in an emergency situation, can you implement the emergency plan to help me out?’”
“They didn’t do anything they’d agreed to. I felt really betrayed by Student Support and Cardiff University,” he claimed.
He alleged that despite showing official ID, it fell to a number of Cardiff University students on placement to confirm his identity.
He subsequently won a tribunal against the National Health Service relating to his treatment over the Christmas period.
He claimed that although his personal tutor continues to be “really supportive”, he was disappointed that “there was nothing directly from the University.”
Gerrard made a number of claims regarding his treatment that we are unable to publish here, but continues to detail his experiences on endofterror.org.
A Cardiff University Student Support spokesperson said that “quite obviously we can’t comment on individual cases, even if the student has opted to speak to you”.
“In such situations it is our aim to ensure that Cardiff University students continue to have access to the facilities here which are designed to aide them with whichever problems they might be experiencing,” they added.

Let me introduce a new character on the doctor front. Dr. Agniezsca Tyson, or Agi, is a Polish female acute psychiatrist employed by Aneurin Bevan University Health Board. She works out of the Hywel Dda Centre in Chepstow and is head of psychiatry for Lower Monmouthshire. She is also a lecturer in Psychiatry at Cardiff University thus bringing the new generation of mental health employees up to scratch. Agi has a command role within the local police and they have to attend regular briefing and meetings at Hywel Dda. I think she relies far too heavily on the fear factor her surname induces with it also being that of the fearsome world champion boxer, Mike Tyson. A world champion, Agi isn’t.
I was transferred to Tyson against my consent after the previous Sri Lankan psychiatrist managing me, Dr. Nirmalie Mirando, retired. Never keen, as the Chepstow shrinks are usually a lot worse than the Newport ones and the general staff they employ are totally militant and more obnoxious than the average mental health worker. Almost automatically I ended up feeling the full force of Tyson. I filed multiple reports of attempted murder against her with the police and over the several years she acted upon me it was a truly frightening experience. Eventually, Tyson transferred me into the care of convicted child sex offender Gwent Police-employed forensic psychiatrist, Dr Darryl Watts (see category http://endofterror.org/?cat=191 ). I was ‘under’ her from around 2006-2010 and fought every second of the way to be transferred away from her grasp.
When my partner, Nicola, lost our unborn child in the womb (due to her enforced mental health drug treatment regime), we decided we would bring some life into our home by getting some family pets. A kind neighbour gave us our first hamster, ‘Rafa’ or ‘littly’. I bought a nice cage complex for our living room and our friends and us had hours of fun with a whole mass of roaming Roborovsky dwarf hamsters. Yes, our front room became the Gobi desert away from home, but these creatures are magnificent and they were well looked after and bred really well.
Obviously the psychiatric establishment (who you are forced by law to enter your home regularly) disapproved. When a whole industry is based so heavily on the inhumane torture of rodents it is no wonder that well-looked after hamster pets are an anathema. I disagree with scientific testing on animals wholeheartedly.
Pretty soon, I got a new diagnosis added to me medical sheets. Tyson brandished me with ‘hamster disorder’. Obviously I felt she was deranged and couldn’t understand how this new illness to me fitted into the DSM. I made some enquiries next time I was among sane people. I casually mentioned to a female music industry friend and associate next time I was at one of my artist’s studios in Cardiff. I often tell people about some of the nonsense I put up with in this mental health system. It helps to have normal people’s advice. Kath explained to me that ‘hamster disorder’ was in actual fact a real medical condition ans warned me that I shouldn’t perhaps be quite too blasé about this new condition and that I certainly shouldn’t be so casual in revealing it to people, especially strangers.
I was a little concerned at Kath’s tone of voice as I realised that she was being serious. She got out the laptop and quickly googled a page for me too show exactly why she was concerned. Most of my friends knew how much our hamsters meant to me and I really wish I hadn’t investigated my new diagnosis. It turns out that hamster disorder actually refers to a sexual fetish whereby ‘people’ get pleasure by inserting live hamsters up their rectal passages. Obviously, I hit the roof just to know the cheek of this woman doctor, Agi Tyson, to have actually accused me of bestiality with my family pets. Things went even further downhill from then on. I was soon kidnapped and taken away to the mental hospital. Tyson tended to use Talygarn Ward at Griffithstown County Hospital in Pontypool. While she injected me with medicines to which I have an allergy over a period of months, the council-employed rat-catchers were sent out to my home to lay down traps everywhere and exterminate my family pets.
Just to set the record straight, I do not suffer from hamster disorder and I do not indulge in bestiality of any kind. I do resent the diagnosis from Tyson and I do resent the false accusations. I resent the police involvement in enforcing the mental health act and I resent to be treated for this ‘illness’. I do agree it is a sick condition and I don’t care if Hollywood stars have been afflicted with it. My hamsters were well-looked after and Nicola and I loved having them be part of our lives for several enjoyable years. Psychiatry is sick and it is that which needs to be eradicated, not animals.
When I found out just prior to Christmas 2014, about my former psychiatrist Dr Darryl Watts’ criminal convictions (see category http://endofterror.org/?cat=191 for more details) , I was upset, to say the least. I decided to follow the appropriate channels and sent a complaint to the Chief Executive of the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board Trust, the local NHS for this area of SE Wales. They are ultimately the employer of Dr Watts and were responsible for him being assigned to my care in the first place. Judith Paget is the current Chief Executive and having attended a private meeting with her in the past to address mental health issues, I do know her personally. I addressed the complaint to Judith, as I discovered (here: http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/866/opendoc/169907 ) that she was part of the small committee that actually gave Watts the job in the first place. From the newspaper articles surrounding his conviction I know that he is forced to disclose the full details of his criminal history to any future employer. Therefore the Aneurin Bevan UHB had full knowledge of the character of the man that they were employing.
Here is the relevant text from the above cited NHS WALES document (pp13-14) surrounding the appointment of Dr Watts.
I heard nothing for quite some time from the Trust and then received the below letter that I was told was a final resolution to my complaint about all the misdemeanours I suffered under the ‘care’ of Dr Watts over a two year period.
“I am writing further to your email to the Putting Things Right Team on 22 December 2014 regarding issues you have raised in relation to the background of a clinician providing care for you within the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board. Firstly, can I please sincerely apologise for any distress you may have experienced in relation to this matter.
On receiving your e-mail, I asked colleagues in the Mental Health and Learning Disabilities Division to contact you before Christmas to discuss this matter with you and I am aware that you have been receiving ongoing support from our team over the last couple of weeks. I hope this support has been helpful.
Specifically in relation to the concerns that you raised, I should like to inform you that when the Doctor in question was appointed to the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, the appointment panel was aware of the individual’s past history and due process was followed including confirmation that the Legal and GMC restrictions had been served and that there had been no fresh issues since the original offence that would cause concern to prevent the clinician’s right to practice
In conclusion, I would like to thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention. I understand that you have already received a copy of our information leaflet which explains how you may take matters further, through the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales, should you remain dissatisfied with this response.”
My first impression of the letter was disgust. I was annoyed that Paget herself could not regard the matter sufficiently horrific to attend to the complaint. I felt the sarcasm of the fact that they admitted sending out mental health services and subsequently police to harass and detain me, over the festive period where I wanted to enjoy myself at home, while on a study break from my university courses. The last place I wished to be was under treatment from the very organisation about which I was complaining. I do not have faith in the mental health services of Aneurin Bevan UHB and do not feel safe in their environment. AT ALL.
They seemed completely nonchalant about Watts’ appointment and seemed to defend him to the hilt. He had a right to practise his medicine and who are they to deny that? I just wonder how many others have been affected by an irresponsible appointment? Now that the man is allowed back working with children in the area, as a psychiatrist, I find this sickening. When you hear about the convicted Welsh footballer, Ched Evans, facing such public outcry over his return to football it does make you question some of Aneurin Bevan UHB’s decisions here. A convicted doctor has a right to work and ‘sod the public’ – they have no need to know. It’s just ridiculous and smacks of institutionalised paedophilia that you here so much about in the media. I am unsatisfied with the response and have informed the trust of this and have taken the matter to the Public Ombudsman for Wales where I hope they will see some sense in my grievances.
I am annoyed that it seems that my whole meeting with Mrs Paget and some colleagues about a year ago, is now a complete waste of time. In our hour session we discussed from a patient’s perspective how the mental health services could be improved. In particular I talked of how Occupational Therapy could receive more funding and one of Judith’s colleagues suggested how they wanted to employ me in a education role, to help train their staff about how a mental patient actually perceives the services. After the meeting I left feeling like my voice had been heard but there was zero follow up and nothing ever transpired.
Quite frankly, having worked in an educational role: teaching music (DJing) for the government, Arts Council Wales, Newport Arts Council, Monmouthshire Youth Services, DOE Award Scheme, Newport Arts Disability, Nash Pilot Project, NASH homeless hostels, Young Offenders Orgs and various others – I cannot possibly accept a position as a teacher for an establishment that actually employs convicted child sex offenders. It is just ridiculous attempting to educate in a system where the very head is knowingly appointing such vile members of society to work at taxpayer wages of some ridiculous 6 figure per annum sum… How I am expected to maintain any sort of faith in this Health Trust from now on, God only knows, but I do know that they won’t be going away.
Yes, it may be victory for you, Dr Darryl Watts et al, but I’ll be the one sleeping tonight, with a clear conscience. Have a look in the mirror at your own mental health issues, all involved.
All I can say is that Aneurin Bevan, for all the good he brought to Britain, in founding the NHS, must be turning in his grave to see his name attached to such a vile organisation as the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board Trust.
Not wanting to sound the horn or anything, but: PEOPLE, THERE IS A GENERAL ELECTION COMING UP! Come May unless you adhere to Russell Brand’s non-voting strategy, then you could well be heading to the polling booth. We heard of ‘weaponising the NHS in the buildup and it looks like a weird old forthcoming election with the rise of UKIP and some pretty unsettling times here in the UK and indeed in the wider world.
I put a picture of Farage on this post as I have heard time and time again people citing immigration as a key issue. I am very pro-European in essence. As a Translation student and a man with a passion for foreign languages, I embrace the ‘otherness’ of cultures from abroad. I think that in expelling immigrants and abandoning the European we would instantly be cats back into the stone age. Immigration brings us a net benefit in terms of capital, cultural diversity and skills in the workplace, plus it would be rather difficult to study foreign languages in the education sector if all foreigners are thrown out à la Farage.
But, politics aside, immigration is a real issue. We hear of how our NHS is full of nurses and doctors from abroad. In fact, I believe that I am correct in saying that proportionally, the NHS employs more foreign workers than the average organisation.
I think that in healthcare, some of my pro-immigration views do distort. I can especially remember when my dying grandmother was in hospital. She came from a pre 1960s immigration boom generation. She was supporting an RAF pilot during WW2 and part of the incredible effort made by home soil women during that conflict. Her values and ideas were very old-fashioned and quite a bit different from my own. I felt a bit ashamed when she was openly cursing foreign NHS workers during her treatment. I found it a little rude, but, who am I to judge? I come from a more tolerant generation whose values have been shaped by a different set of problems and I live in a more or less totally globalised world. I wonder though, how the older, often politically silent generation feel about their healthcare needs being attended to by foreigners.
We are constantly told how our education and especially higher education system is among the best in the world. If that is the case, why can not one of our biggest national establishments, the NHS, fill its parole with home-born, home-educated, British doctors and nurses? Are we lacking in the educational field for medicine? Are salaries in the NHS really that dire? We recruit from abroad in our healthcare sectors. Doctors and Nurses who have trained up and learnt their craft in a different educational environment, in nations where we do not control the political systems and where life values are very much different.
I would argue that surgery is surgery and a surgeon, who is treating the body, usually of an unconscious patient, is either skilled and capable or not, wherever he has been taught medicine. He is not necessarily having to speak to a patient. He has no real need to understand them, and he has no real political power in terms of affecting that patient’s life, bar saving it from a scientific bodily perspective.
At the other end of the top pay-scale NHS bracket, however, is consultant psychiatrists. They have no surgical function. They allegedly ‘treat’ mental issues, which are societal in nature and where the medical science is extremely lacking. My argument against psychiatrists, is that they have much more scope for errors in judgement. A psychiatrist who makes poor decisions can cover up their mistakes with political obfuscation. Their failures are buried in the system. They take people’s liberty, have the facility to treat against consent and their process takes on average a much longer period. They have more long term impact on a patient’s life and can be severely disruptive even if they happen to be benefitting the patient. A surgeon who makes an error on the operating table has little recourse for excuse-making as the patient will usually directly have a major emergency issue or the health problem (where science is a lot more accurate) will not dissipate.
When you take into account the societal factors affecting mental illness and introduce immigrant psychiatrists to the equation we have a whole host of medical ethics issues. I can understand the internationalisation of academia, especially in today’s world. A medical degree in Prague, could carry equal weight as one from Delhi or London. Faculties exchange ideas, information and share resources. However, how can the value system of a a foreigner, born and brought up in a different land, be shaped as to fit the needs of patients in the host country?
Over the 18 years I’ve been in the UK mental health system, I can actually count the number of UK born, UK raised, UK qualified psychiatrists who have treated me on one hand. There has been a rainbow of different nationalities involved in the senior position of psychiatrist in my healthcare, which on the whole has been very suppressive and done entirely against my consent, involving large quantities of restricted liberty. I’ve had consultant psychiatrists from Sri Lanka (Dr Nirmalie Mirando), Poland (Dr Agnieszca Tyson) and my current one is from Iraq (Dr Nahla Jamil). Other psychiatrists who have treated me hail from Sudan (Dr. Ali, Dr. Ahmed), India / Pakistan (unknown – several), Egypt (Dr Nimkar) other African doctors. There is a multitude of senior professionals who have had a lot of power invested in them by the British system. I question the ability of these doctors to be subjective and to truly understand British values and the psychiatry of people who are nurtured in this country. Most of them only arrived on these shores post- qualification, as young adults. They know little about core UK cultural values and textbooks I’m afraid are no substitute for living the real British life. I find these foreigners to be often lacking in critical understanding of what it is to be British. Often their medical knowledge of their subject field is vastly superior to the British psychiatrists that I have encountered. However, these doctors can be quite irrational and lack understanding. If you had been educated and brought up in a civil war environment, or behind the depths of the Iron Curtain, or in a land where Jihadism is rife and governments are notable for their lack of organisation, how can you hope to understand the complex nature of the United Kingdom and its remnants of Empire? Perhaps it is these very remnants which leads these doctors here to practise in the first place?
I object to almost omnipotent unchecked power being awarded to foreign nationals, whatever their qualifications, as it leads to controversial issues which the almost childlike, trusting, naive nature of UK authorities cannot bring to heel. If these foreigners ever had malicious intent it would be far too easy for them to disrupt future generations of Britain through the suppressive nature of irresponsible legislation such as the Mental Health Act.
In the USA, they have a sensible law that states that the US President has to be a US born US citizen. Does this make the USA a racist, undemocratic country?
For or against foreigners in the NHS? I see the mental health branch of the NHS being an overall disgrace and believe that foreigners elevated to positions of power within it is a dangerous policy for senior NHS recruitment managers.
I don’t believe in force and enjoy the ideology of democracy so I won’t force my ideas down your throat. It’s just an experience-based opinion and despite being on the whole pro-immigration, I feel that there should be rational balances and checks in place to protect the native-born nationals of these Isles.

‘Without a doubt, princes become great when they overcome difficulties and obstacles that are imposed upon them; and therefore fortune, especially when she wishes to increase the reputation of a new prince, who has a greater need to acquire prestige than a hereditary prince does, creates enemies for him and has them take action against him so that he will have the chance to overcome them and to climb higher up the ladder his enemies have brought him. Therefore many judge that a wise prince must, whenever he has the occasion, foster with cunning some hostility so that in stamping it out his greatness will increase as a result.’ Niccolò Machiavelli (in The Prince)
Politics according to Machiavelli is an evil and ruthless game of cunning and to be honest is something which I do not relish. I find it boring and full of wicked people. Every so often in life, however, we are dealt a strange twist of fate and end up staring straight down the barrel at the perils of the political system created by our masters. I write this article as a moment of inspiration, though with a touch of antecedent clairvoyance and inevitability. The time is now and while the IRON LADY still lives on and is yet to draw her last breath I thought I’d pencil some thoughts into print.
Margaret Thatcher is a name one associates with British politics at the very least. A striking figure who cut the world stage at an exciting time of history, of that there is no doubt, but here are some of my words that I wish to get published to my blog all ready to be posted at the time of her death as the world readies itself for public outpourings of grief, mingled with images of torn bodies of victims of the Falklands conflict and the strikes of brutalised South Wales miners.
I grew up in South Wales though was too young to appreciate what was happening during the miners’ strike. However, my earliest memories of politics came to me at playgroup when a woman announced that free milk was being stopped for all children and that when we went onto infants school we would no longer qualify for a nice cold jar of white midmorning. The Korovo Milkbar’s playground rang to the tune of ‘Thatcher Thatcher, Milk Snatcher!’ as we, bereft of our beloved Moloko Vellocet, marched out to the tunes that the older kids had drilled into us. The lady on the news had made her feelings known and though I understood not why, politics had reared its ugly head for the first time in my life.
Free milk or not, my feelings for Thatcher have arisen through my latter years of contact with the system’s antics. In my short thirty-two years of life I have unpleasantly witnessed on about 8 separate occasions, government employees issuing me with rights leaflets about detention under the mental health act. Clearly printed on every leaflet is that the act issues from 1983, passed during Thatcher’s time as prime minister. The act gives far-reaching powers to the government to lock people up, in contrary to their rights under the Magna Carta or indeed UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in psychiatric institutions. Surely mental hospitals are necessary and a place where sick people go to be cured? I tell you for a fact that mental hospitals are not full of dangermongers waiting to cut you up on the streets or boil your children alive. Psychiatry is a modern evil, a subject with no antiquity in its distant past, no foundation for Freud’s nonsense in a classical education. Psychiatry is a system of torture founded on the principles of chemically altering the brains of laboratory animals and passing on the control methods to those that rule the masses. As a science it cannot claim to exist as there is no scientific proof of any of the illnesses psychiatry diagnoses and treats, let alone cures. It is plain and simple torture and masquerades in the public eye as a humane necessity, disguising the real fact that it is a tool of oppression.
Thatcher passed the Mental Health Act law as it stands during her time as head of government and for that I thank her not. Subsequent governments have amended the act and in particular, if you question the political polarity of this read, a certain Tony Blair, who introduced the far-reaching powers of CTO or Community Treatment Orders under which I currently reside.
What I wish for is that my human rights are respected and that the Mental Health Act should be abolished. This will never happen as we live in dark times. Perhaps I should let my vengeful side reside a little and hope that during Baroness Margaret’s lifetime she should experience a little taste of her own medicine. Maybe 15 baton-wielding, handcuff-toting plastic-clad coppers could break into her bed lairs and pounce on her unawares. She could be presented with the last clear picture a disciplined mind gets to see; a rights form of the Mental Health Act. 3 pages of printed nonsense detailing how you can appeal against the butchery that is about to occur. A foreign immigrant doctor gives the signal and under the auspices of an army of malicious social workers, your local friendly GP and with the dutiful aid of a torture-trained team of nurse thugs she could be pinned down and viciously stabbed repeatedly in her arse with heavy duty tranqulisers and left to rot in the cells for a prolonged period, force-fed on the faeces of NHS canteens, experiencing at every waking moment the dulcet drone of psychiatric patient indoctrination. The system works and perhaps justice would be served if the freedom that politicians are supposed to protect came to be suspended from them. The public do not know what this murky blanket covers and have a right to be told. Margaret Thatcher to me is a tyrant, and has snatched my freedom.
What political system could save me, what could be different? The masses blindly follow their leaders and rarely question in detail how they act. History writes its own tale. We look back at the brutality of certain regimes such as that of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia where millions starved to death and mountains of skulls dotted the highways under the auspices of Pol Pot’s army of black-clad child soldiers. He was only investing his methods into the minds of the youth. He empowered them and probably never suspended their free school milk. Yet he will be marked out as an evil man. How will Thatcher be remembered? No doubt statues will go up but I bet there won’t be many in South Wales. I speak from the heart and I am sure that there won’t be a mass exodus of coaches from my local area to attend her funeral. I’d like to be there, of course, just so I could get a glimpse of her arse and see if the friendly Mr Piggys left any battle scars on her, prior to the onslaught she suffered after fifty rounds of needles in her bum.
Many of you reading this will know me and may join in the banter of calling me a lunatic and many of you will believe that I am a sick person in some way. It is only natural to do so, but examine the facts yourself and ask yourselves what you have laid witness to yourselves in my presence. Am I a danger? Is the government’s torture of me justified? Does it help make society a better place?
I end this rant and leave you in peace, but I implore you to never accept the loss of your freedom or personal dignity. Greatness will follow you, of the questioning mind, every way your interrogating hearts allow you in your drives for thirsty success in life. Remember ye, the good people you meet on your travels, and do kindness and be generous to all those that surround you. You will lead a healthy life and be prosperous. Freedom exists.

Just going back to my regular meeting with the Stasi earlier this week… (Stasi were originally the East German Secret Police) I refer to my crack psychiatric home treatment team endearingly as the Stasi as it sums up neatly what they are really like.
I was discussing with David, the new Irish male CPN (Community Psychiatric Nurse) a load of reasons why they were all evil for not leaving me in peace alone, away from the horrendously haunting psychiatric system. He said that I was babbling speculative philosophy – that it was all mental illness. I then asked him to expand why it was philosophy. I said that I was speaking the truth and reality but it was philosophy to him as he’d been brainwashed and divorced from humanity through his psychiatric education and training. I was asked repeatedly to show more ‘Courtesy’. I said that there were no laws saying I had to be courteous, especially to people I do not choose to be in my life. He said that he would get the psychiatrist to implement that I had to be courteous as part of the legal conditions for my C.T.O. (Community Treatment Order). I said that this wasn’t legal and that the psychiatrist had no legal powers to do such a thing. He then spoke about the fact the psychiatrist (Dr. Ballantyne-Watts [Wales Forensic Psychiatry]) actually did have these powers. He expanded by saying that psychiatrists are very powerful (of that I am positively certain) and that some people believe that they are modern day Gods. I thought it was just a witty retort from him at first and giggled a little but the CPNs face remained stern and unchanged. I realised he was serious. I said that I would never be worshipping a human as a God and certainly not a psychiatrist and certainly not Dr. Ballantyne-Watts. He looked puzzled and didn’t seem to comprehend. I guess when you are so conditionned to working in the system, to blindly follow any order from above, that seeing the boss as a living embodiment of God is not strange. He then implied that psychiatrists had superhuman intelligence and were divine. I didn’t really wish to blaspheme against the poor fella’s beliefs. At the end of the day, I believe in freedom of choice, in particular the right to choose one’s religion (as enshrined in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights). I had to just leave the topic and accept that our views differed.
I have noticed, however, over the years, how positively psychiatrists and the mental health system rejects religion. They sneer at it. When I first entered hospital in 1997 I noticed a lot of patients reading the bible and talking about stories from the Bible. this seemed a little strange to me. It was the modern world and our society is quite secular. I hadn’t been brought up particularly religiously, yet had attended school chapel and assemblies every day and had a faint understanding of the Bible. I believed in God, but not rigorously. I was 19 – often people find religion or ‘God’ later in life than at this freshfaced tender age. It seemed bizarre but what seemed more alarming and strange was the way in which the Mental Health nurses enforcedly rejected religion. Bibles were confiscated from patients. Anyone mentionning a religous topic openly was condemned immediately, either sent off for punishment in the secure ward, medicated more (eg. injection), or just harshly verbally reprimanded and mocked. Perhaps there was something to this religion malarky?
Over the years, as I spent more and more time on lockdown I decided to put the time to as good a use as possible by studying and reading. I wanted a career as a musician but music is so oppressed inside a mental hospital it isn’t funny. Radios are confiscated and banned . When i first entered the Mental Health System, patients used to gather in the smoking room around the radio all day. On a Saturday Night there was quite a party atmosphere. I can remember grooving around to the Radio 1 Essential Selection or Lovegroove Dance Party. If you closed your eyes you could imagine yourself in the Ministry of Sound, or wherever you so desired or should have been spending the weekend.
In about 2000 when I was sectionned for a total of ten and a half months, my first experience of total institutionalisation. I managed to smuggle my old school King James Bible in. I secretly read it at night and went straight through, cover to cover. It was a really good read and I’d recommend for anyone to do the same regardless of your religious beliefs. It was also during this period of incarceration that I began going to church. It wasn’t really to fulfill a higher purpose; I just noticed that, by attending church on Sunday in Caerleon’s local church, it gave a good excuse to actually get out of the nuthouse for a while. You could claim that you wished to exercise your right to worship the state religion, and although it took weeks of playing this card before they finally acquiesced, it came to the point where they knew that they might get into trouble for continuing to prevent you from exercising this right. Initially the excuse for not allowing it was that there was a hospital chapel which arranged a Sunday service but it just so happened that at that time nobody could be bothered to actually allow this service to proceed, so in the end they had to let a few others with the same idea, and me, pop into the town for an hour or two. One thing I’ll say about the Caerleon congregation is that they are all very welcoming and the church at that time was generally well-attended. When I saw Arthur, the vicar, stood in his pulpit, remembering those less fortunate in the community, those stuck inside the Mental Hospital, it genuinely touched my heart. I came to know Arthur personally as he made regular trips into the hospital and for patients with few visitors he was absolutely critical to their wellbeing. An outsider might imagine that you have all the care you need inside a nuthouse, with all the healthcare professional being paid to look after you in there. The reality of that situation is quite different. Arthur would sit and chat to everyone, whether they wished to talk about God or anything else they were bothered about. You get treated like cattle awaiting slaughter inside a nuthouse. Another myth of treatment is that you will spend hours talking over all your mental health issues with the psychiatrist. This is the biggest lie of the lot. You see the shrink once a week, usually a Monday morning – It’s the only time they actually are in the hospital physically. And you see them for ten minutes, no more. Never is anything substantial discussed, bar medication. The treatment system is totally dependent on drugs. The rest of the time the shrinks are analysing drugs company marketing material, to see which company is offering the best incentives. Usually cash incentives. I have picked this knowledge up from reading psychiatry books – and just noticing all the drug company bumph lying around in offices – you can see what’s coming next in your treatment regime when the staff start drinking from fresh drug company branded coffee mugs, as it means the drug rep has been and left a few parting gifts after striking a big deal.. There is such a fierce war between drugs companies for the increasingly lucrative market share that the advertising campaigns are like US Presidential races in terms of budget and ferocity of advertising.
Arthur was about the only person to turn to for salvation and, to be fair, is a good man, as he serves his community in the correct manner. When I was in the Beechwood PICU in St. Cadoc’s secure Unit where you have literally nothing, no possessions – nothing, for about 4 months straight, Arthur noticed I’d disappeared and sought me out, bringing a Bible which was like a Godsend, literally. Of course it soon gets confiscated once he’s out the door, but the thought is well intended. I also had my first and only communion inside the locked ward. The staff even told my visitors who turned up that I wasn’t there – I’d been transferred somewhere else and they didn’t know how to find me. They do get perverse kicks when enhancing your suffering. Arthur still managed to get through those barriers and I will forever be grateful.
As a side note, one day on Augustus Ward, an acute Unit in St. Cadoc’s, this posh-looking, well-spoken holy man came in. I sat and had a good quarter an hour chat. He was the Bishop of the See of Monmouthshire, a certain Rowan Williams, who of course is the current Archbishop of Canterbury. It’s funny watching him in Westminster Abbey on the tele with the Queen when you know you’ve had a tepid St. Cad’s coffee with him – of course nowadays they’d probably class this as a delusion but it is true. Ask Rowan Williams if you bump into him if he’s ever been to St. Cadoc’s with Wez G and he’ll tell you the truth… The Priory may get all the spotlight as the place to be but we’ve had a few stars down our way too…
I sound a bit like a preacher here but although I believe in God, after reading the Bible, I read a load of other major religious texts and philosophy and much more. I don’t believe that any one world religion has their definition of God correct – I think that a fusion of beliefs is possible and that religion has been alarmingly misused over the years. My facebook-declared religious views are ‘Ayahuasca Shaman’ but that’s a story for another day.One thing I can say is that most religions carry the same fundamental message. It’s easy to hear people say ‘religion = load of nonsense – cause of all wars -and totally dismiss it, but we must remember that most of modern society has developed as a result of these belief systems. Our ancestors chose to (and indeed chose not to and were sometimes forced to) live their lives by the laws laid down in these books. Even a sceptic has to recognise that there is a great deal of knowledge of good and evil contained in holy texts or beliefs or traditions. It is part of history and culture. The point I aspire to is that it would not harm these Mental Health workers to actually accept some of the ideas and wisdom of these religions. There is a tendency nowadays to reject the old in favour of the new and we have come to accept that change is always for the better. This isn’t strictly true, as too much change will upset the overall balance of any system. Being radical for the sake of being radical leaves you clutching at straws as if you abolish everything as you have no canvas left on which to paint a new picture. The religious beliefs have been around in most cases for thousands of years. Psychiatry is a much more recent cult or fad, which has never properly defined itself. It is a lost pseudoscience (or other categeory) with really wishy-washy vague ideas and definitions.
When I hear daftness coming from people appointed by the UK government to march into my home, threaten me with the law and try and get me to worship another human being, who quite frankly cannot possibly be God…It irritates me to the core and I cannot understand what accepting to do this will achieve. Perhaps why they say I’m mad. If I do bow down before the Doctor, will they finally leave me alone? It’s gone too far for them to withdraw by now and once I’m bowing, I’ll soon be forced to kneel and pretty soon I’ll be prostrating myself and self-whipping my back to punish myself for not being chaste enough in God’s sight. The guy’s only in his Mid-Fifties and even despite the argument between Creationists and Evolutionists, even they would, I hope, unanimously agree that whoever created the world must have done so more than 60 years ago. If there’s evidence to suggest otherwise then I stand corrected.
As I counter-psychoanalyse my interrogators, I observe that they are always so cagey at giving information up, it is hard to pinpoint their actual goals and agenda. God-king cults have sprung up in history – Are the psychiatrists a priesthood? It worries me as people will think that this is all bonkers, I’m lying, nuts whatever, but if you are all worshipping psychiatrists in a decade or so you can look back and say you heard it here first. Silly things do emerge in society from time to time and unless you see them coming it is often difficult ever understanding how they arrived. Take X-Factor or Pop Idol for example? How on earth did they crop up? I, for one, didn’t foresee the music industry being so affected by these TV talent shows. I will always totally reject the worship of psychiatrists, until the torture gets too intense perhaps, but even then I think that I shall resist. Perhaps when my brain finally is in the pickle jar on their desk I might be tempted to pay homage, but even then I’ll still be pulling faces. Psychiatry as a religion disgusts me. Yes – you may think – oh – this cannot possibly be true or ever eventualise but I don’t think that the public in general understand just exactly how powerful the Mental Health movement is. It has all the traits of religion – vast amounts of money, people in powerful positions across society all profit from it, they have the unquestionable loyalty of the weaponised authorities (ie. Police) who are prepared to use force to protect the regime, they have the desire for more control over those they see as weaker and will cease at no issue of morality in order to achieve their ends. When you couple in the sheepish nature of the masses to follow whither they are ordered without questionning the command, the scene is set. I don’t know just how far the Mental Health Act powers will take what is being done in the name of the law. I don’t wish to discover either. Like a cornered animal you have to stand and fight and it would be nice to maintain civilized protocol that dates back before the time of Marx and has been the preserve of peaceful people across eternity. Examine history – look at how such horrific movements spring up from time to time. Psychiatry is weaving its clutches virtually everywhere in a world that has been globalised more than ever before. The entire future of our species is at stake.
Psychiatrists. mental health workers, police, social workers, all involved, your God is a false God. I will not worship my psychiatrist.

Today, I have a card that I made for the Bitten By the Bug Challenge. This week we were supposed to make something with a stocking cut from a Cricut any cartridge. Since I love the Close To My Heart Artfully Sent cartridge so much and it has a great stockings cut on it, this card was meant to be!
For this card, I did some fancy heat embossing. It really adds that touch a class and elegance to Christmas cards. Don't let embossing scare you. Like anything else, practice does make perfect!

OMG Miss Melanie What a Fun and Beautiful Card!! I love your stockings they are so cute and your embossing is just gorgeous!! The gold ribbon was the perfect sweet touch. Girl you sure did one outstanding creative job!!
Beautiful and classy card,just like you Melanie!! I should of known you'd find a way to make your own paper with the gold embossing. Your right about the practice, I'm still trying to master the art of embossing to the level you've achieved. Thanks for sharing.
I am a fan of embossing also. I so appreciate the link for the Explore. Yes...everyone should have one as it has totally changed my crafting.
This is such a pretty card with the embossing. The embossing is so elegant. I love the stockings and the beautiful bow.
Those little stockings are so sweet. I like the richness of the cold with the pretty red and green paper you have used for them.
Heat embossing is such a fun technique to use. I love watching people's faces when I show them how to do it. It's a hoot when they rub their fingers over the embossed image to feel it and want to try it again and again. When I first started I had no heat gun and made do with a bare light bulb. It's a wonder I am not blind! lol

The Church celebrates 165 years of ministry in Rockford in 2017, making it one of the oldest religious institutions in Northern Illinois.
Our Church building is rich with history, having survived a severe windstorm in 1905 and being burnt to the ground by an arsonist in 1969. Each time, we’ve survived with a firmer commitment to serve God and the Rockford community.
In 1851, twenty Methodists on Rockford's west side met on Sunday afternoons and Thursday evenings for prayer meetings in the home of James B. Skinner, a house which then stood on the southeast corner of Main and Mulberry Streets.
Meanwhile on Rockford’s east side, Sunday worship services were held at First Methodist Episcopal Church (now Centennial United Methodist Church). As the congregation quickly grew, its pastor suggested the formation of a west side church. His challenge accepted, Winnebago County records indicate that the Second Methodist Episcopal Church was officially organized in January 1852 with the following men listed as trustees: William J. Cole, James Taylor, Dr. Charles N. Andrews, Jonathan Hitchcock and James B. Skinner.
In January 1853, a lot located on the west side of Court Street near State Street was purchased, and the construction of the Second Methodist Episcopal Church began under architect John Austin’s supervision. During the construction period, worship services were held in Boyd's Hall, a room on the third floor of a stone building in the one hundred block of West State Street.
The new church building was dedicated in November 1854. An impressive brick structure trimmed in white, it was surrounded by a spacious lawn and a wrought iron fence. The total cost of the building and grounds was $7,000.
After several decades of progress and growth, it became apparent that a larger building was necessary to accommodate the growing church membership. In September 1883, the present site on the corner of Court and Mulberry Streets was purchased and a building committee selected to prepare plans for the new sanctuary. The committee chose a church member, David Keyt, to be the architect. Ground breaking ceremonies were held one year later in September 1884. During the winter of 1886-1887, the congregation held worship services in the basement of the new building. In May 1887, the Court Street Methodist Episcopal Church was dedicated with a construction cost of nearly $80,000.
Few changes were made to the building over the next twenty-five years. In 1905, a severe windstorm destroyed the original steeple of the church and the following year a new bell tower was erected.
Its growth and community influence increasing, Court Street Church recognized the need of a building that met the educational and social needs of the congregation. Consequently in 1911, lots adjoining the north of the church were purchased at a cost of $10,000. Construction of the new unit began in 1915, with a dedication on April 1917.
Since its construction in 1887, no major changes altered the Court Street Church sanctuary. In November 1929, member architect A. Reyner Eastman designed a new chancel of even more reverence and beauty.
The bell tower was remodeled in 1941 to its present appearance with no other changes then made until 1961.
During autumn of 1961, the church held a crusader from asking for pledges to fulfill the first phase of a one-million-dollar expansion program.
The church purchased the lot north of the institutional wing, demolished the home on it, began constructing a new chapel and institutional building on June, 1962, and construction was completed in 1963. The chapel with its handsome cherry paneling and beautiful symbolic windows endowed the congregation with still another inspiring place in which to worship. The addition contained more educational rooms and various facilities for the music department.
The second phase of the ambitious expansion of the church was the remodeling of the old institutional building that had been in use since 1917. By the fall of 1968, contractors gutted the old structure and rebuilt it to house the renovated classrooms, the dining room and kitchen, and the ladies' parlor. In addition, the church offices had been moved from their former location at the southeast corner of the church building to this remodeled section.
Only five months after this phase of the expansion project was completed, disaster struck. On March 18, 1969 during the noon hour, an arsonist set a fire behind the east side choir stalls. Within hours, the sanctuary was destroyed, its charred ruins representing a $2,250,000 loss to its members. No price can ever be placed on the feeling of devastation that the ministers and congregation experienced on that day.
The congregation pulled together and resolved to rebuild the sanctuary as it had been and reconstruction plans began. During this time, Sunday services were held at 8:30 in the chapel and at 10:45 in the Coronado Theater. Less than two years after the disastrous fire, the first service was held in the new sanctuary on Christmas Eve 1970. Lovelier than ever, it appeared almost as before; the subtle changes contributed not only to its beauty but to its functionality as well.
If vision, courage, ability and dedication were required in the early development of what is now Court Street United Methodist Church, it is obvious that the same traits were needed and prevalent during its dynamic history. We have been abundantly blessed, and still are, with ministers and members displaying these admirable attributes.

The recent article in the Washington Post by Sarah Kaplan (Dread is vanishing for the animal world. Here’s why that’s a bad thing, Morning Mix, February 24) highlighted a recently published scientific article demonstrating how fear of large predators can establish a “landscape of fear” in their prey, in this case a smaller, meso-predator, the raccoon. Because prey will be reluctant to go to areas where there is a high risk that they will be killed, fear can have profound effects on their behavior and spatial use of the landscape. The avoidance of high risk areas then cascades through to all levels of the ecosystem.
As the originator of the ecological concept of the landscape of fear (http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/z01-094), it is obviously satisfying to see experimental support of the model I proposed. However, beyond personal satisfaction, I find the results of this work to have tremendous implications to the whole Eastern forest ecosystem.
As the authors concluded and Ms Kaplan aptly pointed out, the lack of a landscape fear can have immense and ecologically harmful impacts across a whole ecosystem. And that is what is happening across the entire eastern forest. When white-tailed deer returned to the East in the late 20th century, they have returned to a landscape lacking the original large predators, wolves and cougars… a landscape lacking fear. As a consequence, deer have not only increased to excessive numbers but are free to roam around the landscape eating whatever they want, wherever they want, and whenever they want.
The ecological results of this uncontrolled herbivory by deer are being documented all across the East. Foresters complain deer are hindering reforestation by “vacuuming up” tree seedlings they plant. All across existing forests, the lack of survival of native tree seedling is halting the regeneration of these forests as old trees die.
On the forest floor, the diversity of native flowering plants is decreasing, being replaced by invasive species unpalatable to deer. In particular, the ginseng industry is suffering as deer eat the emerging plants before humans can harvest them. Although not as well documented, the removal of ground cover plant species by deer is affecting the survival of ground nesting birds and may even be the cause of the decline in the New England cottontail rabbit.
More closer to us personally, excess numbers of deer give most of the eastern states the dubious honor of being the top states for deer-car collisions, resulting in thousands of injuries and an excess of 100 deaths per year. High rates of Lyme disease, requiring the association between ticks and deer can also likely be attributed to the uncontrolled deer numbers and movements across the landscape.
These and more demonstrate that the eastern ecosystems are declining under the sheer number and free movement of deer across a landscape lacking of fear. It is now accepted that to return a prey without its predator is an ecological blunder, a blunder that can only be rectified by the concurrent return of the predators, the return of the landscape of fear. This is why I and many others, in particular, the Cougar Rewilding Foundation (http://www.easterncougar.org/), have been calling for the reintroduction of cougars to the East.
There is abundant habitat for cougars across much of the East and contrary to popular myths, cougars are not particularly dangerous. The now famous cougar, P22 in Southern California (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMO8-f70nFY) has amply demonstrated that cougars can easily live harmoniously within heavily populated areas.
The return of cougars would likely reduce the excessive number of deer somewhat but more importantly, they would keep the remaining deer in their ecological role by fear and prevent them from the massive destruction they are currently causing. Cougars would establish a landscape of fear that would create refuges in high risk areas for favored plant species of deer, maintaining forest diversity and allowing regeneration of the forest to occur.
As cougars are most effective along forest edges in capturing their prey, deer might be more reluctant to use forest edges along highways, reducing deer-car collisions and saving lives.
These and many more safety and ecological reasons clearly justify the return of cougars to the East. They would be relatively good wildlife neighbors and provide valuable ecological benefits and services that would help restore the ecological health of eastern forests. This article reported in the Washington Post demonstrates that the science is solidly behind the need for cougars in the East. What is lacking is the social will to do the ecologically right thing, return cougars to the east where they belong.
The 12th consecutive year of studying Black Bears in northern Michigan by the Dept of Natural Resources is revealing that "“Black bears are doing very well"..............."Litter sizes seem to be a little bigger than they were 20 to 25 years ago and the fitness of the bears being trapped for study is robust...................Approximately 15,000 - 19,000 black bears (including cubs) roam the hardwood and conifer forests of northern Michigan................ About 90 percent of the bear live in the Upper Peninsula, while the remaining ten percent are mainly found in the northern Lower Peninsula...........While it is becoming increasingly common to see bear in the southern half of the Lower Peninsula, there is still no breeding population in the southern half of the state
A very special project takes DNR crews deep into the forests of Northern Michigan in search of one of the state's largest carnivores -- black bears.
The DNR looks for hibernating bears to replace tracking collars and learn more about how they are doing in Northern Michigan this season.
"This is the twelfth consecutive year that we've been out, collaring black bears," says Mark Boersen, DNR wildlife biologist.
"We have our pilot and another wildlife personnel check to get a general location and narrow it down for me so I know where to start and then we do ground-scouting, locate the den, GPS the den," Boersen says. “Permissions have to be sought from landowners when we are working on private property. We never trespass on private property. We also invite them along, too, if they choose to come along.”
"Sometimes, they just simply find a location right out in the middle of the open," says Katie Keen, DNR wildlife technician. "It's hard to believe. Other times, they can be tucked in a little bit, maybe next to a root mass or a tree."
A VHF radio helps pinpoint the den of a large mother bear and her two cubs, the goal of this morning's search.
“We have a small radio-receiver box and a hand-held antenna that we can track her collar with," Boersen says. “It works very simply by you can point it in the direction of the collar and, if you are pointing at the collar, it gets louder.”
“When we were here a year ago, she actually had newborn cubs and she had four, so when we are going to go in today, they will be yearlings, so they are a year older at this point," Keen said prior to tracking the bear. "They can be 50 to 70 pounds of fur, nails and teeth, but we’ll go in there and see how many she still has.”
"It really went almost textbook," Boersen says. "We were able to get the female sedated very quickly. [Three years ago,] we scouted her and found her actually in a ditch, covered in snow. It was far less elaborate than the den we saw today.”
They check her oxygen, her weight, her blood, make sure she's top-notch health during the entire process.
“We look over her general health, we monitor her vitals while we are working on her, make sure she’s doing well," Boersen says. "Administer a variety of drugs, antibiotics. We keep her on oxygen throughout most of the work.”
"We can see how far they move, how many cubs they have, what kind of general health they are," Boersen says. "It's all very useful in assessing the overall population health."
“We keep a small number of females collared so we can use them as surrogate mothers if the DNR should come into possession of orphaned cubs," Boersen says. "Secondly, we use the reproductive data just to keep tabs on the black bear population. And finally, we use the project as a training tool so we can train other staff who maybe aren’t as familiar in handling techniques of black bears.”
While it's not the main objective, getting crews closer to black bears like the mother bear in Roscommon County helps future bear encounters.
“The training for our staff is very important up in Northern Michigan," Keen says. "We always have wild animals that can interact with kind of an urban or human interface, so this is great on-the-job training for our staff.”
“If we have an orphaned cub in the summertime, we will have female bear in the Northern Lower with that same age young," Keen says. "We can place that orphan cub with her and she will take in new cubs.”
As for the overall look at Northern Michigan's black bear population, Boersen says things look promising.
“Black bears in Northern Michigan are doing very well," Boersen says. "In many areas, we are seeing population expansion. We are seeing litter sizes that seem to be a little bigger than they were, say, 20 to 25 years ago and we are seeing, large healthy bears when we handle these bears.”

The economic and climate-related impacts of forest destruction are well known, but continued logging could unleash devastating new pandemics and spread fatal diseases into the human population, scientists tell the Ecologist
The costs of deforestation in terms of climate change, biodiversity and economics are well known. Rainforests are also reservoirs for possible drugs, many of which have not yet been explored. But alarming new scientific research is presenting another compelling case for the urgent need to stop destruction of the world's forests.
In a series of exclusive interviews, scientists have told the Ecologist that if we don't keep remaining forests intact there is a danger that some of the planet's most life-threatening diseases could spread on a dangerous and unmanageable scale. The experts also warn that there is a serious risk of unleashing pandemics of new viruses into the world's human population.
Ravinder Sehgal, associate professor of biology at San Francisco State University, specialises in studying the effects of deforestation on African rainforest birds by mapping and modelling their diseases and blood parasites. But his research has huge potential relevance to human health.
'Non-migratory birds are a more natural system than humans, who move around a lot, so in looking at them we can determine how ecology affects the spread of disease a bit more easily,' he says. His work in Africa on species including the olive sunbird has revealed the effects of deforestation: 'We found different types of malaria in the same species of bird in deforested versus intact areas.'
The implications of this are clear, according to Sehgal: deforestation upsets the ecological balance, allowing diseases to move in unpredictable ways.
Africa has already witnessed an expansion of malaria's range. Dr Steve Lindsay, professor of public health entomology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, has nearly three decades of experience looking at vector-borne diseases throughout African and Asia.
'Deforestation raises ground temperature, increasing the rate at which mosquitoes develop into adults, frequency of blood feeding, the rate at which parasites are acquired, and the development of the parasite within mosquitoes,' he says. These increased surface temperatures due to forest clearing have allowed malaria parasites to spread their range to higher elevations, with the disease now commonly encountered in the previously malaria-free highlands of East Africa. 'For every 1 per cent of reduction in forest cover there is an 8 per cent rise in malaria mosquito population.'
With disease, however, nothing is straightforward. Lindsay acknowledges that in much of southeast Asia malaria is passed on by a forest-dwelling mosquito, so deforestation there could actually reduce cases
In the Amazon, the primary vector for malaria is a species of mosquito named Anopheles darlingi. Recorded at very low levels a few decades ago, and even absent from many areas, this mosquito has made a massive comeback in recent years, according to scientists. Jonathan Patz, professor of global environmental health at the University of Madison, Wisconsin, is a widely published member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, with a special interest in ecology, land-use change and human health. He sees this upsurge as a direct result of deforestation: 'We don't yet know the mechanism, but the partially sunlit pools in deforested areas yield more mosquito larvae.' Logging and clearance are seen as creating an ideal habitat for malaria incubation.
Things don't necessarily get better over time. Patz says that 'the mosaic effect' of secondary, regrowth forest and abandoned land can be 'even worse' for malaria than recently deforested locations. Additionally, once malaria has been allowed to arise it is difficult to contain. 'Places that historically had been logged had a much higher incidence of malaria among people,' he says. When an area has been cleared of forest it can remain contagious for a long time.
Yellow fever is another deadly disease whose complex ecology can be sent spiralling by deforestation. Usually, it is passed from monkey to monkey by mosquitoes in the high canopy. Logging can bring the monkeys closer to human habitation, and foresters into direct contact with the disease. Infected individuals from these fringe populations may then visit cities where the pathogens are picked up by the urban mosquito, Aedes aegypti, which also carries dengue fever. In this way new outbreaks can occur.
Along with deforestation, climate change and population movement, land-use change is capable of bringing diseases to new areas. In recent times the disease leishmaniasis (vectored by sandflies) has shifted its reservoir from wild animals to domestic dogs. Rice paddies in the Amazon have led to an increase in rodents, and so greater incidence of leptospirosis (Weil's disease). Professor Patz notes that large numbers of A. darlingi larvae are found in commercial fishponds. He claims that foregrounding strategies such as farming fish species that feed on mosquito larvae could be crucial methods of combating disease in these high-risk zones.
Lafcadio Cortesi, forests campaign director for Rainforest Action Network, recognises all this as a serious threat, and states that 'in terms of human productivity and quality of life, malaria is already having a huge effect'. This is an issue underexploited by environmental campaigners so far, and one that may become increasingly central. He brings in an ethical angle: 'The few elites mostly benefiting from logging activity aren't [yet] affected by the diseases they're helping to spread.'
New science of this type will be another powerful ally for those fighting for protection of the world's forests. We've heard of 'avoided deforestation', when forests are preserved on economic grounds, but what about the unreckonable savings of potentially 'avoided disease' made by keeping them intact?
Regarding these multifarious costs, Matthew Lebreton, director of the Central Africa Ecology Program for the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative (GVFI), wonders of HIV/AIDS: 'If we were doing the same work we are today in these African villages, 50, 80 or 100 years ago, what could have been done to prevent the disease or reduce its impact?' He warns: 'We are seeing new viruses in the same family as HIV crossing over into populations now.'
Headed by the dynamic scientist Nathan Wolfe, GVFI places itself 'at the interface of potentially dangerous diseases and human populations'. Monitoring diseases in places such as forest edges and regularly testing the blood of people there, while looking out for new illnesses, Matthew Lebreton and his team have a wealth of on-the-ground experience. Populations in these areas have a higher risk of contracting zoonoses (diseases that can pass from animals to humans – swine flu, avian flu and SARS being famous examples) that could then escalate. This kind of cutting-edge research is crucial for future health worldwide.
'The only way to really prevent pandemics is through education, addressing how to change behaviour and avoid risks,' Lebreton explains. Putting a name and a place to a virus – where it was discovered and in what animal or person – helps people in rural communities visualise these pathogens as real threats. 'Globally, vital to the process of prevention will be finding out new ways of making very targeted interventions related to particular species or particular behaviours to stop transmission,' he says. He cites ebola outbreaks after people have retrieved dead animals from the forest, or blood contact following hunting, as examples.
Pointing out something else easily forgotten, Lebreton says: 'Animals are just as much victims of disease as we are, and finding starting points of those viruses is extremely important. It's really significant for conservation to figure out what risks those animals have in the long term.'
Chimpanzees and (already-endangered) gorillas have suffered tremendously from ebola in Central Africa. GVFI is keen to dovetail the interests of human health with conservation. Bushmeat-hunting is already illegal in many places, and when people are aware of the risks of diseases such as ebola they are less likely to target primates.
Lebreton adds: 'There is an enormous number of viruses in wild animals already that we know very little about.' Understanding this diversity is a significant part of forest ecology, as deforestation can have complex and subtle effects. 'There are a few species, such as bats, that tend to be more susceptible to disease when their habitat it threatened or when they're put under stress. Then they are more likely to become infectious,' he says. At the same time, forest fragmentation can cause population bottlenecks, with the resulting inbreeding making animals weaker and in more danger of contracting and carrying diseases.
There is a human correlation to this, too, as Ravinder Sehgal suggests: 'People living with HIV/AIDS in these deforested areas might be more likely to get some of these new pathogens. It is tremendously complicated what's going to happen in Africa with the interactions between different diseases and deforestation. I imagine that immuno-compromised populations are breeding-grounds for new pathogens, because if a virus gets into a person with HIV/AIDS it's more likely and more able to mutate and survive in that person. So a person with HIV/AIDS is like a mixing ground, where these pathogens can potentially evolve and become more pathogenic and spread to other people.'
Sehgal also points to new research into something known as the 'dilution effect': 'Species-rich communities can potentially snuff out transmission of pathogens, such as parasites, by "wasted" transmissions to hosts who are unable to pass the parasite on to the next life stage.' This is another way in which biodiversity offers us a hidden and vital service. The enormous harmful effect of deforestation only hastens the demise of such natural systems, increasing the chance of diseases leaking out.
It might sound as though these threats are particular to the tropics, but deforestation in temperate zones can have serious consequences as well. In North America the prevalence of Lyme disease has risen following forest fragmentation. The ensuing reduction in mammal diversity has enabled the white-footed mouse – a prime carrier of the pathogen – to proliferate over new territories due to having fewer predators and competitors. Ticks feeding on the mice can pass the disease to humans. A similar situation exists in much of Asia with tick-borne encephalitis.
It's clear that the expansion and emergence of infectious diseases due to global deforestation is of pressing concern. Scientists agree on the urgency of the case and acknowledge that the issue is not" sufficiently understood.
Patz complains: 'These studies have not been well funded; the value of intact forest to protect public health is certainly underappreciated, and policymakers need to take this into account. Links between ecosystem changes and disease-spread are currently unrecognised, and this is insidious to the extent that by the time we have an epidemic we often don't look far back enough to see the causal factors, we just look at the proximal issues such as changes in mosquito-control or human population migration. In many cases it really goes back to the ecosystems and what we're doing to them – new risk factors that may cause the emergence or resurgence in diseases. Many of the irreversible changes we're doing to our landscape could lead to serious public-health threats. We must manage land-use more conscientiously and in a way that minimises the unintended consequences.'

A growing body of scientific evidence shows that the felling of tropical forests creates optimal conditions for the spread of mosquito-borne scourges, including malaria and dengue. Primates and other animals are also spreading disease from cleared forests to people.
In Borneo, an island shared by Indonesia and Malaysia, some of the world’s oldest tropical forests are being cut down and replaced with oil palm plantations at a breakneck pace. Wiping forests high in biodiversity off the land for monoculture plantations causes numerous environmental problems, from the destruction of wildlife habitat to the rapid release of stored carbon, which contributes to global warming.
But deforestation is having another worrisome effect: an increase in the spread of life-threatening diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. For a host of ecological reasons, the loss of forest can act as an incubator for insect-borne and other infectious diseases that afflict humans. The most recent example came to light this month in the Journal of Emerging Infectious Diseases, with researchers documenting a steep rise in human malaria cases in a region of Malaysian Borneo undergoing rapid deforestation.
This form of the disease was once found mainly in primates called macaques, and scientists from the London School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene wondered why there was a sudden spike in human cases. Studying satellite maps of where forest was being cut down and where it was left standing, the researchers compared the patchwork to the locations of recent malaria outbreaks. They realized the primates were concentrating in the remaining fragments of forest habitat, possibly increasing disease transmission among their own populations. Then, as humans worked on the new palm plantations, near the recently created forest edges, mosquitoes that thrived in this new habitat carried the disease from macaques to people.
Such phenomena are not uncommon. "In years when there is a lot of land clearance you get a spike in leptospirosis [a potentially fatal bacterial disease] cases, and in malaria and dengue," says Peter Daszak, the president of Ecohealth Alliance, which is part of a global effort to understand and ameliorate these dynamics. "Deforestation creates ideal habitat for some diseases."
The Borneo malaria study is the latest piece of a growing body of scientific evidence showing how cutting down large swaths of forests is a major factor in a serious human health problem — the outbreak of some of the world’s most serious infectious diseases that emerge from wildlife and insects in forests. Some 60 percent of the diseases that affect people spend part of their life cycle in wild and domestic animals.
The research work is urgent — land development is rapidly taking place across regions with high biodiversity, and the greater the number of species, the greater the number of diseases, scientists say. They are deeply concerned that the next global pandemic could come out of the forest and spread quickly around the world, as was the case with SARS and Ebola, which both emerged from wild animals.
Mosquitoes are not the only carriers of pathogens from the wild to humans. Bats, primates, and even snails can carry disease, and transmission dynamics change for all of these species following forest clearing, often creating a much greater threat to people.
Throughout human history pathogens have emerged from forests. The Zika virus, for example, which is believed to be causing microencephaly, or smaller than normal heads, in newborns in Latin America, emerged from the Zika forest of Uganda in the 1940s.
The risk of disease outbreaks can be greatly magnified after forests are cleared for agriculture and roads.
Dengue, Chikungunya, yellow fever, and some other mosquito-borne pathogens likely also came out of the forests of Africa.
Forests contain numerous pathogens that have been passed back and forth between mosquitoes and mammals for ages. Because they evolved together, these viruses often cause few or no symptoms in their hosts, providing “a protective effect from a homegrown infection,” says Richard Pollack of the T.H. Chan School Public Health at Harvard. But humans often have no such protection.
What research is demonstrating is that because of a complex chain of ecological changes, the risk of disease outbreaks, especially those carried by some mosquitoes, can be greatly magnified after forests are cleared for agriculture and roads.
A flood of sunlight pouring onto the once-shady forest floor, for example, increases water temperatures, which can aid mosquito breeding, explained Amy Vittor, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Florida. She is an expert in the ecology of deforestation and malaria, which is where this dynamic is best understood.
Deforestation creates other conditions conducive to mosquito breeding. Leaves that once made streams and ponds high in tannins disappear, which lowers the acidity and makes the water more turbid, both of which favor the breeding of some species of mosquito over others. Flowing water is dammed up, deliberately and inadvertently, and pools. Because it is no longer taken up and transpired by trees, the water table rises closer to the forest floor, which can create more swampy areas.
As agriculture replaces forest, "re-growth of low lying vegetation provides a much more suitable environment" for the mosquitoes that carry the malaria parasite, Vittor says.
The link between deforestation and increases in malaria has been known for some time, but research in the last two decades has filled in many of the details. Much of the work has been done in Peru, where in one region in the 1990s cases of malaria went from 600 per year to 120,000, just after a road was built into virgin forest and people began clearing land for farms.
The cascade of human-induced ecological changes dramatically reduces mosquito diversity. "The species that survive and become dominant, for reasons that are not well understood, almost always transmit malaria better than the species that had been most abundant in the intact forests," write Eric Chivian and Aaron Bernstein, public health experts at Harvard Medical School, in their book How Our Health Depends on Biodiversity. "This has been observed essentially everywhere malaria occurs."
Mosquitoes can adapt fairly quickly to environmental change. In response to a push to use bed nets to prevent nighttime bites in malaria-prone regions of the world, for example, researchers are seeing a change in the time of day mosquitoes bite — many now target their human quarry in the hours before bed.
A study by Vittor and others found that one malaria-carrying mosquito species, Anopheles darlingi, in a deforested area in Peru was radically different than its cousins in intact forests; the Anopheles darlingi in deforested areas bit 278 times more frequently than in an intact forest, according to a study published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 2006.
"In the forest, we found almost no breeding whatsoever, and no biting by the adult mosquitoes," Vittor said. That’s probably because the ecology of the deforested landscape — short vegetation and deep water — favored their breeding, and they need human blood to grow their eggs.
The types of mosquitoes that do well in this radically altered ecosystem are more "vector competent," which means their systems are particularly good at manufacturing a lot of the pathogen that causes malaria. A study in Brazil, published in the Journal of Emerging Infectious Diseases in 2010, found that clearing four percent of the forest resulted in a nearly 50-percent increase in human malaria cases.
The ecology of the viruses in deforested areas is different. As forests are cut down, numerous new boundaries, or edges, are created between deforested areas and forest. A mosquito called Aedes africanus, a host of the yellow fever and Chikungaya viruses, often lives in this edge habitat and bites people working or living nearby. Other primates, which are also reservoirs for the pathogens, gather in the borders of these different ecosystems, providing an ongoing source of virus for the insects.
Insects are not the only way that deforestation can exacerbate infectious diseases. For some unknown reason, the species of snails that can better adapt to warm open areas that occur after a forest is cut down are better hosts for parasites called flatworms, some of which cause schistosomiasis, a disease which damages human organs.
Scientists are concerned that these outbreaks exacerbated by human alteration of landscapes could cause the next pandemic. The Roman Empire once stretched from Scotland to Africa and lasted for more than 400 years. No one knows exactly why the empire collapsed, but one contributing factor may have been malaria. A mass grave of babies from that era, excavated in the 1990s, found, through DNA analysis, that many of them had died from malaria, according to a study published in 2001 in the journal Ancient Biomolecules. Some researchers speculate that the malaria outbreak may have been exacerbated by deforestation in Rome’s surrounding Tiber River Valley to supply timber to the growing city.
Once a disease has left a forested region, it can travel in human beings, crossing the world in a matter of hours by airplane before the person even shows symptoms. How well it does in its new homes depends on several factors.
Once Zika traveled to Brazil from Africa, for example, it flourished because Aedes aegyptimosquitoes hang out around people and love to lay their eggs in small containers of water. Many people in Brazil's large slums store water in buckets, and standing water also collects in tarps, old tires, and trash.
A key question about the Zika virus is whether it will enter the primate populations in South America, which means it might become a permanent resident and an ongoing source of infection. "Is it going to set up shop there?" asks Vittor. "We don't know."
Mosquitoes aren't the only creatures that bring fever out of the forest. Angolan free-tailed bats were believed to harbor the Ebola virus that broke out and killed more than 11,000 people last year. And AIDS, which has killed more than 25 million people worldwide, came from people eating bush meat, likely chimpanzees.
A wild card in this disease scenario is the rapidly changing climate. If spring comes early, mosquitoes hatch earlier and summer populations are larger. In Southeast Asia, the spike in temperatures during El Niño weather cycles correlates with dengue fever outbreaks, because the warmer weather allows mosquitoes to breed faster and expand the population, which spreads the virus further, according to a study last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Part of the solution is to recognize and understand these connections and teach people that keeping nature intact has protective effects. And where people do cut down forests or build roads, numerous steps can be taken to lessen the chance of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks — education campaigns, more clinics, health training, and medical monitoring.
Another piece of the puzzle is to know what pathogens the world might be up against in the future as they come out of the forest. Ecohealth Alliance is cataloging wildlife-borne viruses in wild places where there is new encroachment into undisturbed nature and health care is poor or non-existent. The goal is to better understand how these viruses might spread and to potentially develop vaccines.
"If we could deal with the trade in wildlife and deforestation we wouldn't need to stop an outbreak," like Zika or Ebola, said Daszak, the organization’s president. "We would have already dealt with it."
"Moose, Wolves and Coyotes have lived together in complex predator-prey relationships for thousands of years".............. "The ministry itself notes, “predation rates on moose by wolves tend to increase in tandem with moose numbers"............ "This naturally regulates the density of the moose population and is ultimately beneficial to moose and the ecosystems they rely on"..................So why then is the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources seeking to allow Wolves and Coyotes to be killed adjacent to Algonquin Park when so much scientific research showed it so important to ban this very hunting paradigm so as to allow the Eastern Wolf population to remain stable ?.................Politics not science at play.......Rather than acknowledge that warming temperatures and land use alteration is adversely impacting Moose populations, easier for "those in charge" to say, "LOOK, we are doing something, We kill the Wolves that eat the Moose".........."Aren't we great?"----NOT!
A government plan to weaken regulations for hunting wolves and coyotes would do little for the moose populations it’s meant to protect
By all accounts, eastern wolves (one of which is pictured here) and coyotes are difficult if not impossible to distinguish in the field.
A canine predator that travels in packs in remote areas of North America is called a wolf. Most people know this, yet by all accounts the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) seems to think it’s a goat — a scapegoat.
A plan to weaken regulations for hunting wolves and coyotes in Northern Ontario treats these predators as scapegoats, with the MNRF claiming the changes will help reduce declines in the moose population. Yet moose, wolves and coyotes have lived together in complex predator-prey relationships for thousands of years. The ministry itself notes, “Predation rates on moose by wolves tend to increase in tandem with moose numbers. This naturally regulates the density of the moose population and is ultimately beneficial to moose and the ecosystems they rely on.”
Wolves and other predators occupy an important niche in nature. Science is clear that our zest for killing such animals has resulted in significant unintended consequences and ecosystem damage. For example, removing predators can cause deer populations to increase, leading to changes in natural vegetation patterns and increased disease transmission.
A recent report by the Raincoast Conservation Foundation describes humans as “super-predators” and cautions that “although grizzlies, wolves, and cougars occasionally kill one another, it’s rare. They have not evolved as prey. More enlightened wildlife management would recognize that this reality can make carnivore hunting risky business.”
The MNRF claims the new proposal will have neutral results, yet it may well harm a species at risk, the eastern wolf. The proposed changes would apply to an area abutting Algonquin Park and adjacent townships where, to protect the eastern wolf, hunting wolves and coyotes is not permitted. By all accounts, eastern wolves and coyotes are difficult if not impossible to distinguish in the field. In effect, it would be open season on eastern wolves when they venture outside the protected zone.
Most appalling is the fact that scientists, including scientists on the ministry’s own team, agree that wolf and coyote control is not a long-term solution to address declines in prey populations.
MNRF background information states that removing just a few wolves from each pack will not decrease overall predation on moose and that only wiping out wolf packs in their entirety will achieve this. (Pack eradication is most often done by aerial killing or poisoning — thankfully these options aren’t on the table.)
There are many uncertainties around the causes of recent moose declines. Climate change might be playing a role, as might disease (often exacerbated by climate change). One thing is clear, though: hunting by humans is having the most significant impact on moose populations, with ever more moose being killed as hunting-related technology improves.
Citizens throughout Ontario are left wondering what is going on. Why is a ministry responsible for protecting Ontario’s rich biodiversity putting wildlife at risk? Why is a province that advocates tolerance and diversity fanning the age-old flames of intolerance against predators, and advancing harm to the native biodiversity of Ontario?
This regulation has not yet been passed. There’s still time for the province to abandon the proposal and base its policy and approaches to wildlife management on science. If the MNRF wants to please hunters by making it easier for them to kill predators, with less oversight, it should be clear that this is the motivation for the proposed regulation. To suggest that it is to help moose populations is simply senseless.

Alchemia announces in-licensing of FAK inhibitors from CRT | Commercial Partnerships | Cancer Research UK
Brisbane, Australia – Alchemia Limited (ASX: ACL), a drug discovery and development company, has announced the in-licensing of two early-stage novel anticancer drug candidates from Cancer Research Technology (CRT). The preclinical Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) inhibitors originate from the Australian Cancer Therapeutics CRC (CTx) and will be evaluated by Alchemia in various cancer and cancer stem cell models prior to initiation of formal preclinical and clinical development. The two licenses include fees, milestones and royalty payments. Further terms are not disclosed.
“We are looking forward to evaluating these novel molecules and their effect on the tumour environment and cancer stem cells that are essential for the growth, persistence and reoccurrence of cancer,” said Tracey Brown, Alchemia’s Chief Scientific Officer. “We plan to use our established oncology and cancer stem cell models to evaluate the potential clinical benefits of the drugs in vivo prior to initiating further IND enabling studies.”
FAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase which plays an important role in the development and spread of numerous malignancies and has therefore emerged as a promising target in cancer therapy. Inhibition of FAK has the potential to provide numerous therapeutic benefits to cancer patients by disrupting tumour development and metastasis, while overcoming chemo-resistance to a broad variety of currently used cytotoxic drugs. Through these combined therapeutic effects, FAK inhibitors have the potential to treat a range of cancers and may provide a longer lasting clinical response and improved patient outcomes.
“Alchemia is excited about the in-licensing of these two novel compounds as it will enable our Melbourne-based oncology research team to further evaluate and advance these assets,” said Thomas Liquard CEO of Alchemia. "CRT has a stellar reputation for scientific innovation and we are proud that CRT/CTx selected Alchemia to progress these FAK inhibitors.”
“CTx was funded under the Australian CRC Program to bridge the gap between excellent Australian research and the discovery of new drugs based on that research,” said Warwick Tong, Chief Executive Officer of CTx. “We are excited to see the first drug candidates from our novel pipeline move towards the next stage of their development in the hands of one of Australia’s leading innovative biotech companies.”
Alchemia is a drug discovery and development company marketing FDA approved fondaparinux, an injectable antithrombotic in the US, as well as other major markets via partner Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories. The Company is also developing a late stage oncology product pipeline with multiple ongoing trials through its proprietary HyACT drug delivery platform, which targets anti-cancer drugs to solid tumours. Lead asset HA-Irinotecan is in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. HA-Irinotecan is also in two Phase II investigator-sponsored trials, one of which is in collaboration with Merck Serono combining HA-Irinotecan with Erbitux® (cetuximab). Alchemia is also exploring additional small molecule drug discovery targets via an internal discovery platform VAST, based on the Company’s deep chemistry expertise. The VAST technology is being developed in collaboration with leading academic institutions and is partnered with AstraZeneca AB.
Cancer Therapeutics CRC (CTx) is a small molecule drug discovery company that is translating innovative cancer biology research into lead and preclinical stage drug candidates. In particular it is targeting novel cancer pathways associated with the tumour microenvironment or growth, and to develop novel treatments for breast, prostate, melanoma, lung and brain cancers. Located in Melbourne, Australia, the Company was founded in January 2007 through a collaboration between a number of Australia's leading research institutions, and commercial organisations and CRT. Further information can be found at www.cancercrc.com.

I try to be a responsible New Yorker, as a small step toward being a good global citizen. I live the old adage, “think global, act local.” But the world is so big, so complicated, so varied, that it’s hard to feel connected and part of the solution. And yet, the terrifying backdrop of global politics, the ugly rhetoric of presidential candidates, the city’s insane cost of living and my inability to keep up with it, takes its toll.
I moved to New York in the late 90s for the same reason so many come to its shores: its crackling creative energy. Brooklyn became home because my best friend from college grew up in Midwood, and after sharing her parents’ garage for a summer, Manhattan seemed an expensive world away. One day as we were unpacking boxes, another New York transplant, Hal, gave me an enduring piece of advice. “If you ever feel beat down by the city, go for a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge,” he said. “The skyline and the water will give you a new perspective. It always works for me.”
Coming from a small college town where I felt I didn’t fit in (like so many other New Yorkers), here was a patch of asphalt where I could become anyone I wanted to be, or at least the person that was stuck trying to fit into my hometown culture. And so I did and was. I was a designer for many years before pivoting towards art and public projects. Working as an art director for Metropolis magazine from 2003 to 2007 gave me a front row seat to one of the biggest architectural and planning booms the city had seen in the past 100 years, and made me realize how much I loved the ideas of cities. And although I also believed New York was a city amongst cities—special in its brand of intellectual and physical vigor—I left the city four times between 1997 and 2009, each time with the potential of no return.
And yet, I returned this last time, in 2011, ready to admit that I’m too much of a New Yorker to live anywhere else. Having lived in Austin, Toronto, San Francisco, and the Netherlands—places I love very much— I missed the very particular social MO of the city: New Yorkers are uniquely open to human contact. In these other cities, my eye contact was rebuffed, my smile was overlooked, my irrepressible need to trade thoughts on the drunk Santa boarding the bus completely ignored. Seems it’s just not something strangers in other cities do. Turns out, I love New York because when a woman trips on the West 4th street subway stairs, everyone near her stops to help: they ask her if she’s OK, offer to call for help, collect the pocket change that exploded out of her pockets and inform her when they are placing it back in her pocket. They are there for her, not because they stand to gain anything, but because the city is hard enough, for all of us. The guys who run Ziad’s (of Motherless Brooklyn fame) around the corner from my first apartment still remember me after 10 years, ask me if I’ve been working out (we used to go to the same sports club), and after we’ve caught up a little bit with each other, I’m offered a free coffee, light not sweet. They remember that, too.
We all live in apartments that are impossibly small and deeply imperfect. We do so because Jane Jacobs was right. The mixed and vital density of the city offers us an expanded home.
To the shock and incredulity of our family and friends from out of town, we all live in apartments that are impossibly small and deeply imperfect. We do so because Jane Jacobs was right. The mixed and vital density of the city offers us an expanded home—from our next-door neighbors, to the businesses in our neighborhood, to the farther flung territories of our daily routines and social centers. It’s a city made of real people, people who will engage.
It’s also a city made from and on the water. The city charter designates that all waterfront structures must be approved by the Small Business Services. This is because once upon a time, all the business conducted in the city was on the water. The unique geography of this city was its destiny. The special interplay of climate, land and water created optimal conditions for people to call this place home, providing food, shelter, protection, transportation, and more than enough coastline for the commercial exchange of goods.
For the first 10 years I lived in New York, I may have registered the historic role of the water to the city’s founding, but I didn’t know it’s extent. I never thought about the water, except that, being a Brooklynite, the water defined my difference, my outerboroughness. The water was something I had to get over or under every day to work in Manhattan.
Having spent a significant amount of time in Shockoe Bottom’s cobble-stoned flood zone of the James River in Richmond, Virginia, Red Hook always felt like home to me. And after crossing underneath the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, it seemed there was water at the end of most streets. Before I moved to Red Hook, I never felt before that I was living on islands, or that the water lived in the city. And that was exciting until, in the summer heat I found myself teased by it. Red Hook has a tiny beach, one of the few places one can wade into the water, but I’d been warned about the water’s toxicity, and a horror list of things that could happen to me if I swam in it. There was so much water, but nothing that could be done with it.
A fascination with Governors Island and Buttermilk Channel, lead me to the offices of the Brooklyn Eagle, Walt Whitman’s old newspaper. There, I read about a walkable sandbar that once joined the two that included a reference to farmers leading cows across that shallow water.
A converging fascination with Governors Island and Buttermilk Channel, the waterway between it and Brooklyn, lead me to the offices of the Brooklyn Eagle, Walt Whitman’s old newspaper. There, I read about a walkable sandbar that once joined the two that included a reference to farmers leading cows across that shallow water. That image was so powerful: the idea of being able to roll up my pant legs and walk out into the harbor sparked an irrepressible idea: I would build a floating bridge to remake that walk. My feet wouldn’t get wet, but I would move across the Channel on my own volition, free from the subway and ferry schedules, and feel the water beneath me. We could be in conversation with one another. From the first spark of the idea, I could see the bridge in my mind; it would be a simple floating structure, about as wide as the boardwalk on the Brooklyn Bridge. It would be a new kind of Brooklyn Bridge created by a New Yorker for all her fellow New Yorkers. I called it Citizen Bridge.
Artists have all sorts of processes: mine can be described as “concrete journalism.” To understand the permissions system of the waterways, the issues at stake, structural engineering and hydrodynamics, I reached out to everyone I knew who I thought might know someone with that knowledge. Mary Mattingly, artist of the visionary project Waterpod, connected me with the U.S. Coast Guard. I met with them in the first week and showed an early collection of sketches outlining potential design approaches, ranging from bamboo to inflatable rafts to floating concrete and human-sized hamster balls. Without commenting on my sketches, they explained that Buttermilk Channel is a navigable waterway, meaning vessels are allowed to move through it, and that my project would obstruct navigation.
Because there is an alternate route around the western edge of Governors Island, they offered the possibility of closing Buttermilk Channel for a 24-hour period. They also unfolded the permitting process for a Marine Event—temporary water-based happenings like July 4th fireworks are permitted as Marine Events—which requires 135 days minimum to execute, including 60 days allotted for public comment. The residency on Governors Island I had just begun was about 145 days, so I left with those two pieces of information: I needed to understand the concerns of all those with interests on the waterways, and I had to work fast to design a modular floating structure that could be built on land and quickly installed.
Those first few months were an intensive education in understanding the basics of distance, materials, buoyancy, tides and currents. I made my own 1200-foot tape measure to understand just how long the bridge would have to span. Some calculations showed that it’s about the same distance as six city blocks. I luckily found a bridge engineer who was excited by the idea and game to spend time teaching me some of these basic ideas over beers. I invited architects to my studio to brainstorm materials and construction techniques. I made more sketches and scoured the internet for ideas. Over the first six months, I’d built a community of practice around the project. I’d spoken with members of regulatory agencies, architects and bridge engineers, carpenters, members of the local maritime community, and teachers and students. Needless to say, halfway through those 135 days, I still had no final design, but I had learned enough to know that this was no six month project. I’d be lucky if it could be completed in six years.
Days after our team—a bridge engineer, a friend, and I—tested the first prototype at Red Hook’s tiny beach, Superstorm Sandy devastated the neighborhood, and countless others along the coastline. Flood waters are cruel in their capacity to fill every nook, crack and corner, and it takes a huge amount of labor to clean up after them. My experience of the togetherness and sense of shared purpose over those days and weeks in Red Hook was buoying.The destructive capacity of the water is great, but so is the human capacity for cooperation and support.
Water is necessarily cooperative. Whether it be on a boat, or after a flood, its force requires requires coordinated cooperation for survival. I’ve noticed this in studying sailing shanties, which were sung to synchronize a crew’s labor—so that all members row at the same time or hoist sail lines with unified effort. I’ve also experienced this when working with students at the Harbor School on Governors Island, a high school whose curriculum is marine-based. Students, in addition to learning English and math, also study vessel operations, scuba diving, and aquaculture. Whenever they’re on the dock or the water, the students cease to be teenagers and become a crew. Everyone has a role, and everyone works together for the good of the group. Mary Mattingly has remarked that being out on the water keeps everything in perspective. Whatever conflicts might be aboard, they are quickly forgotten in order to tend to the immediate needs of the vessel and the water.
New York turned its back on the water in the mid 20th century, and now it’s coming back for us. But I don’t consider this a dark prediction; there is an opportunity in this moment for all of us who live in coastal cities.
Though scientists, activists and artists—including very close friends—have made climate change the focus of their work for many years now, Superstorm Sandy charted a new course in my awareness. It made me realize that New Yorkers are living in a sinking city. I find myself imagining the next flood— reminding myself that it’s not a matter of if, but when. So day-to day while I’m trying to mitigate my environmental footprint to help the climate, I also think about how it might change our daily lives in the city. Specifically, I’m thinking about the water. New York City turned its back on the water in the mid 20th century, and now it’s coming back for us. But I don’t consider this a dark prediction; there is an opportunity in this moment for all those who live in coastal cities.
We’re in a moment of complete disconnection to the water. Interacting with the water was once a matter of course for New Yorkers—and for citizens of coastal cities everywhere. Fishing and gathering food, bathing one’s body, travel, swimming for recreation: these were activities everyone engaged in. Growing up near the water meant knowing about tides and currents, the behaviors of fish, the implications of certain clouds, wind, or other storm predictors. It’s a difficult negative feedback loop we’re in: we’re fearful of the water because we don’t know about it, but the risk seems too high to engage with it to learn about it.
The opportunity I see in reclaiming the waterways as a public space is the renewed sense of citizenship rooted in place. Without a doubt we’re global citizens living in a shared political economy, which requires a certain amount of cosmopolitanism. But we’re also citizens of a very particular place with very rich histories and provocative future possibilities. Accessing those future possibilities means relearning from history, and getting our hands—and feet—wet. It also means actively taking on “the future,” not as something that will inevitably happen to us, but as something that we, a group of people living together in a shared space, make together.
Building a bridge is my way of taking this idea on: it’s bringing an idea inspired by history into conversation with the future. It is, in effect, an alternate future incarnate in steel and plywood, and a question about how we want to live on the water: what is both possible and preferable? And it shouldn’t just be me asking that question. Everyone should be asking that question and should be empowered to turn to others for help when inspiration strikes. Innovation isn’t owned by visionaries or corporations. It’s in all of us, when we feel supported to express our wildest ideas.
Citizenship in the 21st century coastal city is the care and cooperation we show one another and our surroundings. Care is taking time to learn about one another (nature included) It’s finding the courage to embrace the predictions and find the opportunity in them–to face uncertainty with an improvisational “yes, and…”
The process of developing this temporary pedestrian bridge could also be called Building A Thousand Tiny Bridges—those between me and all those who have offered time, expertise, or ideas. It also includes the moments I’ve spent with the water: rowing a boat through Buttermilk Channel, sailing on large craft, wading in at Valentino Pier to test a prototype, kayaking, and helping businesses clean out oily, gritty floodwaters. It’s changed my idea of what Citizenship means—an idea that I suppose is what’s kept me in New York all along. Citizenship in a 21st century coastal city is the care and cooperation we show one another and our surroundings. Care is taking time to learn about one another (nature included). It’s finding the courage to embrace the predictions and find the opportunity in them—to face uncertainty with an improvisational “yes, and….”
Last summer a team of nearly twenty—structural engineers, marine engineers, contract and environmental lawyers, architects, and advisors with experience in mobile art projects and city regulations—tested the first fully engineered prototype. We had spent eight months working on the re-design of the previous version so that it would withstand the tide, current, wave, and wind forces of the channel, while supporting the estimated foot traffic of nearly 8,000 people. On the day of the test, our team, assembled at 6 am under the Brooklyn sunrise, rushed to finish all the final details before the crane arrived to put the pieces together and into the water. I was so nervous, I felt nauseous. But I had nothing to fear, because the team put their best expertise forward, and the section performed just as anticipated.
Before lifting the pieces out of the water, I was urged to stand on the section and be towed out into the harbor. Standing out there, on this (seemingly) simple set of platforms, moving in time with the gentle waves of the afternoon, I couldn’t contain the emotion of the moment. I realized that I wasn’t alone: the water was with me (not against me). It was just as powerful and intimate as I had been dreaming all these years. The generosity and enthusiasm of all those who I’ve met and who have willingly donated their time, coming together to bring the vision so far, is a clear symbol to me that—despite current economic and political rhetoric—we’re living in a time of bridges, not walls.

July 29 (UPI) — The Navy will commission the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Rafael Peralta in a ceremony this morning at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego.
Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Robert Neller will be present to deliver the primary address and the mother of the ship’s namesake, Ms. Rose Maria Peralta, will serve as its sponsor.
The new destroyer is named for Marine Corps Sgt. Rafael Peralta, who was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for heroism for protecting fellow Marines during the second Battle of Fallujah in Iraq. After being badly wounded by enemy gunfire during house-to-house fighting, Peralta covered an enemy grenade with his own body to absorb the blast and save the two Marines with him.
“During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Sgt. Peralta acted heroically and sacrificed himself for his fellow Marines,” acting Secretary of the Navy Sean Stackley said in a statement.
“He was proud to be an American, proud to be a Marine and we are proud to welcome USS Rafael Peralta to the fleet.”
The Peralta will be the 64th Arleigh Burke-class ship to enter service with the U.S. Navy. It will have the newest version of the AEGIS Weapons System that, combined with the AN/SPY-1D radar, can track and engage aircraft, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles simultaneously.
June 23 (UPI) — A radar and laser beam system for detecting and destroying drones has been unveiled at the Paris Air Show by Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd.
The system, called Drone Dome, has a range of up to several miles and causes minimal interruptions to other systems in nearby urban areas, the company said during at the Paris Air Show.
“The threat posed by drones and packs of drones is one of the most complex challenges confronting us,” reserve Brig. Gen. Meir Ben Shaya, manager of Rafael’s Business Development, Air division, told Globes. “We have seen ISIS and other groups using them and the entire world is looking for a solution.”
“We have taken the laser systems developed by Rafael and adapted them to cope with this threat, which is such a major challenge for defense systems worldwide.”
Rafael says the system’s radar identifies targets, while its laser system destroys them. Drone Dome also features a jamming system for disrupting communications between the drone and its operator.

Pegasus Mail v4.51 is now available for unrestricted public distribution - please visit http://www.pmail.com for downloads and information, or check the download pages here at the community. The release version has had significant work since the public beta at the end of last year, and has some powerful new capabilities, most notably the addition of autofiltering folders.
The release of v4.51 marks the end of one of the most difficult development periods in the history of the program, and it seems appropriate that it should coincide with my attempts to ensure the long-term survival of the package: from here, development should be both easier and faster, and I do not anticipate ever again having such a long delay between releases. Your assistance is crucial to making this happen though, and if you haven't already done so, I would ask that you read the open letter at the main web site and see if you are able to help.

“The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in times of great moral crises maintain their neutrality”
The Waconia High School girls basketball team was on fire earlier this month as it recorded two 100-point games—in back-to-back fashion.
According to the Sun Patriot, the Wildcats toppled Blake 100-36 Dec. 2, and then just two days later beat Chanhassen 110-101. During the Blake game, junior Madelin Dammann led a stellar defensive effort with nine steals, and the team as a whole had a whopping 40 steals during the game. As for the Chanhassen game, the win was a huge victory considering Chan boasts two players that are headed for Division I schools.

´We are all used to music that “draws on previous traditions”. Sometimes that means in reality that there is craftsmanship rather than artistry at work. In my own improvisations, I am sometimes satisfied with a decent result but I could never claim a distinctive or original voice is evident.
John’s work, on the contrary, is unified by a unique and unmistakable voice. His music repays the attention required to perform it with continuingly evolving vistas. The musical language owes something to the naivety of folk music and, through that to an older, pre diatonic tradition but the striking thing about it is its novelty. There is a clear intellectual framework underpinning the work that becomes more evident with repeated hearing. Despite the scarcity of the usual melodic and harmonic anchoring points, I found it rewarding to sing and a revelation to explore.´
´Having sung the parts of Caiaphas and the Voice of God in John Middleton’s St John Passion, recently first performed, it is quite apparent to me that a new captivating style of writing matched with a different style of creating vocal line and complementary orchestration came together to create something exciting, vibrant and of profound spiritual value. To sing the work was actually a spiritual experience, capturing the text and expressing profound Johannine sentiments in a very creative way. A work to be taken very seriously into the future.´
´I have been privileged to have been invited to take on major roles in numerous World Premières in the past, amongst which feature song cycles, oratorios, the first modern performances of three early operas by Stradella and Colonna, the World Student Premiere of Stravinski’s Les Noces, the contemporary outdoor/interactive installation operatic venture ´Out of the Blue´ for the Seachange Trust at Great Yarmouth, ‘The Last Broadcast’, and the ´5K Opera´ which was broadcast on Channel 4 television in the UK and in San Francisco.
But none of these come close to the challenge I faced when performing the role of Jesus in John Middleton´s ´Saint John Passion´ in March this year, 2013.
This new work by John Middleton is a truly seminal work which demanded a meticulous approach to the preparation of the music, a deep understanding of the biblical text and a very close liaison with the composer over a period of over 18 months.
Musically very difficult in its atonal sections, vocally demanding in the length and variety of the musical styles, frequent key and time signature changes and vocal colours required and a tour de force for any singer´s concentration, it was a significant demand in every aspect of a singer´s armoury.
However, this was easily the most rewarding experience of my singing career to date. For me the SJP was a remarkable combination of the very personal involvement felt in performing the role of Gerontius, the sublime musicality found in the music of Bach´s setting of the same Passion and the technical difficulty of Britten´s War Requiem.
Above all, it was the intense personal feelings it evoked during its performance that I recall the most, which, after all the emotional output, left me in a heap of tears in the green room upon its conclusion.
With its Symphonic and Concertante structure, with solo voices in subtly varied and constantly changing vocal and instrumental ensemble, the welding together melody with recitative aria and an almost Wagnerian thematic style of text delivery this work is very different from much I have sung before.
As far as I am aware this setting of the Biblical text has never been undertaken before in that it utilises only the spoken words from the St John Passion, which gives an extra impact that could not have been generated by a more traditional use of the text.
Every part of the work has something for both the listener and performer and on the evening in question I received many kind compliments upon my interpretation of the work and many more in praise of the composer John Middleton whose inspiration and dedication to his composition lead to a truly remarkable World Première of The Saint John Passion.
Many of my other Premières have turned out to be just one off performances, never to be heard again, but this grand opus deserves a second, if not many more hearings, for it has so much to offer in so many ways. I just hope that when the time comes, John will feel that I did sufficient justice to his work the first time that he asks me to become Jesus once again. For me, that would be a real labour of love and one well worth the effort.´
Today marks the Persian New Year. Nowruz translated means: “New day.” It’s celebrated across by Persians around the world, and this year falls on the first full day of spring here in Canada.

Chapter 13 also makes it easier to repay debt since it effectively consolidates all the listed debt into one payment that can be made to the trustee monthly. In the case of what’s called a “cramdown,” Chapter 13 may even allow a debtor to reduce the amount owed on their secured debt by reducing the balance to match the value of the underlying collateral and effectively reducing the interest.
Generally speaking, Chapter 13 is designed for debtors who have assets that they want to keep while still declaring bankruptcy. But, as noted above, the value of certain nonexempt assets or those used to secure debts listed in the bankruptcy may be added to the overall payment. The debtor can decide whether to then liquidate those assets or find other ways to pay off their value.

There’s a way to boost your credit score that doesn’t involve paying down debt or any of the other more traditional score boosting tactics. Since credit scores are determined, in part, on the difference between your credit limit and the amount of credit you use, ask for a higher credit limit. Your chances of increasing it are likely better than you think. Of those who apply for a higher credit limit, 8 out of 10 are approved, according to a recent Bankrate Money Pulse Survey. While it helps to be over 30, odds are good for all adults. To avoid having your credit diminished by asking for a higher limit, ask for the highest credit line increase that won't trigger what's called a hard inquiry. (See also: Credit Score: Hard vs. Soft Inquiry.)
Ultimately, the best way to consolidate credit card debt depends on your financial situation. If you want a quick application process and the potential for no fees, you may choose a balance transfer credit card. Meanwhile, if you don’t have the good or excellent credit needed for a balance transfer credit card, you may look toward loans. If that’s the case, the question becomes whether you’re willing to put your home up for collateral to get a potentially higher loan amount, or withdraw from your 401(k) or simply receive cash from an unsecured option like a personal loan. And, if you struggle with managing payments for various credit card debts, you may lean toward a debt management plan. Whichever option you settle on, make sure you have an actionable plan that allows you to fully repay the loan during the term and maintain a debt-free life.
If following the steps above seems daunting, some organizations specialize in paid credit repair services. Most of the services require a monthly subscription fee between $60-$100 per month, and most reviews report that the negative items are completely removed within 3-5 months. Despite the high cost, legitimate companies provide a valuable service if you’ve been the victim of identity theft and you want someone else to do the work for you.
Are you thinking that the best way to improve your credit score is through transferring balances multiple times? If you, this tactic will leave you in more debt and a lower credit score. There are numerous fees and rates that vary across companies, all of which are counterproductive. Your path to fast credit repair should include minimal, if any, balance transfers.
Improving your credit score is a bit like losing weight: It takes a while. Unless there are major errors on your credit report that you can easily get erased, there is no quick fix. Often, it takes at least a couple years to go from a low score to a high one. But at least, you'll be improving your financial position, and building up good financial habits, in the interim.
I have approximate $15,000 in high interest credit card debt and just spinning my wheels making minimum monthly payments. My credit is borderline fair/good. Would credit counseling help me pay this off quicker?? I just recently leased a brand new car for 3 years and when the time comes to trade it in or finance it and keep it I want my credit to be okay to do so. What do you recommend for me??

Don’t try to transfer debt between two cards of the same bank. It won’t work. Balance transfer deals are meant to ‘steal’ your balance from a competing bank, not lower your rate from the same bank. So if you have a Chase Freedom® with a high rate, don’t apply for another Chase card like a Chase Slate® and expect you can transfer the balance. Apply for one from another bank.
If your average monthly income for the six-month period leading up to your bankruptcy filing is less than the median income for the same-size household in your state, you automatically qualify. If your income is above the median, you must pass an additional means test that compares your income to specific monthly expenses to prove you have little to no disposable income.
Repairing your credit includes paying off those debt collection accounts. Until you do, you face relentless calls and letters from debt collectors. While you can take action to stop debt collector calls, collection accounts often move from one debt collector to another. When a new collector gets your debt, you’ll have to go through the process of sending letters to stop the calls all over again.
All very good information.... but I am not sure that getting a credit offer with a pre approval doesn't recheck your credit when you actually apply. Every credit card I signed up for did a credit inquiry.... however.... I really like your advice about adding your daughter to your accounts... this doesnt put a hard inquiry on her credit report and it makes it look like the card is hers. She doesn't even have to use it but it will make her score jump. Great advice
Bad credit is not a life sentence, which is good news for the roughly one-third of people with credit scores below 620. So if your credit is damaged, there are indeed steps that you can take to rebuild. After all, rebuilding credit is a process that takes time and requires focus on the fundamentals. And we’ll explain exactly what you need to do below.
Thank you. I thought my scores were better than they are and I contacted a mortgage lender who said my scores were much lower than I thought. He said to pay off all negative open accounts. Most are medical bills. He also said that even with a car loan and a secured card and Fingerhut it is not enough trade lines. He suggested I open another secured card. Use one for gas and the other for fun/groceries. He said charge no more than 30% on each only if there is the money present to pay it off when I get home that day. If so, pay all but $5 immediately. He said that plus the debt should help within a few months to raise my score in addition to keeping the existing items current. My husband has a tax lien so I promptly made arrangements for that and have applied for and was approved for a second secured card as well. I just have to wait until payday to fund it and then will work to pay off these debts and build my score. Hoping for some big results in six months.
“Credit repair leverages your legal right to three standards: Credit reports must be 100% accurate, entirely fair, and fully substantiated,” Padawer said. “Too many lesser credit repair companies skip over those last two standards — which involve communicating with your creditors — in favor of depending upon simple credit bureau disputes by themselves.”
If you are a candidate for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, you will need to complete mandatory pre-filing credit counseling with an approved credit counseling agency. During this step, a credit counselor will go over your income, debts and regular bills to determine your best options, including alternatives to bankruptcy. The cost of this type of credit counseling session is typically $50 to $100.
A credit card could very well be the source of your credit-score sorrow. But it’s also your score’s best chance at recovery. You can’t remove negative records that are accurate from your credit reports. So the best you can hope for is to devalue them with a steady flow of positive information. And credit cards are perfect for the job because anyone can get them, they can be free to use, and they don’t force you to go into debt. Plus, they report information to the major credit bureaus on a monthly basis.
Cons: You lower your retirement savings, and you may have to pay income taxes and an early withdrawal penalty if you’re younger than 59 ½. Also, you can usually only borrow up to 50 percent of your account balance (up to $50,000), and you must pay back the money within five years unless you’re using it to buy a home that will be your principal residence.
How it works: Once you choose the secured card you prefer, you’ll open an account under your child’s name. If your teen is approved, the bank will ask for a security deposit. Most secured cards require deposits of at least $200, but there are secured cards with security deposits as low as $49. That deposit typically becomes their line of credit. For example, if the minimum security deposit is $200, the line of credit will also be $200.
Beyond that is creditor information, which makes up most of your reports. This includes different accounts you have (loans, credit cards, etc.), their status (open/closed, in collections), balances, credit limits and payment details. This may also include dates of missed payments or late payments, or when the accounts were sent to collections. From these details, your credit scores will be formed.
This is a capital adequacy ratio that measures total assets (less other liabilities) to total shares. A ratio over 100 means that a credit union has enough assets to pay all obligations to creditors and members, if liquidation occurs.
This Capital Adequacy ratio measures net worth in relation to total assets. Net worth cushions fluctuations in earnings, supports growth, and provides protection against insolvency. The rate of net worth growth should be commensurate with the levels of risk and asset growth.
An earnings ratio that measures annualized YTD net income in relation to average assets. This ratio measures the efficient utilization of assets to create profits YTD. A positive ratio indicates that earnings were sufficient to cover the institution's cost of funds and operating expenses(including for loan loss expense) as well as providing a profit. For State, Regional, State and Peer Class groups, the aggregate statistic is computed by summing net income and average assets across credit unions within each group and calculating the ratio.

I just love my friend Sara Lou Cooper. She sends out a cue a week to keep me engaged in my life. This week, the cue was themed “What they think.”
when I let myself wallow, stuck in the wrong place, behind the eight ball, a person who never misses a chance to miss a chance, a victim of a long history of uninspired choices, afraid of my own shadow, and pretty much a waste of space.
when I'm not in a bad place, under-appreciated, under-utilized, unable to communicate my value such that I can engage others, and just unable to make a difference.
when I am in a good place, making a difference in other people's lives, and adding value that is appreciated and changing the course of the world, but still worried that I am on the wrong path.
most of the time, a great dad; this is the one thing I know I've got right, except when it comes to setting an example of leading a life of fulfillment, satisfaction, inspiration, excitement, and fearlessness. There, I still have work to do.
thoughtful, kind, smart, wise, different, creative, attentive, knowledgeable, compassionate, direct, faithful, loving, and, when I'm not getting in my own way, capable, persistent, and unrelenting, especially when it comes to others
But for all that, here's the thing about what I think or what I think other people think. All that goes out the window when I am in action. When I am engaged, and particularly when I am in a state of flow, the thoughts fall into the background, and I actually get to make the impact that I otherwise might think about.
So now I want you to do something, for me as well as for you. I am not coaching enough, and I want to be action. If you are here, this is probably true for you too. So do us both a favor. Carve out an hour and schedule a consultation with me. Use coupon code GreatValue to get your consultation for $50 instead of $500. If we choose to work together, it's a call a week (anywhere from 15 minutes to as long as it takes), taking one week off a month, with e-mail and phone availability as needed outside of our regular call.
As my answers above suggest, I am an expert as self-sabotage and making my life harder than it needs to be. This gives me a keen eye for other's tendencies to do the same. I am also clear that the path out of this is action that honors the commitments in our lives.
What you get is a powerful coach to push you into the zone of adventure and out-sized results, in all the domains in your life. What I get is another set of actions I can put in my calendar to make the world the kind of place I think it ought to be.
David and Sharleen help people create the lives they want, now. We hope that what you find here helps you do that. We further hope that when you are ready to take your life to the next level, you talk to one of us to see s/he is the right coach for you.

If you have read our stuff for awhile you will know that I am not just a believer in "Revival". And nor just "Reformation" either. I am a believer in the fullness of Christ's glorious Church - the Bride of Christ displayed before all the world in her full purity and power. The sad thing is, we have never seen anything like that in our lifetime.
Of course we see this glorious church in the Book of Acts - in places like Jerusalem and Antioch. And we get glimpses of her again down through history - in times of "Great Awakening".
The glorious Bride of Christ tends not to meet in 'cathedrals'. She does not shut herself away from the world behind four walls. She is out amongst the poor and needy - preaching the pure gospel, helping the widows, praying for the sick. Just like Jesus was not hidden away, she is not hidden away.
A lot of people think that "House churches" are the most biblical form of church structure. (I am a fan of House churches myself). But we need to realize that the true church was born in the open air. She was born in "Solomon's Porch". She was born in the 'Courtyard of the Gentiles'. A lot of people do not understand this - and so miss something very significant.
The Bible says that the early church in Jerusalem met every day in the huge temple courtyard - a massive open-air space about the size of five football fields. There were "porticos" all around the edge - and "Solomon's Porch" was the one where the apostles would stand and preach. Where do you think all those miracles were done? Where do you think the 'Gate Beautiful' was - where the lame man was healed? Where do you think Jesus drove out the money-changers? Where do you think Jesus Himself preached when He was in Jerusalem? -In the 'Courtyard of the Gentiles'.
The early church was an "open air" church and a "house meeting" church. There was no such thing as 'cathedrals' or church buildings for centuries. She fed the widows, she clothed the orphans, she preached a pure gospel to the poor. She did miracles in the open air.
This is the glorious church that Jesus is wanting to display again before the end. This is His beautiful Bride - in all her fullness. And my friends, we simply cannot afford to settle for less.
What got me thinking again along these lines was this earthquake in the city of Christchurch. A lot of the old cathedrals and church buildings there have been seriously damaged. Maybe it is time to leave them behind. Maybe it is time for Christ's glorious church to come forth again - outside the walls that are blocking us from the very world we are called to reach.
Regarding The Lord's Sabbath in the LAST days and at the end of the age, Jesus instructed His followers, "But pray ye that your flight be NOT in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day:..." Matthew 24:20
But Followers of Jesus are saved by grace, so can't we ignore the Lord's Commands, at least the Commandment to honor His Sabbath and to keep it Holy?
Jesus said, "Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."Matthew 5:19
Never mind everyone, we realised our mistake in completing the EE profile, phew that was a big stress! Biggest relief ever! Best of luck to everyone else :-)
Hi everyone, I have a strange question that is quite unique. I started applying for my PR and towards the end of the stages started a relationship which I did not include at that stage as anything could still happen and my medical was about to expire. We thought to apply for his PR separately and add my details with my current PR status, rather than going the sponsorship route, but now much to our surprise, see his score is only 429, which is too low for a quick draw. We really want to arrive at the same time, and so wanted to apply for a PR rather than sponsorship and then an open working permit. Our question now is whether it is possible to apply for a visitors permit before applying I land there, and then applying for sponsorship from that side? We basically just want to land at the same time and start there at the same time. Appreciate any feedback in advance. Thanks Rene

Predating Christianity, the oldest examples of the cross were found in a cave in the French Pyrenees and dated to 10,000 BC. The first crosses bore tribute to the sun, the divine center of the universe. An ancient and universal symbol, the cross is also associated with the Tree of Life: the vertical line representing a spiritual path from the earth to the heavens, the horizontal arms, the physical world. In the center, the lines meet, creating a balanced circle where all forces unite.

I took my little brother (his girlfriend and friend Matt) out to Ventura this Saturday for a gig. The venue was a little bar & grill called Take 2 off of Main ST. At first visit, it did not seem to be conducive to a performance by The Rozzes — walking in felt like a scene from a movie. You know, that scene where the main characters walk into the bar and all the regulars stop what they are doing to glue their eyes to the foreign visitors. We had an hour to kill so we went to the Ventura Mall to watch everything close down before heading back to the venue. This time the rest of the family had arrived and the crowed seemed to be a bit younger and more music-ready. The Rozzes put on another good show and then we headed back home. My little brother turned 20 on the ride back just after track 6 of the new Circa Survive Album.
Gray Fowler, star NFL tight end, is being pursued by a stalker, so his team hires a protection agency to keep Gray under the watch of a bodyguard at all times. When Gray meets Dru Porter, an agent assigned to him, he's indignant. How can an attractive young female half his size possibly protect him?
But Dru's a former Marine, an expert markswoman, and a black belt. She's also ferociously determined to uncover the identity of Gray's stalker. And she's just as determined to avoid any kind of romantic attachment between herself and the rugged football player with the mysterious past.
But the closer they get to finding the stalker, the closer they grow to each other. As the danger rises, can Dru and Gray entrust their hearts--and their lives--to one another?
If you've been a fan since the beginning (like me), then you've met the boys of the family: Bo, Ty, and Jake. Well, move over, big brothers, because it's little sister's turn to shine! Dru Porter is the baby of the family, and the youngest by several years.
She's all girl, but she's as tough as her brothers--in fact, all four Porter siblings served in the military. Now Dru works private security, and she is definitely the one you want watching your back!
Gray Fowler is a tight end for a pro football team, and he believes his own press. He's a force on the field, but he intends to catch Dru's heart and carry it to the end zone. But first they need to secure Gray's safety.
I've enjoyed all of Becky's books, but this is my favorite. Her writing feels effortlessly, which means she's both really talented and works hard to give her readers quality fiction. The faith message in "Her One and Only" is powerful, but not forced. And the sparks that fly between Dru and Gray are more fun than the Fourth of July!
I highly recommend the entire series...if you've never read any of Becky's novels please start with Bo's story. A major thread in HOAO deals with Meg and Bo: fans will be excited, and new readers don't want to spoil their surprise by starting with Dru's tale.

Letting his musical talent speak for itself, DJ Shy is determined to set himself apart from the rest in the industry. Being his own toughest critic, this young professional strives on perfecting his skills, and mastering the art of mixing; constructing innovative creations that are bound to turn heads. Whether you’ve seen him play live, or have listened to one of his mixes, DJ Shy is dedicated to his artistry, and will prove that his skills, passion and ambition deserves to be recognized, locally and worldwide.
Born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, one of the most diverse places in the world, DJ Shy has grown to appreciate and love an abundance of cultures and genres of music, which ultimately plays a role in his ability to be versatile and unique. Being raised in a Trinidadian household, DJ Shy initially developed his allegiance to soca and calypso, two genres that are very dear to his heart. His father, a music fanatic, also exposed him to reggae, disco, pop, oldies, R&B, etc., developing his interests at an early age. With his unquestionable love for music and the support of his parents and friends, DJ Shy took his interests to the next level, when he acquired his own set of DJequipment, ultimately starting the journey of his professional DJ career.
Devoting most of his time on practicing his mixing and scratching skills, DJ Shy realized that he had the ability to turn his dreams into reality, by keeping a good work ethic and staying humble, yet determined. Teaming up with a few friends from high school, “360 Entertainment,” was created- a sound crew that would play at school dances, and house parties, mainly catering to peers their age. Eventually being recognized for his talents, DJ Shy started getting booked for all ages events, and occasionally 19+ events, by local promoters and venues. Accepting as many gigs as possible, and endlessly working to surpass expectations, DJ Shy started getting bigger opportunities throughout Toronto, and other big cities in Ontario. Before he knew it, he was being booked for parties he dreamt about DJing at while attending them, and was working alongside some of his idols: Dr. Jay, Private Ryan, D’Bandit, Jester, E-Man, Spex, etc.
By joining forces with some of the veterans in the industry, it was helping to open doors he’s been dreaming of, and DJ Shy was determined to make the most out of it. DJ Shy has been featured on big name parties, at venues and on boat rides, he has made appearances at successful weekly parties, he frequently DJ’s at Socacize, and on broadcasted radio shows, and he has partaken in 24DJs, not once, but twice. Aside from accomplishing his goals of working with his idols, DJ Shy has also collaborated with a few close friends and threw numerous parties of his own, in addition to creating and producing his own mixes that were downloaded by an incredible amount of people.
Having the taste of success in his mouth, DJ Shy is more driven than ever. Appreciative of all of the support and opportunities he has been blessed with over the years, DJ Shy vows to continuously educate himself on the craft of DJing and music production. He attests to please his audience, regardless of age, diversity, size, or location. He believes music is a universal language, and by sharing his love and passion in this form of artistry, DJ Shy hopes to connect with every individual listening, and aspires to create unity amongst people abroad.

These are the 14 best ways to sell your web-site. Some of the markets presented offer completely free web-site listing, other paid web-site listings and other demand success fees.
This is the greatest web-site market in the world. Listing is charged with one-off fees and success fees.
eBay is a huge online market that offers the chance to buy / sell almost anything. Many web-sites and domains are listed for sale at eBay.
There are several online tools that can be used for that job. The most popular tool is certainly Copyscape.com, but there are some good alternatives too. Here are some relative links and relative info.
Domaining as a Business Industry has witnessed great growth rates during the past two decades. This growth has been reflected in both sales activity and the average price of domains sold. As the internet has literately entered every aspect of our life, domain names have become valuable assets like bonds, shares, real estate etc. Some domains have even been sold for millions of US dollars making their owners rich. As the potential for domain flipping is great nowadays, the crucial question for every domainer before buying or selling a domain name is “What is the real value of this Domain?” This is the main issue analyzed in this article.
In order to define real value in a market, we must first identify the factors forming the aggregate demand and supply. Demand for premium and high premium domain names comes mainly from businesses that want to go online or from domain investors that buy domain names cheap to sell them to businesses at a higher price. Many factors define if a domain name is the best choice for naming a business, here are some really important factors:
4) High Organic SEO Value (in other words, the ability to attract free visitors coming from Search Engines)
But there is also another crucial factor for defining the value of a domain, and that factor is scarcity. Scarcity limits the power of supply and that means that if demand suddenly increases, the domain name price can lift up in the sky.
(1) First you break the domain in 2 pieces, one piece defines the market and the other piece defines the brand.
(2) Using past sales and especially recent sales you may create a basic valuation for a domain name. For example, if there is a very similar domain name that has been sold recently for $1,000 (without a site) you have instantly a basic valuation model for your domain.
To make it even more sophisticated we may appraise separately each domain piece from (1) and create a more precise two-piece valuation model.
As mentioned, this method is based on past sales data. You can find past domain sales using several web sites, I use NameBio.com.
(3) The third step is to identify the domain’s extension availability and then define scarcity. First of all, you must check all available extensions. If a domain is registered in 7 different TLDs then the .com gains value and it should be valuated in a premium than if there weren’t any registered domains in other TLDs. If it is a .net you must calculate about 1/5 to 1/7 of the value of the .com domain.
After we have gained knowledge on TLD scarcity we must identify the potential for possible abbreviations or the existence of reversed name. In the previous example of TradingCheap.com, we can also use the domain CheapTrading.com. That means that our domain valuation has just lost 50%.
This step can be used as a method itself. As a general rule, we multiply the value of CPC to the number of exact annual searches to get a basic valuation. Here is The Rosener Equation:
In order to make the appraisal more accurate, we may multiply (i) to the Click-through ratio of the domain name
“If you want to invest in Domains, never register or buy a domain name that is appraised below $450.”
How Companies Plunder and Profit From the Nest Eggs of American Work | Peak Energy & Resources, Climate Change, and the Preservation of Knowledge
We already knew that employers are stealing workers’ pensions, and that they’ve doing it for more than 20 years. But in this well-researched and well-argued book Ellen Schultz, an award-winning investigative reporter for The Wall Street Journal, documents the complex ways in which they’ve been doing it, how they profit from these crimes, and how gaping loopholes in laws and regulations let them get away with it.
Interestingly for UE members, the first corporate leader Schultz mentions is Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of General Electric, recounting a speech he gave to investors in December 2010. Immelt told them that the GE pension “has been a drag for a decade,” and that to relieve itself of this financial burden, GE was going to keep future employees out of the pension. But Immelt’s presentation was fundamentally untrue, says Schultz – the company’s pension and retiree plans, huge and well-funded, “had contributed billions of dollars to the company’s bottom line over the past decade and a half”, and the company had not contributed a cent to the workers’ pension plan since 1987.
One of the ways GE made money from the pension fund was by selling chunks of it when it spun off a division of the company. For example, Schultz writes that when GE sold an aerospace unit to Martin Marietta in 1993, it transferred 30,000 employees and $1.2 billion in pension assets – $531 million more than was needed to cover the pension liabilities. But all that was included in the sale price, so “GE effectively got to put half a billion dollars from its pension plan into its pocket.”
With case studies involving some of the biggest names in corporate America, Schultz describes the elaborate schemes by which employers have gutted workers’ pension plans and retiree health care to finance downsizings, boost corporate profits and, in many cases, pay for the obscenely generous benefits of top managers and executives.
She describes how some companies have transformed their pensions into “cash-balance plans,” presented as a change that will benefit employees, when in fact cash-balance plans are a way to disguise retroactive pension cuts. A similar scheme called the “pension equity plan” also enables employers to cut workers’ pension benefits; the calculations are so complex that most employees don’t realize they’ve been fleeced until they’re about to retire. These and other innovative ways of robbing workers have been developed by what she calls “a new breed of benefits consultants” that emerged over the past two decades, who specialize in cutting retirement benefits for ordinary employees while boosting executive compensation.
The many complicated and sinister schemes to loot retirement benefits that Schultz describes can be depressing and mind- boggling to follow. She humanizes these stories by introducing us to individual retirees who were the victims of these plots, who struggled for months or years to even grasp what was happening to them. Some of these people fought back, in some cases achieving limited success, but often failing in a system of “benefits law” which the corporations have largely rigged in their own favor.
The book deals with the looting of pensions in the private, corporate sector. But in the final pages she says a few words about the developing crisis of public employee pension plans. The same consultants and financial firms who engineered the pillage of private pensions, she writes, are now playing “a non-starring role in the public pension debacle.” She adds:
“The scapegoat game continues. Corporate employers are still blaming aging workers, rising ‘legacy costs’ and ‘spiraling’ retiree health care costs for their financial woes – not their own actions that squandered billions of dollars in pension assets, their thinly-masked desire to convert benefits earned by and promised to retirees into profits for executives and shareholders, and their willingness to sacrifice retiree plans, and the well being of retirees, for short-term gains.
“In the public plan sector, the scapegoats are the public employees and retirees, who are beginning to have the haunted look of victims of the Salem witch hunts. The real culprits are the self-serving politicians and officials who passed the funding buck to future generations, the consulting firms that helped them do this, and the investment banks that conned local governments into investing taxpayer-funded pensions into risky, abusive investments. ”
What’s the answer? Schultz calls for tightening laws to stop many of the abuses she’s uncovered. “Pension law requires that the plan be managed for the ‘exclusive benefit’ of the participants, ” she writes, but the law “is like a toothless dog.” She wants “laws that make it tougher for companies to terminate their pensions to capture the surplus money,” and tightening of loopholes that enable corporate executives to divert the money in pension and retiree health plans.
While the reforms she proposes would help protect those workers and retirees who still have defined benefit pensions and retiree healthcare, they could not help the millions who have already lost these benefits. Because Schultz’s scope is limited to the past two or three decades, she does not look back to the origins of employer-based pensions, and therefore misses the underlying problem.
Social Security, as originally conceived by members of President Franklin Roosevelt’s Committee on Economic Security in 1934 and ’35, was intended to provide full retirement security as well as “all forms of social insurance” – health insurance, accident insurance, unemployment benefits, maternity benefits, etc. To get the original Social Security Act through Congress in 1935, Roosevelt scaled back these goals (National healthcare was left out of the bill, for example, and agricultural and domestic workers were excluded, which left out half of the African American workforce.) New Dealers planned to broaden the concept and coverage of Social Security in later amendments. But by the late ’30s life insurance companies, which devised and marketed pension plans to employers (then generally covering only high-paid managerial employees) had gained political traction for the idea of “supplementation. ” This was the notion that Social Security should provide only a minimal, subsistence retirement benefit, to be “supplemented” by employer pensions, savings and other income.
After World War II, with the failure of efforts to expand Social Security’s coverage of retirement and healthcare, unions turned, often reluctantly, to bargaining pensions and health insurance with employers. (An excellent history of these developments is Jennifer Klein’s 2003 book, For All These Rights: Business, Labor and the Shaping of America’s Public-Private Welfare State.
The system of employer-based pensions and health insurance “supplementing” Social Security was never complete – even in the boom years of the 1950s and ’60s, huge sections of the working class had no pensions or health coverage. In our time, we’re witnessing the collapse of that system, with healthcare becoming unaffordable even with insurance, and defined-benefit pensions rapidly disappearing. Retirement Heist is a very important indictment of corporate America’s looting of its workers’ retirement funds. It is further evidence that we need to return to the vision of 1935:
Retirement and healthcare are much too important to be entrusted to employers, and must instead be guaranteed by the federal government as human rights.
In November 1999, a group of the nation’s leading pension experts met at the Labor Department in Washington to discuss a $250 billion problem. After eight years of double-digit returns, the pension plans at American corporations had more than a quarter of a trillion dollars in excess assets. Not a shortage of assets. Excess assets. At some companies, the surpluses had reached almost laughable levels: $25 billion at GE; $24 billion at Verizon; $20 billion at AT&T; $7 billion at IBM.
One might expect that such lush asset balances would be something to celebrate. Many employers hadn’t contributed a dime to the plans since the 1980s, yet they still had enough money to cover the pensions of all current and future retirees even if they lived to be 100. With so much money, the plans would cost the companies nothing for years to come. But employers weren’t celebrating. The money was burning a hole in their pockets.
Today the giant surpluses are gone: sold, traded, siphoned, diverted to creditors, used to finance executive pay, parachutes, and pensions. But you’d think the employers had nothing to do with it. Companies blame investment losses for their plight, as well as their aging workforces, union contracts, regulation, and global competition. But their funding problems were largely self-inflicted. Had they not siphoned off the assets, they would have had a cushion that could have withstood even the market crash that troughed in March 2009. Nonetheless, employers continue to lobby for more liberal rules that would enable them to withdraw more of the assets to pay other things. Meanwhile, their solution when funds run low remains the same: Cut pensions.
In 1997, Cigna executives held a number of meetings to discuss their pension plan. At the time, the plan was overfunded, but executives weren’t satisfied and suggested cutting the pensions of 27,000 employees in an effort to boost the earnings they could report on their bottom line. The only problem? How to cut people’s pensions—especially those for long-tenure employees over forty—by 30 percent or more, without anyone noticing?
Cigna was just the latest of hundreds of large companies, including Boeing, Xerox, Georgia-Pacific, and Polaroid, that had already gone through this charade in the 1990s.
These companies had something in common: They all had large aging workforces—with tens of thousands of employees who had been on the job for twenty to thirty years. These workers were entering their peak earning years, and with traditional pensions that are calculated by multiplying years of service by one’s annual salary, their pensions were about to spike. With the leverage of traditional pension formulas, as much as half an employee’s pension could be earned in his final five years. In short, millions of workers were about to step onto the pension escalator. Financially, that wasn’t a problem. Companies, including Cigna, had set aside plenty of money to pay their pensions, so having a large cohort of aging workers didn’t put the companies in peril. ..
The problem, from the employers’ perspective, was that it would be a shame to pay out all that money in pensions when there were so many other useful ways it could be put to use for the benefit of the companies themselves.
Laying people off was one way to keep pension money in the plan. When people leave, their pensions stop growing, and if this happens just when employees’ pensions are poised to spike, all the better. In the 1990s, companies purged hundreds of thousands of middle-aged workers from the payrolls at telephone companies, aerospace and defense contractors, manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, and other industries, reducing future pension outflows by billions of dollars.
Employers couldn’t lay off every middle-aged worker, of course, but there were other ways to slow the pension growth of those who remained. They could cut pensions, but there were certain constraints. Pension law prohibits employers from taking away pensions being paid out to retirees, and employers can’t rescind benefits its employees have locked in up to that point. But they can stop the growth, by freezing the plans, or slow it, by switching to a less generous formula.
That was the route Cigna took. The company estimated that the move would cut benefits of older workers by 40 percent or more, which meant that as much as $80 million that had been earmarked for their pensions would remain in the plan. The challenge was how to cut pensions without provoking an employee uprising. Pushing people off the pension escalator just when they’re about to lock in the fruits of their long tenure would be like telling a traveler that his nearly one million frequent flier miles were being rescinded—they weren’t going to like it.
Cigna’s solution to this communications challenge? Don’t tell employees. In September 1997, consulting firm Mercer signed a $200,000 consulting contract to prepare the written communication to Cigna employees, describing the changes without disclosing the negative effects. One of these was a benefits newsletter Cigna sent employees in November 1997, entitled “Introducing Your New Retirement Program.” On the front, “Message from CEO Bill Taylor” declared: “I am pleased to announce that on January 1, 1998, CIGNA will significantly enhance its retirement program.” “These enhancements will make our retirement program highly competitive.”
The newsletter told employees that “the new plan is designed to work well for both longer- and shorter-service employees,” provides “steadier benefit growth throughout [the employee’s] career,” and “build[s] benefits faster” than the old plan. “One advantage the company will not get from the retirement program changes is cost savings.” In formal pension documents it later distributed, Cigna reiterated that employees “will see growth in [their] total retirement benefits every year.”
The communications campaign was successful: Employees didn’t notice that their pensions were being frozen, and didn’t complain. “We’ve been able to avoid bad press,” noted Gerald Meyn, the vice president of employee benefits, in a memo three months after the pension change. “We have avoided any significant negative reaction from employees.” In the margins next to these statements, the head of Cigna’s human resources department, Donald M. Levinson, scribbled: “Neat!” and “Agree!” and “Better than expected outcome.”
When employees made individual inquiries, Cigna had an express policy of not providing information. “We continue to focus on NOT providing employees before and after samples of the pension plan changes,” an internal memo stresses. When employees called, the HR
staff, working with scripts, deflected them with statements like “Exact 02 comparisons are difficult.”
Cigna wasn’t the only company deceiving employees about their 04 pension cuts, and actuaries who helped implement these changes were concerned, because federal pension law requires employers to notify employees when their benefits are being cut. At an annual actuarial industry conference in New York later that year, the attendees discussed how to handle this dilemma. The recommendation: Pick your words carefully. The law “doesn’t require you to say, ‘We’re significantly lowering your benefit,’” noted Paul Strella, a lawyer with Mercer, which had advised Cigna when it implemented a cash-balance plan earlier that year. “All it says is, ‘Describe the amendment.’ So you describe the amendment.”
Kyle Brown, an actuary at Watson Wyatt, reiterated that point: “Since the [required notice] doesn’t have to include the words that ‘your rate of future-benefit accrual is being reduced,’ you don’t have to say those magic words. You just have to describe what is happening under the plan. . . . I wouldn’t put in those magic words.”
Just to make sure the message had sunk in, in December 1998, Cigna sent employees a fact sheet stating that the objectives for introducing the new pension plan were to:
The letter went on to say that “Cigna has not reduced the overall amount it contributes for retirement benefits by introducing the new Plan, and the new Plan is not designed to save money.”
This was true, literally. Cigna had indeed not reduced the overall amounts it contributed for retirement benefits. It had lowered the benefits for older workers and increased benefits for younger workers (slightly) and for top executives (significantly). Looked at this way, the plan wasn’t designed to save money, just redistribute it.
The communications campaign was successful. Janice Amara, a longtime Cigna employee, didn’t learn that she had not actually been receiving any additional benefits until September 2000, when she ran into Cigna’s chief actuary, Mark Lynch, at a farewell party for two other Cigna employees. “Jan, you would be sick if you knew” how Cigna was calculating her pension, she recalled him telling her. “Frankly, I was sick when I heard this,” Amara said. Under Cigna’s new pension formula, Amara’s pension would effectively be frozen for ten years.

YOUR MAMAS NOTES: A real estate obsessed pal and informant we call Hot Chocolate sometimes slips Your Mama listings for a wide variety of apartments and townhouses in New York City that sometimes turn out to be owned by celebrities, (in)famous Wall Streeters and/or some other of sort of filthy rich and high profile person or persons.
This morning, like many, we awoke with our customary hangover to a simple communique from dear Hot Chocolate who submitted for our perusal the online listing for a petite and notably narrow four-floor townhouse situated on a quintessentially cute, tree-lined street in the almost ludicrously gentrified West Village and recently popped on the market with an asking price of $5,250,000.
A few minutes poking around public property records revealed to Your Mama the super-slender single family dwelling is currently owned by music industry honcho Thomas Hesse who paid film and television actor Andrew McCarthy $3,250,000 for the historic house in July 2005. Mister Hesse, as per and for the record, acquired the twig-thin townhouse with gal pal Gwendolyn Bellmann who may (or may not) be his wedded wife but with whom he co-owns other property—more on that later—and was expected to attend a June 2011 State Dinner at The White House in honor of Germany's Chancellor Dr. Angela Merkel.
Mister McCarthy—one hopes well past his ugly 1999 über-chagrin for his real and/or perceived association with the so-called Brat Pack actors who appeared in varying combinations in scads of zeitgeist-y and iconic mid- to late-1980s movies such as St. Elmo's Fire, Pretty in Pink, Less Than Zero, and Weekend At Bernies—picked up the teeny-weeny West Village townhouse in the late 1980s for an unknown amount of money. (We can't confirm it and we'll outright deny it iffin any of y'all ever quote us about it but all evidence we peeped in the public property records indicates Mister McCarthy paid under a million clams for the property.)
Impressively accomplished and Brussels-born Mister Hesse, for any of y'all who might be curious, was educated at some of the U.K.'s best schools including the London School of Economics, trained as a concert pianist at the Universität Mozarteum Salzberg (Austria), and currently is currently responsible for Sony Music Entertainment's global digital businesses, whatever that means.
Listing information and property records for the slivery abode shows it was originally built in the late 1800s, measures less than 2,000 square feet over 4 floors (not counting the cellar level) and, at a pinchingly slim 12.75+- feet wide, won't likely appeal to widely-wing spanned or over-amply buttocked potential buyers.
Listing information goes on to explain that many of the homes original architectural features remain intact including (but probably not limited to) the dee-voon wide-plank pine floors throughout, the seven wood-burning fireplaces with original mantels, and the glorious, sky-lit nautilus-shaped staircase that corkscrews tightly up through the center of the house.
Floor plans included with listing information (above) show there are three squeezy (and windowless) bathrooms—in all fairness the top floor restroom does have a skylight—and up to 6 bedrooms, depending on how the various rooms are furnished and used.
A tomato red door set atop the slightly elevated stoop opens directly into a L-shaped space that might make for a generous entry/reception room but would most assuredly make for an uncomfortably claustrophobic living and/or dining room. The 10-foot ceilings on the parlor floor help to amp up the volume of the slim but well-equipped kitchen outfitted with high-grade stainless steel appliances, contemporary white cabinetry, slab marble counter tops, and lots of windows plus a back door that connects to the small but still much-desired 250-ish square foot backyard.
One floor down, the garden level also opens directly to the backyard. The floor plan shows two rooms divided by a very compact bathroom outfitted with the townhouse's only bathtub and labeled as bedrooms but are certainly usable for any number of other utilities as the occupant desires.
The second floor has two intimately-scaled rooms also usable as bedrooms—or any number of other ways—and also divided by a hall bathroom hardly larger than a decent-sized coat closet. The floor plan pattern repeats itself on the top floor where an itty-bitty (sky lit) facility that opens into the hall sits between two rooms labeled as bedrooms.
Iffin this were Your Mama and the Dr. Cooter's house—and, of course, it never will be even though we are in the minority of folks who could probably tolerate the ridiculously tiny terliting facilities—we'd occupy the entire top floor as the master suite with the bedroom at the rear and a fitted dressing room at the front. We'd do up both the second floor rooms as a pair of living/lounging/television watching rooms, and stick the "formal" dining room down at the rear of the garden level where we'd connect it to the parlor level kitchen directly above with a small dumbwaiter installed to the right of the fireplace in each of the rooms.
Guests would be installed in the front room of the garden floor where they'd have convenient and separate access to the street and wouldn't need to bother us every time they wanted to sneak out for a candy snack or step out for a Broadway show. Of course, we'd have to bolt and Super Glue that door closed when our hussified b.f.f. Fiona Trambeau came to visit lest we'd have a constant cluster of questionable gentleman standing around on the sidewalk waiting for ol' Fiona to appear in the doorway and give them a lascivious and heavy-lidded nod of her head.
We haven't any idea of the condition of the cellar but the floor plan shows that's where the laundry machines are located so one hopes for five and some million smackers it's not a dank, spiderweb strewn nightmare.
Mister Hesse and Miz Bellmann together also own an historic converted church in bucolic Barrytown, NY originally built in 1875 and at one time owned by famous Fluxus artist Alison Knowles and fellow Fluxus artist/theorist Dick Higgins who—those poppycocking creative types—married each other not once but twice, first in 1960 and than again in 1984. But we digress...
Property records we peeped reveal Mister Hesse and Miz Bellmann dropped $459,000 on the 1.3 acre spread that has additional structures besides the converted church and where, like some of the converted church's previous owners, Mister Hesse and Miz Bellmann plan—so says a random YouTube video page we came across in out research—to host occasional readings and performance pieces on the property.

“Imagine if we didn’t provide unemployment insurance or Social Security to most families who needed these benefits. Imagine if the vast majority of families who applied for food stamps were turned away hungry. And yet this is exactly how we treat most poor families seeking shelter.” — Matthew Desmond, Evicted
The stage for this month’s meeting of the East Falls Social Justice Book Club was set nearly 2 years ago. During professional development sessions in preparation for my first year at St. James School, I was introduced to an excerpt of text from a brand-new book: “Evicted.”
The excerpt told the story of a woman, her two sons, and her landlord. The story was heartbreaking and real, the writing relatable and clear. It was so powerful, in fact, that it still resonated with me when public housing came up in a book club discussion 2 years later.
After years of leaving Evicted on my “to read” list, it shot up to the top with the help of the Book Club community. The New York Times bestseller and Pulitzer Prize winner introduces readers to the everyday tragedy of eviction through the stories and experiences of eight families.
Author Matthew Desmond follows these families from May 2008 to December 2009, immersing himself deeply in relationships with all of them. At first, Evicted is reminiscent of other immersive pieces like “Random Family,” which follows a selection of families in the Bronx during the 1990’s.
Where Desmond sets his work apart is in his research. He is not telling the story of a down-and-out “other half,” he is addressing a serious shortfall in urban policy and society. The book’s structure comes from Desmond’s individual relationships with each person mentioned in it—including the landlords. Each of the interactions described in Evicted comes directly from Desmond’s firsthand experience or recorded conversation.
The stories of these interactions read like a novel, and Desmond has interspersed facts, figures, and histories to ground the reader in the sheer reality of their lives. And although the narrative center of this book is in Milwaukee, where more than 1 in 8 renters experienced a forced move (including formal and informal eviction, landlord foreclosure, and building condemnation) between 2009 and 2011, we are constantly reminded that “this book… tells an American story.”
Desmond’s work has been copiously fact-checked and researched: the book includes 62 pages of detailed endnotes, in-depth explanations of his ethnographic process, and a complete description of his survey methodology through the University of Wisconsin and the MacArthur Foundation. (The MacArthur Foundation awarded Desmond their prestigious Fellowship, or “Genius Grant,” to complete the Milwaukee Area Renters Study, since previous research on eviction was insufficient to address Desmond’s scope.)
Desmond leaves you not only with heart-wrenching stories of impoverished communities, but also provides you with potential policy solutions and remedies for the system that has left so many behind. While reading, expect to feel drawn into each of Desmond’s stories and invested in the experience of each person. Expect, also, to feel surprised, frustrated, and maybe outraged at the broken system of renting and real estate in the city. But do not expect to feel hopeless—you will be inspired by individual resilience and the redemption of community, and perhaps you will even resolve to take action.
Evicted reminds us that while poverty can be dehumanizing and cruel, it is experienced by real people with real stories—people who prevail despite their hardships. It reminds us also that poverty is not an intractable reality, but that it is something that can be traced through the fibers of someone’s life and addressed at a variety of societal levels. As Desmond points out in his concluding chapters and call to action, “those solutions depend on how we answer a single question: do we believe that the right to a decent home is part of what it means to be an American?”

Dominic Inferrera, a baritone soloist, “dazzled with range and expressivity” during a Choral Society of the Hamptons concert on Saturday. Durell Godfrey
The Choral Society of the Hamptons closed its 2017-2018 concert season on Saturday at the Bridgehampton Presbyterian Church with two performances of Carl Orff’s “Carmina Burana,” one of the most popular and widely performed pieces in the choral repertoire. A large and expectant audience attended the 5 p.m. performance, which I attended.
“Carmina Burana” was written in 1937 for chorus, large orchestra, two pianos, boys choir, and a great deal of percussion, and it was intended for performance with dance and visual elements. Its immediate popularity resulted in a reduced version for two pianos and percussion, allowing for performances by choirs with more modest resources, and that version was offered on Sunday.
Much of this variation and contrast in the work is provided by Orff’s use of orchestral color and by sudden juxtaposition of varying masses of choral and orchestral sound. Orchestral color is not available in this arrangement (approved by Orff) but rhythmic energy and dynamic contrast remain intact and opportunities abound for passionate and compelling music making.
The Choral Society singers, three soloists, and a children’s chorus, as well as the pianists and percussion ensemble, under the direction of the society’s music director, Mark Mangini, made the most of them.
These opportunities lie in the text and Orff’s masterful setting of 24 medieval poems bewailing the fickleness of fortune and extolling the pleasures of love, lust, drinking, and other pursuits of young students in the 11th hrough 13th centuries. (In “Catulli Burana,” part of the triptych to which “Carmina” belongs, cautious community choruses have occasionally chosen to omit translations of some of the racier portions of these texts.)
The opening movement, “O Fortuna,” may be the most widely familiar choral music in the repertoire, having been used in movies, commercials, television shows, video games, and figure-skating routines. The piece literally begins with a bang, the tympanist nearly punching a hole in the skin of his drum and the singers entering a beat later with a full-voiced howl at the cruel and inevitable mistreatments dealt by fortune.
The effect of this opening is enhanced by an immediate contrast with a soft but intense elaboration of fortune’s misdeeds, the intensity largely achieved by precise and emphatic articulation of consonants. Mr. Mangini’s careful preparation of the singers was immediately evident here, as it was in the handling of the many changes in meter and tempo that Orff frequently calls for and in the accelerando in “Tempus est Iocundum.”
The chorus was joined by three soloists, all of whom acquitted themselves wonderfully, if very differently. The soprano Chelsea Shephard’s rendering of one of the most song-like numbers was a pleasure, the tenor Alex Guerrero sang the famously high solo of the roasted swan in a wonderful and pure non-falsetto, and the baritone Dominic Inferrera dazzled with range and expressivity.
The full ensemble was joined twice by the well-prepared young singers from Sag Harbor’s Pierson School, and the contrast with the mature voices of the soloists and Choral Society singers was delightful. Their presence had the added benefit of bringing parents, grandparents, and siblings to a performance they may not have attended otherwise. One has to wonder, though, what the families of these talented youngsters, primarily girls, may have thought about the decision to substitute them for the boys choir that sings about virginity making them “frisky.”
The intensity, passion, and confidence of the chorus seemed to increase as it approached the closing numbers so that as fortune’s wheel completed its turn with the reprise of “O Fortuna,” the tricky dissonances of the opening measures were sung with more conviction and more bite than they had been at the opening. The opening may have been more effective in the second performance. The reprise, however, made for an exciting and satisfying close to the concert.
Despite the preparation and passion of the singers, the skill and precision of the pianists, Konstantin Soukhovetski and Matthew Maimone, and the power provided by the five percussionists, the absence of full orchestral accompaniment was frequently felt and occasionally almost fatal. This was especially true in some of the slower movements. The orchestra is often called upon to provide lengthy sustained chords underneath the singers, something a piano is simply unable to do. If it is a matter of resources, the Choral Society deserves the kind of support that would allow it to provide community performances with orchestra when that is what the composer calls for.
The intelligence and creativity of Mr. Mangini’s concert programming has been obvious for some time, but whether coincidental or intentional, the choice of “Carmina Burana” to close the 2017-2018 Choral Society concert season provided a wonderfully creative and subtle counterweight to its performance of the German Requiem to conclude last season.
Using biblical texts, the Requiem offers listeners a classically refined, tender, and sublime expression of solace in the aftermath of life lost. “Carmina Burana” sends a full-throated barbaric “YAWP!” over the roofs of the world, a lusty “Song of Myself” based on poems written seven or eight centuries before Whitman’s and one that celebrates and extols life lived fully (if a bit recklessly) while roundly cursing fortune for whatever troubles are encountered along the way.
The pairing and contrast, a year apart, of “Carmima Burana” with the Requiem, even if it requires that listeners exercise long-term memory, is a wide musical embrace of the varieties of human experience. It is also an understated touch of satisfying brilliance.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, has recently released his autumn 2017 budget statement.
For many people, attention has been drawn towards changes that are likely to affect the housing market, which has become the major talking point of the budget.
Over the last few years, many political commentators have insisted that the housing market is spiraling out of control, with extortionate rent prices, a shortage of social housing, and a lack of affordable housing for first time buyers being the primary concerns.
The latest budget seeks to address some of those issues, particularly with regards to first time buyers, but what will the Treasury’s new housing strategy mean for you?
Arguably the most significant change to emerge from the most recent budget is the abolition of Stamp Duty for all first-time buyers purchasing homes of a value up to £300,000.
There will also be a reduced Stamp Duty charge on homes up to £500,000, with the first £300,000 remaining Stamp Duty free.
The reduced Stamp Duty for homes up to the value of £500,000 is thought to have been introduced to combat the inflated property prices for first time buyers in more expensive areas, such as London and the South East.
The reduction will apply immediately in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. However the Welsh government plans to devolve Stamp Duty in April 2018, so may choose to abolish Stamp Duty altogether by that point.
The Treasury estimates that the policy will cost £3.2 billion over the course of the next five years.
Philip Hammond has asserted that the Stamp Duty changes will have a positive impact on almost all first-time buyers, with 95% expected to see Stamp Duty cut and an estimated 80% to pay none whatsoever.
However, this has been contested by the Office for Budget Responsibility, who claim that is actually existing homeowners who are likely to be the greatest beneficiaries, with housing prices set to rise by 0.3% on average within the next year as a result of Stamp Duty changes.Some have suggested that the changes will only really benefit first-time buyers in Southern England – particularly in the South East – as many homes in the North were already below the Stamp Duty threshold, or at least within the lower brackets.
The average Stamp Duty charge across the North of England is a mere £11.82 and many have pointed to hefty deposit sums as more of a financial worry to first-time buyers than Stamp Duty, suggesting the government would be better off investing their efforts elsewhere in their bid to combat the housing crisis.
The Government have pledged £44 billion in overall support for housing in order to to meet their target of providing 300,000 new homes a year every year up until 2025.
If the target is met, this would represent the largest scale investment in new housing since the 1970s.
£1.1billion is also to be invested in unlocking strategic sites for development and £400million has been pledged to housing estates which are deemed as being in the greatest need of regeneration and maintenance work.
Concerns with delays in developments moving forwards after being granted planning permission are also being addressed. This comes off the back of the news that planning applications have fallen by a third in the third quarter of 2017. Councils are also to be given the power to charge 100% council tax premium on empty properties.

Confluence S 29º W 60º (2ª of day 2/5/2009) is located within a very thick bushes, with leafy vegetation (cactus, shrubs, scrubs, trees of different species and sizes and stony ground).
Approach the zone of the confluence was as difficult as to walk the 800m that separated us from the dirty road where we left our vehicle. First we tried from the south, always by rural ways, until a padlocked gate at little more than 2 km from the confluence, in front of the inaccessible forest. To walk that distance by that “forest” was practically impossible.
Then we had to make a roundup of 40 km to face it by the north. This way also we were at 2 kms, in which there was to cross a seeded field, and later go into in the bushes. The last attempt was by the east; crossing a stream first in sense W-E and later N-S, we entered a private way where we requested permission to walk within the field 800m that separated to us of the confluence.
The forest turned out to be more difficult from which we thought, great part of the passage was necessary to make it “lying down”. To arrive at the indicated point we lost 3 trousers, a camera of photos and we gain several bruises and scratches. After more than one hour, dirty, sweated and tired (already it was 16:00 pm and did 32ºC) we arrived at the S29 W60. To take the photo with the GPS in the exact point was impossible; we came near everything what we could, we took the required photos (the images of the 4 cardinal points, like thus also the one of 100m, are identical) and initiate the return

Property agreements are commonly thought of as “pre-nuptial agreements” between people about to get married who want to protect separate property, or protect an inherited family home, from being later divided by the court as community property, if there should be a divorce.
However, property agreements can be made between spouses after marriage to clarify the status of property in the event of death of one or both spouses, as well as in case of divorce.
Also, these days, someone who has had a rough divorce will say, “I’m never getting married, so I won’t go through that again,” but then, after spending a decade with someone they did not marry, they learn that their “marriage-like” property can be divided just like community property. Even the unmarried need property agreements. Just refusing to get married does not prevent a subsequent battle over the distribution of property accumulated during a committed, intimate, relationship.
Most people should have a property agreement. One person who is adept at drafting a binding property agreement is Spokane family attorney Craig Mason. Arrange an appointment at his office located at West 1707 Broadway in Spokane by calling (509) 443-3681.

The first reason you will want to check out the options for fleet vehicle graphics is because customers will be a lot more impressed when they see such a vehicle. Let us say that you have people delivering items or offering customer service. If they are showing up in plain white vans, it is not that impressive. But if you have a fleet of vehicles that have the same painting and graphics, we believe that you will find that a much better option. We think that will work for you in a very good way.
And even if you are not servicing customers, it is good to have your brand name and logo out there for people to see. Let us say that you have your brand name, logo and some little details on your business on the vehicles. You may even have a phone number or address on there. You may think that is overkill, but think about what happens when someone sees those details on your parked vehicle, or while they are in traffic with you. If they ever need a service like yours, they may note down your name and number for future reference. And that is a big win!
Countless people are needlessly harmed every year by ceilings that fall on them. In New York falling ceilings are a hazard. Falling ceilings are due to negligent maintenance. Certain precautions should be taken to prevent ceiling collapses from occurring and needlessly injury people. Negligence on the parts of landlords, store owners, businesses, and their contractors, unnecessarily exposes people to needless harm – it creates an unsafe environment that puts the lives of all tenants and their guests or workers at risk.
If you or a loved one has been injured by a collapsing ceiling, call one of the experienced, knowledgeable, and hard working Falling Ceiling Accident Lawyers at Sonin & Genis. We are proud that one of our verdicts in a personal injury case was written up as one of the top jury verdicts of the year in the National Law Journal, New York Law Journal, New York Magazine, and ALM Verdictsearch.
Serious injury is always a possibility when a ceiling collapses. If you or a loved one has been injured in a New York ceiling collapse, you need the expert personal injury lawyers at Sonin & Genis in your corner.
When a ceiling falls on you, it can cause death, paralysis, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), spinal injuries, broken bones, fractures, damages to discs, nerves, muscles and tissues in the spine, to joints and their tendons, ligaments, nerves and cartilage – especially vulnerable joints like knees, shoulders, wrists, feet, ankles and elbows. Protruding, bulging or herniated discs can be disabling. Other disabling injuries include: torn rotator cuffs to shoulders, torn meniscus and chondromalacia to knees, carpal tunnel syndrome to wrists, and other injuries.
Trauma to joints can cause or aggravate painful and disabling arthritis and degenerative joint disease. Surgery may help but not cure these injuries. Recovering from these life-altering injuries is not only painful; it requires costly and time-consuming medical treatment, doctor visits and rehabilitation. Costly medical treatment and doctors visits are required to treat these injuries.
Victims are often temporarily or permanently unable to work, or work with difficulty, limitations or restrictions and may have a diminished work life and diminished earnings because of their injuries.
At Sonin & Genis, we will fight tirelessly to ensure you receive full compensation for your injuries and their resultant pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of a New York ceiling collapse. Injuries commonly sustained in ceiling collapse accidents are serious injuries that can require extensive surgery and rehabilitation, lifelong medical treatment, and months or years of lost wages. The costs associated with ceiling collapses make it vital that you receive proper compensation.
Our excellent attorneys specialize in New York construction accident, landlord liability, negligence and personal injury law, and are ready and willing to go the extra mile to win your fight against those responsible for the conditions that led to your injury.
You need a lawyer that understands and knows the medicine, engineering and biomechanics of injury and is able to educate and teach a jury the significance and permanent consequences of these harms and losses, so that a fair jury can provide the helps and fixes that justice requires. You need a lawyer that has the knowledge and ability to successfully cross-examine the stable of defense doctors and litigation experts that the insurance companies routinely rely on to deny liability, causation and damages to deprive injured people their fair compensation.
We have an excellent medical, forensic and engineering reference library. We read and research medical and other journals regularly. Our lawyers have taught Continuing Legal Education Classes and published articles on handling these types of cases and these issues. Our knowledge, hard work and skill have enabled us to win many significant verdicts on behalf of our clients.
When landlords or others choose to violate basic safety rules and standards of care, the following negligent acts and omissions are substantial contributing factors in causing ceilings to collapse and fall, resulting in harms and losses to members of our community:
A contractor choose to violate building codes and good and accepted construction practices and did substandard work, used cheap and inferior materials, had inadequate shoring or placed excess weight on a ceiling
It is long and well established how to safely construct and maintain buildings. When a ceiling collapses in New York, it is the result of negligence. When landlords fail to properly maintain their buildings and unnecessarily harms members of our community, they should be held accountable for the losses they caused. At Sonin & Genis we believe that if someone chooses to put your safety at risk and violate basic safety rules, just to save a few dollars, they should be held responsible for all harms and losses caused by their reckless or greedy choices.
Landlords need to be reminded that a fence at the top of the hill is better than an ambulance at the bottom of it. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
For more than 30 years we have been fighting for the rights of the injured, those unnecessarily harmed by the negligence of others, and taking on the tough cases and emerging victorious, winning multimillion dollar awards for our clients and ultimately making the city safer for everyone.
It’s important to act quickly. If you or a loved one has been injured due to a collapsing ceiling caused by the negligence of a municipality – whether in a building that is owned, operated, managed or funded by the City, such as Housing Preservation & Development [HPD] or a school operated by the Department of Education, a County, a Public Authority, such as the New York City Housing Authority [NYCHA], or in a hospital such as one operated by the New York City Health & Hospitals Corporation [NYCH&HC], at a train or bus station involving the Metropolitan Transportation Authority [MTA], New York City Transit Authority [NYCTA], Manhattan and Bronx Surface Transit Operating Authority [MABSTOA], Metro-North, Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit Authority, Port Authority of NY & NJ, New York Sports Authority (or countless other public entities), the State or Federal government – a Notice of Claim is usually required, a legal document that explains your claim, and must usually be prepared by your attorneys and served on the municipality within 90 days of injury, and sometimes sooner. Some private entities receive federal funds, and a claim must be filed with the federal government. Because wherever possible records must be obtained and reviewed before the Notice of Claim is prepared and filed, time is of the essence and it is vital that you act quickly!
At Sonin & Genis, we know that you have more important things to worry about than getting records and preparing and filing legal documents, so we take of everything so that you can focus on taking care of your family, so call the experienced New York Collapsing and Falling Ceiling lawyers at Sonin & Genis.
There are short Statutes of Limitations within which to commence a lawsuit to protect your rights, so it is important to act quickly!

The APR scale serves as a real-time measure of student-athlete academic progress, retention and timely graduation of all NCAA Division I institutions. All sport programs at OU earned a multi-year (four-year average) APR score above the minimum 930 after the 2011-12 academic year.
The OU women's indoor and outdoor track programs earned a perfect 1,000 multi-year APR, an achievement that puts those programs among the top 10 percent nationally.
In addition, during the 2012-13 academic year OU student-athletes earned a cumulative GPA of over 3.00 in both the fall (3.03) and spring (3.01) semesters for the first time. That average 3.02 cumulative GPA is the highest on record for an academic year for OU Athletics.
“These numbers simply confirm the tremendous commitment that our student-athletes at the University of Oklahoma have made to achieve success in the classroom,” said OU Vice President for Intercollegiate Athletics and Director of Athletics, Joe Castiglione. “Under the leadership of President David L. Boren, the University of Oklahoma has earned a well-deserved national reputation for academic excellence. Our student-athletes, coaches and support staff have worked very hard to uphold that standard.”
During the 2011-12 academic year, the Sooners boasted 10 different programs with a perfect 1,000 annual APR score, tying with Texas with the top total in the Big 12: Women’s indoor and outdoor track, men’s basketball, men’s golf, men’s tennis, women's gymnastics, softball, women’s golf, women's tennis and volleyball all earned a 1,000 annual APR score in 2011-12. The latest report marks the fourth consecutive year that all OU Athletics programs have finished above the NCAA minimum APR threshold.
OU Football once again exceeded the national FBS average, producing a 960 multi-year APR to place the Sooners third among Big 12 institutions behind only Baylor and TCU, who both registered a 962. Men’s basketball registered a 960 multi-year average to also exceed the national average.
The Oklahoma women’s basketball program recorded a 984 multi-year APR in 2011-12, a figure that was only slightly behind the Big 12-best mark of 990 posted by Kansas State. Like football and men’s basketball, the Sooners were well above the national average for Division I women’s basketball programs. Meanwhile, Oklahoma’s baseball squad registered a 958 multi-year APR for 2011-12, a figure that ranked fourth among Big 12 squads.
Earlier this year, a record 151 current and former Sooner student-athletes received their diplomas as members of the Class of 2013. That group featured a department-record three student-athletes finished their undergraduate careers with perfect 4.0 GPAs - football's Gabe Ikard (multidisciplinary studies) as well as Jacy Bennett (supply chain management) and Cassandra Ogan (music-voice) from track & field. Those 151 Oklahoma student-athletes graduated with 36 different majors and will have completed seven different graduate programs, ranging from advertising to supply chain management to adult education and public health.

Quantity surveyors have a range of skills in demand both at home and overseas. They advise on economic feasibility of construction projects and their invaluable expertise is in demand during the whole design and development process. The quantity surveyor manages procurement and advises on legal, contractual and economic matters. Their skills and knowledge equips them well for top managerial posts.
to develop your ability to think analytically and independently about surveying problems and to deal effectively with uncertainty in the pursuit of problem solving.
to enable you to understand the technical, economic, legal and organisational aspects of quantity surveying and the nature of the boundary relationships that exist;
to allow you to appreciate the significance of the built environment to the wider environment and the economy and society as a whole;
to engender your understanding of the ethics and requirements of professional practice in order to ensure you develop a clear sense of professional responsibility and identity;

He was the second but eldest surviving son of Henry IV and Mary de Bohun, and was born in 1387 at Monmouth Castle, being often referred to as Henry of Monmouth.
When his father seized the throne from Richard II, and the young Henry became Prince of Wales, he was only twelve years old, but soon started helping Henry IV in his campaigns against the Welsh insurgents under Owain Glyn Dwr, and later against Henry "Hotspur" Percy and Edmund Mortimer. At the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403, he was badly injured in the face, but refused to leave the field until victory was secured.
There is no reason to suppose that the riotous teenage years of young Prince Hal were any more than a dramatic invention of William Shakespeare, who changed a lot of history in various plays to make a better story.
Towards the end of Henry IV`s life, when he was increasingly subject to a wasting disease that was probably leprosy, there were calls for the charismatic young prince to take over as king, and rumours that he was about to do so by force. But he seems to have had no such intention, and simply became king when his father died in 1413, being crowned at Westminster Abbey.
One of the new king`s first decisions, in a spirit of letting bygones be bygones, was to grant a state funeral to Richard II, the man whom his father had supplanted. He also remained on good terms with Joan of Navarre, his stepmother, even though she had been accused of causing his father`s death by witchcraft.
In the early part of his reign, Henry had to survive plots on his life, one orchestrated by his former friend Sir John Oldcastle, and another involving Lord Scrope and the Earl of Cambridge, both of whom were executed at Southampton.
Henry focussed his intentions on regaining the lands in France which he saw as his rightful possessions. To this end, having failed to win any concessions from the French in negotiations, he invaded in 1415, besieging Harfleur and then winning the extraordinary Battle of Agincourt.
So much had his men fallen victim to dysentery, they removed their lower garments while marching, so that nature could take its course. At the battle itself, the English were outnumbered three to one, but such was the brilliance of the English and Welsh archers, and the foolhardiness of the French commanders, that the battle ended not only in a famous English victory, but with the French losing six thousand men compared to the English four hundred.
Henry returned in 1417, conducting a campaign in Normandy, which fell to him in 1419. With many on the Continent now supporting his claim to the French throne, he married Catherine de Valois, daughter of Charles VI of France, at Troyes Cathedral in 1421, bringing her back to England in a triumphant tour.
In 1422, he returned to fighting in France, but died from dysentery at Bois-de-Vincennes, aged only 34. A short while later, the King of France died, and Henry would almost certainly have been accepted as his successor. He was buried at Westminster Abbey.
Henry was succeeded by his infant son Henry VI, a decent man who was one of the least successful of English kings.
He was universally admired for his braveness in battle, and for his air of confident but fair authority. In an age when many of the nobility still spoke French, he personally used English and encouraged others to do so. However, he had a streak of cruelty towards victims of war, and he seems to have had no sense of humour. However, he might well have become a great king had he not died so young.
Henry and Catherine de Valois had just the one child, Henry VI. After her husband`s death, she formed a relationship with Owain Tudor, and may have married him around 1427. They had children, and one of their descendants became Henry VII.
Catherine died in childbirth at the Abbey of St. Saviour in Bermondsey in 1437, and was buried at Westminster Abbey. Owain Tudor was executed in 1461 at Hereford, and buried there at the Grey Friars.

This Instant Pot Southwest Chicken Power Bowl is hands down my favorite go to lunch. It is the perfect pick me up on those days where I am just dragging. Plus, it is quick and easy to make!
Now I won’t lie. Most days when I make this for lunch I use left over shredded chicken. This way all I have to do is dump everything (except the rice) into the pressure cooker, seal the lid, and press start.
Once the power bowl toppings are done cooking you can quick release the pressure, remove the lid, and stir in your uncooked white rice. Then add the lid back on and pressure cook again for another 12 minutes.
I would not recommend stirring in uncooked rice unless you have been cooking with your pressure cooker for quite some time. And I 100% would not recommend this method if you are planning to use brown rice.
The reason I do not recommend new users to stir uncooked rice into their chicken powerbowl is that you cannot really measure out the liquid to rice ratio. This makes it very easy to eyeball the amount of uncooked rice wrong which could easily result in a burn notice or crunchy rice…
If you do not have leftover shredded chicken just laying around, then no worries you can still easily make this chicken power bowl! It does not take much more time at all to saute a chicken breast!
If you are new to using the saute function on your pressure cooker make sure to give our Saute Tips and Troubleshooting a read before you give it a go.
Meanwhile, cut chicken breasts into bite-sized cubes. Return chicken to pot. Add more water if desired.
The main concern with pharmaceutical drugs is adverse effects, which also apply to nootropics with undefined effects. Long-term safety evidence is typically unavailable for nootropics.[13] Racetams — piracetam and other compounds that are structurally related to piracetam — have few serious adverse effects and low toxicity, but there is little evidence that they enhance cognition in people having no cognitive impairments.[19]
Notice that poor diet is not on the list. They recommend active treatment of hypertension, more childhood education, exercise, maintaining social engagement, reducing smoking, and management of hearing loss, depression, diabetes, and obesity. They do not recommend specific dietary interventions or supplements. They estimate that lifestyle interventions “might have the potential to delay or prevent a third of dementia cases.”
In this large population-based cohort, we saw consistent robust associations between cola consumption and low BMD in women. The consistency of pattern across cola types and after adjustment for potential confounding variables, including calcium intake, supports the likelihood that this is not due to displacement of milk or other healthy beverages in the diet. The major differences between cola and other carbonated beverages are caffeine, phosphoric acid, and cola extract. Although caffeine likely contributes to lower BMD, the result also observed for decaffeinated cola, the lack of difference in total caffeine intake across cola intake groups, and the lack of attenuation after adjustment for caffeine content suggest that caffeine does not explain these results. A deleterious effect of phosphoric acid has been proposed (26). Cola beverages contain phosphoric acid, whereas other carbonated soft drinks (with some exceptions) do not.
Upon examining the photographs, I noticed no difference in eye color, but it seems that my move had changed the ambient lighting in the morning and so there was a clear difference between the two sets of photographs! The before photographs had brighter lighting than the after photographs. Regardless, I decided to run a small survey on QuickSurveys/Toluna to confirm my diagnosis of no-change; the survey was 11 forced-choice pairs of photographs (before-after), with the instructions as follows:
Our #5 pick is BriteSmart which has a long list of ingredients, which look good on the bottle, but when we actually visited each one, we were left wondering about why some of them had been included. We did like the fact that it contained Vinpocetine and Huperzine A. We felt that this was a good product, but missing some key ingredients such as a supportive vitamin blend.
Farah has also been considering the ethical complications resulting from the rise of smart drugs. Don't neuroenhancers confer yet another advantage on the kind of people who already can afford private tutors? Writing last year in the Cavalier Daily, the student newspaper of the University of Virginia, a columnist named Greg Crapanzano argued that neuroenhancers "create an unfair advantage for the users who are willing to break the law in order to gain an edge. These students create work that is dependent on the use of a pill rather than their own work ethic." Of course, it's hard to imagine a university administration that would require students to pee in a cup before entering an exam hall. And even with the aid of a neuroenhancer, you still have to write the essay, conceive the screenplay or finish the grant proposal. Moreover, if you can take credit for work you've done on caffeine or nicotine, then you can take credit for work produced on Provigil.
I had tried 8 randomized days like the Adderall experiment to see whether I was one of the people whom modafinil energizes during the day. (The other way to use it is to skip sleep, which is my preferred use.) I rarely use it during the day since my initial uses did not impress me subjectively. The experiment was not my best - while it was double-blind randomized, the measurements were subjective, and not a good measure of mental functioning like dual n-back (DNB) scores which I could statistically compare from day to day or against my many previous days of dual n-back scores. Between my high expectation of finding the null result, the poor experiment quality, and the minimal effect it had (eliminating an already rare use), the value of this information was very small.

The compound has great nootropic properties that includes memory enhancement and protection against brain aging. There are studies that suggest that the compound is an effective treatment for disorders like vascular dementia, Alzheimer’s, brain stroke, anxiety and depression. However, there are some side effects associated with Alpha GPC, like headache, heartburn, dizziness, skin rashes, insomnia, and confusion.
Oxiracetam is one of the 3 most popular -racetams; less popular than piracetam but seems to be more popular than aniracetam. Prices have come down substantially since the early 2000s, and stand at around 1.2g/$ or roughly 50 cents a dose, which was low enough to experiment with; key question, does it stack with piracetam or is it redundant for me? (Oxiracetam can’t compete on price with my piracetam pile stockpile: the latter is now a sunk cost and hence free.)
Ngo has experimented with piracetam himself (“The first time I tried it, I thought, ‘Wow, this is pretty strong for a supplement.’ I had a little bit of reflux, heartburn, but in general it was a cognitive enhancer. . . . I found it helpful”) and the neurotransmitter DMEA (“You have an idea, it helps you finish the thought. It’s for when people have difficulty finishing that last connection in the brain”).
Interesting. On days ranked 2 (below-average mood/productivity), nicotine seems to have boosted scores; on days ranked 3, nicotine hurts scores; there aren’t enough 4’s to tell, but even ’5 days seem to see a boost from nicotine, which is not predicted by the theory. But I don’t think much of a conclusion can be drawn: not enough data to make out any simple relationship. Some modeling suggests no relationship in this data either (although also no difference in standard deviations, leading me to wonder if I screwed up the data recording - not all of the DNB scores seem to match the input data in the previous analysis). So although the 2 days in the graph are striking, the theory may not be right.
If I assume that the coefficient of +1.22 for as.logical(Magnesium.citrate)TRUE’s effect on MP in the previous analysis represents the true causal effect of 0.156g elemental magnesium without any overdose involved and that magnesium would have a linear increase (up until overdose), then one might argue that optimistically 0.078 would cause an increase of ~0.61. Or one could eyeball the graph and note that the LOESS lines look like at the magnesium peak improved by <+0.5 over the long-run baseline of ~3 Then one could do a power estimate with those 2 estimates.
This product has very nice labeling - very easy to understand and the directions for taking it are immediately at the top of the label in the back. You only have to take or or two tablets a day (preferably with meals) so I 've been taking one a day with my noon meal. I'm a bit surprised that it seems already (after two weeks) that I'm remembering things better (my husband even remarked on it!). Normally, I rely on him for my memory about most things (that, and post-it notes) but I seem to be doing better since taking this supplement. My husband also noticed that I'm in a better mood (more playful and wanting to do things). It has definitely altered my mood - it is winter now where I live and because you don't get as much sunshine and every spare moment is taken up by shoveling, you can get a bit more down in the dumps, which I normally do every year.. It hasn't been like that this year and I feel this supplement has a lot to do with that. Thanks #Vitacern!!!!
Professor David O Kennedy published a book in 2014 called Plants and the Human Brain. In his book he summarizes the last 15 years of research into cognitive nutrition, including the work he's done with colleagues at the Brain Performance Nutrition Research Center at Northumbria University. It's a great read and a good guide to what sorts of herbs and other plants to include in our weekly diet and it is all based on hard science rather than mere assertion or trendy but unsubstantiated beliefs.
I posted a link to the survey on my Google+ account, and inserted the link at the top of all gwern.net pages; 51 people completed all 11 binary choices (most of them coming from North America & Europe), which seems adequate since the 11 questions are all asking the same question, and 561 responses to one question is quite a few. A few different statistical tests seem applicable: a chi-squared test whether there’s a difference between all the answers, a two-sample test on the averages, and most meaningfully, summing up the responses as a single pair of numbers and doing a binomial test:
Nuts and seeds. Nuts and seeds are good sources of vitamin E, says Pratt, explaining that higher levels of vitamin E correspond with less cognitive decline as you get older. Add an ounce a day of walnuts, hazelnuts, Brazil nuts, filberts, almonds, cashews, peanuts, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, flax seed, and unhydrogenated nut butters such as peanut butter, almond butter, and tahini. Raw or roasted doesn't matter, although if you're on a sodium-restricted diet, buy unsalted nuts.
We felt that True Focus offered a good product but the price was slightly high compared to others. Their website doesn’t show a clear money-back guarantee though, which definitely reduced their rating. We found that their customer reviews were mixed and saw that some consumers did not mind paying a little more for a product that is more consumer friendly.
Modafinil is a stimulant specifically designed to reduce fatigue and sleepiness. It was approved for treatment of narcolepsy in 1998, and although the exact mechanism behind its effects is not fully understood, most research indicates that modafinil also works by inhibiting reuptake of dopamine, which produces effects similar to those of methylphenidate. It’s also believed that by inhibiting dopamine uptake, more acetylcholine (another neurotransmitter) is released by the hippocampus, which leads to improved cognitive performance, specifically memory.
Also known as Arcalion or Bisbuthiamine and Enerion, Sulbutiamine is a compound of the Sulphur group and is an analogue to vitamin B1, which is known to pass the blood-brain barrier very easily. Sulbutiamine is found to circulate faster than Thiamine from blood to brain. It is recommended for patients suffering from mental fatigue caused due to emotional and psychological stress. The best part about this compound is that it does not have most of the common side effects linked with a few nootropics.
I’ve spent over a million dollars hacking my own biology. The lion’s share has gone to making my brain produce as much energy as it can. I even wrote a book, Head Strong, about neurofeedback, oxygen deprivation, supplements, deeper sleep, meditation, cold exposure, and about a dozen other brain hacks, and how you can use them to make your brain stronger than you thought possible.

While too much alcohol can certainly destroy healthy brain tissue, drinking in moderation may be good for your mind. A study published earlier this year in the Journal of Biological Chemistry found that the antioxidant EGCG—found in red wine and green tea—helped stop beta-amyloid proteins from harming brain cells in the lab. Additionally, research from UCLA found that wine’s antioxidants may block proteins that build brain-destroying plaques. In other recent news, British researchers discovered that rats improved spatial memory when they consumed what would be the equivalent of a daily glass of champagne; certain antioxidants in the bubbly may encourage growth of and better communication among nerve cells.
It’s 3 p.m., and I am crushing my e-mail inbox. At this time of day, I’m typically struggling to stave off the post-lunch slowdown by downing another cup of coffee or two. But today, message after message is flying off my fingertips effortlessly—work e-mail, personal e-mail, digital errands I’d been meaning to run for months. I’m in the zone, as they say, and for this burst of late afternoon productivity, I might have nootropics to thank.

Brain Food will appeal to anyone looking to improve memory, prevent cognitive decline, eliminate brain fog, lift depression, or just sharpen their edge.
Bacopa Monnieri is probably one of the safest and most effective memory and mood enhancer nootropic available today with the least side-effects. In some humans, a majorly extended use of Bacopa Monnieri can result in nausea. Amongst AlternaScript’s, primary products is Optimind, a nootropic supplement which largely constitutes of Bacopa Monnieri as one of the main ingredients.

The third category was cognitive control - how effectively you can check yourself in circumstances where the most natural response is the wrong one. A classic test is the Stroop Task, in which people are shown the name of a colour (let's say orange) written in a different colour (let's say purple). They're asked to read the word (which is easy, because our habitual response to a word is to read it) or to name the ink colour (which is harder, because our first impulse is to say "orange"). These studies presented a more mixed picture, but overall they showed some benefit "for most normal healthy subjects" - especially for people who had inherently poorer cognitive control.
Your memory may decline with age and high-stress lifestyle. In this post, we cover supplements and nootropics that help improve memory, with the mechanisms.

But notice that most of the cost imbalance is coming from the estimate of the benefit of IQ - if it quadrupled to a defensible $8000, that would be close to the experiment cost! So in a way, what this VoI calculation tells us is that what is most valuable right now is not that iodine might possibly increase IQ, but getting a better grip on how much any IQ intervention is worth.
Racetams, such as piracetam, oxiracetam, and aniracetam, which are often marketed as cognitive enhancers and sold over-the-counter. Racetams are often referred to as nootropics, but this property is not well established.[31] The racetams have poorly understood mechanisms, although piracetam and aniracetam are known to act as positive allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors and appear to modulate cholinergic systems.[32]
So, I have started a randomized experiment; should take 2 months, given the size of the correlation. If that turns out to be successful too, I’ll have to look into methods of blinding - for example, some sort of electronic doohickey which turns on randomly half the time and which records whether it’s on somewhere one can’t see. (Then for the experiment, one hooks up the LED, turns the doohickey on, and applies directly to forehead, checking the next morning to see whether it was really on or off).
One fairly powerful nootropic substance that, appropriately, has fallen out of favor is nicotine. It’s the chemical that gives tobacco products their stimulating kick. It isn’t what makes them so deadly, but it does make smoking very addictive. When Europeans learned about tobacco’s use from indigenous tribes they encountered in the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries, they got hooked on its mood-altering effects right away and even believed it could cure joint pain, epilepsy, and the plague. Recently, researchers have been testing the effects of nicotine that’s been removed from tobacco, and they believe that it might help treat neurological disorders including Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia; it may also improve attention and focus. But, please, don’t start smoking or vaping. Check out these 14 weird brain exercises that make you smarter.
Adaptogens are also known to participate in regulating homeostasis through helping to beneficially regulate the mechanisms of action associated with the HPA-axis (think back to the importance of proper HPA-axis function which you learned about in my last article on breathwork), including cortisol regulation and nitric oxide regulation. Through these mechanisms, they can protect against chronic inflammation, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative cognitive impairment, metabolic disorders, cancer and other aging-related diseases. There are plenty of adaptogens with potent benefits, but the ones you learn about in this article are an excellent start to begin building or expanding your stress-adaptation toolbox.
But what does this all have to do with food? Our gut helps keep our body’s immune responses and inflammation under control. Additionally, gut hormones that enter the brain or are produced in the brain influence cognitive ability, like understanding and processing new information, staying focused on the task at hand and recognizing when we’re full.

This was so unexpected that I wondered if I had somehow accidentally put the magnesium pills into the placebo pill baggie or had swapped values while typing up the data into a spreadsheet, and checked into that. The spreadsheet accorded with the log above, which rules out data entry mistakes; and looking over the log, I discovered that some earlier slip-ups were able to rule out the pill-swap: I had carelessly put in some placebo pills made using rice, in order to get rid of them, and that led to me being unblinded twice before I became irritated enough to pick them all out of the bag of placebos - but how could that happen if I had swapped the groups of pills?
The price is not as good as multivitamins or melatonin. The studies showing effects generally use pretty high dosages, 1-4g daily. I took 4 capsules a day for roughly 4g of omega acids. The jar of 400 is 100 days’ worth, and costs ~$17, or around 17¢ a day. The general health benefits push me over the edge of favoring its indefinite use, but looking to economize. Usually, small amounts of packaged substances are more expensive than bulk unprocessed, so I looked at fish oil fluid products; and unsurprisingly, liquid is more cost-effective than pills (but like with the powders, straight fish oil isn’t very appetizing) in lieu of membership somewhere or some other price-break. I bought 4 bottles (16 fluid ounces each) for $53.31 total (thanks to coupons & sales), and each bottle lasts around a month and a half for perhaps half a year, or ~$100 for a year’s supply. (As it turned out, the 4 bottles lasted from 4 December 2010 to 17 June 2011, or 195 days.) My next batch lasted 19 August 2011-20 February 2012, and cost $58.27. Since I needed to buy empty 00 capsules (for my lithium experiment) and a book (Stanovich 2010, for SIAI work) from Amazon, I bought 4 more bottles of 16fl oz Nature’s Answer (lemon-lime) at $48.44, which I began using 27 February 2012. So call it ~$70 a year.
Microdosing with Iboga: Native to the rainforests in Central Africa, Iboga is an evergreen shrub, with high concentrations found in the root bark. It has a rich history amongst practitioners in the indigenous Bwiti religion in Africa and has recently found its way into Western practices, primarily for extremely effective therapy for drug addictions, but also for physical energy, cognitive performance in smaller microdoses, and a surge in positive emotions (See additional studies here and here.). To microdose with Iboga, you will want to find it in tincture or root bark form (the root bark form is typically encapsulated). If using a tincture, find a source that has the root bark extracted into its purest form, combined with Iboga alkaloids, which keeps the full spectrum of the plant untouched. Just a single drop of an Iboga tincture equates to about 0.5 milligrams and suffices as a microdose. For the root bark of Iboga, a dose of 300-500 milligrams is also an effective dose. I’ve personally found Iboga to be most useful prior to a workout or an effort that combines both brain and body demands, such as tennis or basketball – but it makes you hyperactive and jittery if taken prior to a day of desk work. This makes sense when you consider that African tribes traditionally whipped themselves into a frenzied pre-battle state on Iboga.
I have personally found that with respect to the NOOTROPIC effect(s) of all the RACETAMS, whilst I have experienced improvements in concentration and working capacity / productivity, I have never experienced a noticeable ongoing improvement in memory. COLURACETAM is the only RACETAM that I have taken wherein I noticed an improvement in MEMORY, both with regards to SHORT-TERM and MEDIUM-TERM MEMORY. To put matters into perspective, the memory improvement has been mild, yet still significant; whereas I have experienced no such improvement at all with the other RACETAMS.
The evidence? A 2012 study in Greece found it can boost cognitive function in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a type of disorder marked by forgetfulness and problems with language, judgement, or planning that are more severe than average “senior moments,” but are not serious enough to be diagnosed as dementia. In some people, MCI will progress into dementia.
When you start taking legit nootropics, you get to leave all of that behind you. You may never achieve perfect concentration (most of us never will), but you should find you are able to concentrate on the task at hand for much longer than you do now. You will end up taking fewer breaks, and you might start finishing up your work on time each day again—or even early!
Apkarian and colleagues imaged the brains of 68 participants and gave them personality tests. The researchers then randomly assigned the participants to groups that either received no treatment, sugar pills or a pain-killing drug. Those given pills were not told if they received a placebo or an active drug. Participants took the treatment for two weeks, stopped for one week and then repeated this cycle.

Speaking of addictive substances, some people might have considered cocaine a nootropic (think: the finance industry in Wall Street in the 1980s). The incredible damage this drug can do is clear, but the plant from which it comes has been used to make people feel more energetic and less hungry, and to counteract altitude sickness in Andean South American cultures for 5,000 years, according to an opinion piece that Bolivia’s president, Evo Morales Ayma, wrote for the New York Times.
But how to blind myself? I used my pill maker to make 9 OO pills of piracetam mix, and then 9 OO pills of piracetam mix+the Adderall, then I put them in a baggy. The idea is that I can blind myself as to what pill I am taking that day since at the end of the day, I can just look in the baggy and see whether a placebo or Adderall pill is missing: the big capsules are transparent so I can see whether there is a crushed-up blue Adderall in the end or not. If there are fewer Adderall than placebo, I took an Adderall, and vice-versa. Now, since I am checking at the end of each day, I also need to remove or add the opposite pill to maintain the ratio and make it easy to check the next day; more importantly I need to replace or remove a pill, because otherwise the odds will be skewed and I will know how they are skewed. (Imagine I started with 4 Adderalls and 4 placebos, and then 3 days in a row I draw placebos but I don’t add or remove any pills; the next day, because most of the placebos have been used up, there’s only a small chance I will get a placebo…)
The peculiar tired-sharp feeling was there as usual, and the DNB scores continue to suggest this is not an illusion, as they remain in the same 30-50% band as my normal performance. I did not notice the previous aboulia feeling; instead, around noon, I was filled with a nervous energy and a disturbingly rapid pulse which meditation & deep breathing did little to help with, and which didn’t go away for an hour or so. Fortunately, this was primarily at church, so while I felt irritable, I didn’t actually interact with anyone or snap at them, and was able to keep a lid on it. I have no idea what that was about. I wondered if it might’ve been a serotonin storm since amphetamines are some of the drugs that can trigger storms but the Adderall had been at 10:50 AM the previous day, or >25 hours (the half-lives of the ingredients being around 13 hours). An hour or two previously I had taken my usual caffeine-piracetam pill with my morning tea - could that have interacted with the armodafinil and the residual Adderall? Or was it caffeine+modafinil? Speculation, perhaps. A house-mate was ill for a few hours the previous day, so maybe the truth is as prosaic as me catching whatever he had.
Nootropics are classically defined as something that a) improves brain health, and b) does no harm. So, while many treatments being advertised online and on TV can be classified as nootropics, some of them don’t fit the bill because of the dangerous and damaging side effects they also confer upon the unwary consumer. In fact, most of the results you might get from searching ‘best brain pills’ are similarly not that great, let alone the best.
REPUTATION: We were blown away by the top-notch reputation that Thrive Naturals has in the industry. From the consumers we interviewed, we found that this company has a legion of loyal brand advocates. Their customers frequently told us that they found Thrive Naturals easy to communicate with, and quick to process and deliver their orders. The company has an amazing track record of customer service and prides itself on its Risk Free No Questions Asked 1-Year Money Back Guarantee. As an online advocate for consumer rights, we were happy to see that they have no hidden fees nor ongoing monthly billing programs that many others try to trap consumers into.
Nothing happened until I was falling asleep, when I became distinctly aware that I was falling asleep. I monitored the entire process and remained lucid, with a measure of free will, as I dreamed, and woke up surprisingly refreshed. While I remembered many of my dreams, some of which were quite long, I couldn't recall how my underpants ended up around my ankles.
People charged with doing simple tasks did not exhibit much of an increase in brain function after taking Modafinil, but their performance on complex and difficult tasks after taking the drug was significantly better than those who were given a placebo. This suggests that it may affect “higher cognitive functions—mainly executive functions but also attention and learning,” explains study co-author Ruairidh Battleday.
And when it comes to your brain, it’s full of benefits, too. Coconut oil works as a natural anti-inflammatory, suppressing cells responsible for inflammation. It can help with memory loss as you age and destroy bad bacteria that hangs out in your gut.

Power-wise, the effects of testosterone are generally reported to be strong and unmistakable. Even a short experiment should work. I would want to measure DNB scores & Mnemosyne review averages as usual, to verify no gross mental deficits; the important measures would be physical activity, so either pedometer or miles on treadmill, and general productivity/mood. The former 2 variables should remain the same or increase, and the latter 2 should increase.
The effects of piracetam on healthy volunteers have been studied even less than those of Adderall or modafinil. Most peer-reviewed studies focus on its effects on dementia or on people who have suffered a seizure or a concussion. Many of the studies that look at other neurological effects were performed on rats and mice. Piracetam's mechanisms of action are not understood, though it may increase levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. In 2008 a committee of the British Academy of Medical Sciences noted that many of the clinical trials of piracetam for dementia were methodologically flawed. Another published review of the available studies of the drug concluded that the evidence "does not support the use of piracetam in the treatment of people with dementia or cognitive impairment", but suggested that further investigation might be warranted. I asked Seltzer if he thought he should wait for scientific ratification of piracetam. He laughed. "I don't want to," he said. "Because it's working."
Creatine is a substance that’s produced in the human body. It is initially produced in the kidneys, and the process is completed in the liver. It is then stored in the brain tissues and muscles, to support the energy demands of a human body. Athletes and bodybuilders take creatine supplements for relieving fatigue and increasing the recovery of the muscle tissues that are affected by vigorous physical activities. Apart from helping the tissues to recover faster, creatine also helps in enhancing the mental functions in sleep-deprived adults and it also improves the performance of difficult cognitive tasks.
I tried taking whole pills at 1 and 3 AM. I felt kind of bushed at 9 AM after all the reading, and the 50 minute nap didn’t help much - I was sleep only around 10 minutes and spent most of it thinking or meditation. Just as well the 3D driver is still broken; I doubt the scores would be reasonable. Began to perk up again past 10 AM, then felt more bushed at 1 PM, and so on throughout the day; kind of gave up and began watching & finishing anime (Amagami and Voices of a Distant Star) for the rest of the day with occasional reading breaks (eg. to start James C. Scotts Seeing Like A State, which is as described so far). As expected from the low quality of the day, the recovery sleep was bigger than before: a full 10 hours rather than 9:40; the next day, I slept a normal 8:50, and the following day ~8:20 (woken up early); 10:20 (slept in); 8:44; 8:18 (▁▇▁▁). It will be interesting to see whether my excess sleep remains in the hour range for ’good modafinil nights and two hours for bad modafinil nights.
2 break days later, I took the quarter-pill at 11:22 PM. I had discovered I had for years physically possessed a very long interview not available online, and transcribing that seemed like a good way to use up a few hours. I did some reading, some Mnemosyne, and started it around midnight, finishing around 2:30 AM. There seemed a mental dip around 30 minutes after the armodafinil, but then things really picked up and I made very good progress transcribing the final draft of 9000 words in that period. (In comparison, The Conscience of the Otaking parts 2 & 4 were much easier to read than the tiny font of the RahXephon booklet, took perhaps 3 hours, and totaled only 6500 words. The nicotine is probably also to thank.) By 3:40 AM, my writing seems to be clumsier and my mind fogged. Began DNB at 3:50: 61/53/44. Went to bed at 4:05, fell asleep in 16 minutes, slept for 3:56. Waking up was easier and I felt better, so the extra hour seemed to help.
Long story short, aging is your brain’s worst enemy. The same applies to all organs of our body, but the brain suffers the most. Both neurotransmitters and neurons are taking the blow too. As a result, the neuron communication is affected. Now, this may seem like the rocket science to you, but it’s enough to say, serotonin and dopamine are the most important neurotransmitters. Without these components, you can forget about good mood. Serotonin and dopamine levels drop at a rate of approximately 10% for every decade you add to your age.
The realm of natural nootropics is also accompanied by a family of synthetic nootropics called racetams, most notably piracetam and aniracetam. Piracetam is known to directly enhance learning, memory and attention and, with no observed adverse side effects, can restore cognitive performance in patients who have suffered cranial trauma, inflammation, strokes and ischemic complications following coronary bypass surgery. It can also improve symptoms of delirium and reduce depression and anxiety. In adults, the standard dose of piracetam ranges from 1,200 to 4,800 mg, often broken up into three smaller doses throughout the day. Aniracetam has been shown to concentration-dependently counteract cell death induced by excitotoxicity caused by glutamate, resulting in an overall neuroprotective effect. While you may not be shoveling mouthfuls of glutamate down your hatch or eating cartonsful of MSG-containing Chinese food each night, the same mechanism of action can help protect your brain from excitotoxicity or inflammation caused by other central nervous system irritants, such as toxins, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, rancid oils, etc. Effective doses of aniracetam range from a single 400 mg dose to two doses per day between 500 and 750 mg, taken with meals.
"Instead of messing it up, we should be appreciating something that nature has taken years to optimize," Dr. Lisa mentions. But, we aren't messing it up voluntarily or, at the very least, on any conscious or malicious level. She attributes our disregard for neuro-nutrition to a series of factors, which include the portion size of meals, how parents don't have the time to cook or teach children how to eat healthily, the big influence of cafeteria food, and our "always on the go" culture. According to her, this leads us to unconsciously choose meals which are poor quality and high in sugars, a deathly combination for our brains.
But according to Professor David Weinshenker of Emory University, most people who take Provigil do not report euphoria or even a level of stimulation close to the effects of caffeine. For Weinshenker, the addiction potential of Provigil is limited, and it’s used in various treatment contexts. Provigil may be an effective medication therapy for depression, ADHD, autism and other disorders.
In that year, Dr. Corneliu Giurgea, a Romanian scientist, synthesized piracetam for the first time. Piracetam is classified as a nootropic, although the term nootropic was not used until 1972.[2] Dr. Giurgea coined the term “nootropic” by combining the Greek words for mind (nous) and bend (trepein). Nootropic literally translates into the phrase “mind bender.”
We felt that NeuroFuse was pretty much on par with other similar products. We were happy to see that this supplier offers a money-back guarantee. However, we didn't really like the 14-day trial offer they promote. On the surface it seems good, however, our experience on these matters suggests that if consumers are not happy with the product, cancelling subscriptions can be a nightmare. We much prefer a simple clear money-back guarantee, it's safer for consumers.
"Herbs will have several different compounds in them, as opposed to, let's say, a drug like amphetamine, which is basically one compound, one molecule," Sahelian says. "Herbs will have a set of several or several dozen compounds in them. It's difficult to pinpoint which one of them is the most active or whether it's the combination of many of them that are producing the result."
After 7 days, I ordered a kg of choline bitartrate from Bulk Powders. Choline is standard among piracetam-users because it is pretty universally supported by anecdotes about piracetam headaches, has support in rat/mice experiments28, and also some human-related research. So I figured I couldn’t fairly test piracetam without some regular choline - the eggs might not be enough, might be the wrong kind, etc. It has a quite distinctly fishy smell, but the actual taste is more citrus-y, and it seems to neutralize the piracetam taste in tea (which makes things much easier for me).
Back home, I contacted Aubrey Marcus, whose company Onnit Labs produces Alpha Brain. He attributed my lucid dreaming to increased levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which enhances REM dreaming. Alpha Brain has two ingredients that boost acetylcholine levels: GPC choline, which the body converts to acetylcholine, and Huperzine A, an alkaloid derived from Chinese club moss, also known as Huperzia serrata. "Huperzine A disarms the enzyme that naturally breaks down acetylcholine," Marcus said. "So while the GPC choline is being converted to acetylcholine, the Huperzine A is keeping it from disappearing. It's like plugging the drain and turning on the faucet."
If you want to try a nootropic in supplement form, check the label to weed out products you may be allergic to and vet the company as best you can by scouring its website and research basis, and talking to other customers, Kerl recommends. "Find one that isn't just giving you some temporary mental boost or some quick fix – that’s not what a nootropic is intended to do," Cyr says.
Or in other words, since the standard deviation of my previous self-ratings is 0.75 (see the Weather and my productivity data), a mean rating increase of >0.39 on the self-rating. This is, unfortunately, implying an extreme shift in my self-assessments (for example, 3s are ~50% of the self-ratings and 4s ~25%; to cause an increase of 0.25 while leaving 2s alone in a sample of 23 days, one would have to push 3s down to ~25% and 4s up to ~47%). So in advance, we can see that the weak plausible effects for Noopept are not going to be detected here at our usual statistical levels with just the sample I have (a more plausible experiment might use 178 pairs over a year, detecting down to d>=0.18). But if the sign is right, it might make Noopept worthwhile to investigate further. And the hardest part of this was just making the pills, so it’s not a waste of effort.

Lebowitz says that if you're purchasing supplements to improve your brain power, you're probably wasting your money. "There is nothing you can buy at your local health food store that will improve your thinking skills," Lebowitz says. So that turmeric latte you've been drinking everyday has no additional brain benefits compared to a regular cup of java.
Although piracetam has a history of “relatively few side effects,” it has fallen far short of its initial promise for treating any of the illnesses associated with cognitive decline, according to Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. “We don’t use it at all and never have.”
After a month of testing nootropics, I’m not ready to commit to them permanently. They’re simply too untested, and while “move fast and break things” might be a good approach to building software, it’s not what I want for my brain. Still, I think we’ll likely hear more about nootropics, especially as recreational users of more powerful prescription drugs like Adderall and modafinil look for less harsh alternatives. Sometimes, when you’re working, you don’t want to put your brain on jet fuel—a little unleaded gas will do. And for those moments, nootropics could be a fertile testing ground for the intrepid body-hacker.

Take at 10 AM; seem a bit more active but that could just be the pressure of the holiday season combined with my nice clean desk. I do the chores without too much issue and make progress on other things, but nothing major; I survive going to The Sitter without too much tiredness, so ultimately I decide to give the palm to it being active, but only with 60% confidence. I check the next day, and it was placebo. Oops.
To thwart the rise of non-prescription nootropics, opponents may rally for increased regulation; however, at present, there is insufficient research available to support that non-prescription nootropics pose a danger to public health. Prescription nootropics, such as Ritalin, are already regulated. Further, these drugs have a proven beneficial treatment purpose for intended users.
The methodology would be essentially the same as the vitamin D in the morning experiment: put a multiple of 7 placebos in one container, the same number of actives in another identical container, hide & randomly pick one of them, use container for 7 days then the other for 7 days, look inside them for the label to determine which period was active and which was placebo, refill them, and start again.
She repeats the oft-refuted advice to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day. She claims that drinking water improves cognitive performance. Her citation for that claim is a small study in which participants were instructed to fast overnight and not eat or drink anything after 9 pm, so they were presumably somewhat dehydrated. There is no evidence that people who are not dehydrated benefit from increasing water intake.
One claim was partially verified in passing by Eliezer Yudkowsky (Supplementing potassium (citrate) hasn’t helped me much, but works dramatically for Anna, Kevin, and Vassar…About the same as drinking a cup of coffee - i.e., it works as a perker-upper, somehow. I’m not sure, since it doesn’t do anything for me except possibly mitigate foot cramps.)
The above are all reasons to expect that even if I do excellent single-subject design self-experiments, there will still be the old problem of internal validity versus external validity: an experiment may be wrong or erroneous or unlucky in some way (lack of internal validity) or be right but not matter to anyone else (lack of external validity). For example, alcohol makes me sad & depressed; I could run the perfect blind randomized experiment for hundreds of trials and be extremely sure that alcohol makes me less happy, but would that prove that alcohol makes everyone sad or unhappy? Of course not, and as far as I know, for a lot of people alcohol has the opposite effect. So my hypothetical alcohol experiment might have tremendous internal validity (it does prove that I am sadder after inebriating), and zero external validity (someone who has never tried alcohol learns nothing about whether they will be depressed after imbibing). Keep this in mind if you are minded to take the experiments too seriously.
Oxidative stress refers to a biochemical process that occurs as a result of an accumulative everyday exposure to toxic burdens such as chemicals in cosmetics, furniture, paints, cars, and pollution. Our body has its own way of armouring itself from the damage that exposure to toxins can create through its production of endogenous antioxidants, which is nature’s way of neutralising oxidative stress. Although we have our own production of these wonder molecules, when we are continuously overloaded with toxins in our environment and have problems detoxifying, the liver can become overwhelmed. Research shows that over time oxidative stress can lead to an increase in inflammatory molecules such as cytokines, which have been shown to correlate with depression (5).This is why it is important to have a high intake of nutrients that support the liver in metabolising and removing toxins from the body, as well as regulating the inflammatory response. There are a few things we can change in our diet to support this area, for example eating foods such as the cruciferous family of vegetables which includes kale, cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage. These are particularly effective at supporting the liver in ushering out toxins as they all share an antioxidant compound called indole-3 Carbinol, which plays an important role in liver health (6). In addition, bitter greens such as collard greens, rocket, chicory and swiss chard are also great for supporting the liver’s own antioxidant defence system.
And many people swear by them. Neal Thakkar, for example, is an entrepreneur from Marlboro, New Jersey, who claims nootropics improved his life so profoundly that he can’t imagine living without them. His first breakthrough came about five years ago, when he tried a piracetam/choline combination, or “stack,” and was amazed by his increased verbal fluency. (Piracetam is a cognitive-enhancement drug permitted for sale in the U. S. as a dietary supplement; choline is a natural substance.)
"More and more of our young people are using these drugs to help them work. They've got their laptop, their iPhone, and their Adderall. This rising generation of workers and leaders may have a subtly different style of thinking and working, because they're using these drugs or because they learned to work using these drugs, so that even if you take the drugs away they'll still have a certain approach. I'm a little concerned that we could be raising a generation of very focused accountants."
Took pill 12:11 PM. I am not certain. While I do get some things accomplished (a fair amount of work on the Silk Road article and its submission to places), I also have some difficulty reading through a fiction book (Sum) and I seem kind of twitchy and constantly shifting windows. I am weakly inclined to think this is Adderall (say, 60%). It’s not my normal feeling. Next morning - it was Adderall.
For more in-depth personalised support, some people find nutritional therapy hugely beneficial. To find a suitable therapist, please head to BANT (British Association of Applied Nutrition and Nutritional Therapy) or contact our not-for-profit clinic, the Brain Bio Centre (www.brainbiocentre.com), which offers expertise in nutritional therapy for mental health conditions including depression, on 0208 332 9600 or info@brainbiocentre.com. If you feel you need more immediate help, for whatever it is that you’re going through, theSamaritans helpline offer support 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and can point you in the right direction of getting further help.
Often her language is not that of a scientist. She uses buzzwords like detoxification and boosting the immune system. She avoids GMOs and things that she thinks are unnatural like “manufactured” minerals and salts. She says she takes royal jelly daily for its natural antibiotic effects; she says these effects are “known, but perhaps not scientifically confirmed.” If not scientifically confirmed, how are the effects “known”? She says plants produce phytonutrients to increase their life span, and then she leaps to the conclusion that humans will derive the same benefits from eating the plants.
At this point, I began thinking about what I was doing. Black-market Adderall is fairly expensive; $4-10 a pill vs prescription prices which run more like $60 for 120 20mg pills. It would be a bad idea to become a fan without being quite sure that it is delivering bang for the buck. Now, why the piracetam mix as the placebo as opposed to my other available powder, creatine powder, which has much smaller mental effects? Because the question for me is not whether the Adderall works (I am quite sure that the amphetamines have effects!) but whether it works better for me than my cheap legal standbys (piracetam & caffeine)? (Does Adderall have marginal advantage for me?) Hence, I want to know whether Adderall is better than my piracetam mix. People frequently underestimate the power of placebo effects, so it’s worth testing. (Unfortunately, it seems that there is experimental evidence that people on Adderall know they are on Adderall and also believe they have improved performance, when they do not5. So the blind testing does not buy me as much as it could.)
The BoredAt websites - which allow college students to chat idly while they're ostensibly studying - are filled with messages about Adderall. Posts like these, from the BoredAtPenn site, are typical: "I have some Adderall - I'm sitting by room 101.10 in a grey shirt and headphones"; "I have Adderall for sale 20mg for $15"; "I took Adderall at 8pm, it's 6:30am and I've barely blinked." On the Columbia site one poster complains that her friends take Adderall "like candy", adding: "I don't want to be at a disadvantage to everyone else. Is it really that dangerous? My grades weren't that great this year and I could do with a bump." A Columbia student responds: "It's probably not a good idea if you're not prescribed", but offers practical advice anyway: "Keep the dose normal and don't grind them up or snort them." Occasional dissenters ("I think there should be random drug testing at every exam") are drowned out by testimonials like this one, from the BoredAtHarvard site: "I don't want to be a pusher or start people on something bad, but Adderall is amazing."

Not long ago I met Anjan Chatterjee, a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania, in his office at the labyrinthine Penn hospital complex. Chatterjee's main research interests are in subjects like the neurological basis of spatial understanding, but in the past few years, as he has heard more about students taking cognitive enhancers, he has begun writing about the ethical implications of such behaviour. In 2004 he coined the term "cosmetic neurology" to describe the practice of using drugs developed for recognised medical conditions to strengthen ordinary cognition. Chatterjee worries about cosmetic neurology, but he thinks that it will eventually become as acceptable as cosmetic surgery; in fact with neuroenhancement it's harder to argue that it's frivolous. As he notes in a 2007 paper: "Many sectors of society have winner-take-all conditions in which small advantages produce disproportionate rewards." At school and at work, the usefulness of being "smarter", needing less sleep and learning more quickly is "abundantly clear". In the near future, he predicts, some neurologists will refashion themselves as "quality-of-life consultants" whose role will be "to provide information while abrogating final responsibility for these decisions to patients". The demand is certainly there: from an ageing population that won't put up with memory loss; from overwrought parents bent on giving their children every possible edge; from anxious employees in an efficiency-obsessed, BlackBerry-equipped office culture where work never really ends.
She provides many examples of observational studies where lower intakes of a certain nutrient were correlated with cognitive impairment. Obviously, if someone is deficient in a vitamin or other nutrient, the deficiency should be corrected. But she doesn’t have any evidence from prospective interventional studies showing that, in practice, altering diet significantly improves cognition for people who are deficient, much less in people who are not deficient.
When asked if there’s a discrepancy between Qualia’s claims and that disclaimer, Dr. Stickler points out that products such as OS aren’t promising to treat or cure any diseases. That’s the line these companies can’t cross. They can claim their product makes you smarter or more focused without data from clinical trials, but they can’t claim their pill treats traumatic brain injury, ADHD, or Alzheimer’s.
According to the US Food and Drug Administration, "Piracetam is not a vitamin, mineral, amino acid, herb or other botanical, or dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake. Further, piracetam is not a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of any such dietary ingredient. [...] Accordingly, these products are drugs, under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(C), because they are not foods and they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Moreover, these products are new drugs as defined by section 201(p) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(p), because they are not generally recognized as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in their labeling."[33]
It is incredibly easy to abuse and become addicted to methylphenidate, and misuse is shockingly prevalent, even among so-called “non-affected” users: with students, biohackers, soccer moms and busy executives popping it – and many of the other smart drugs below – like candy. It’s also not all it’s cracked up to be. Side effects include insomnia, stomach ache, headache and anorexia. Overdoses (which may occur easily as it can be difficult to estimate and regulate dosage) can lead to agitation, hallucinations, psychosis, lethargy, seizures, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), dysrhythmia (irregular heart rhythms), hypertension and hyperthermia. Methylphenidate is particularly hazardous to developing brains, especially those of younger students who are frequently prescribed the drug or who – often in high school and college – use it without a prescription. The prefrontal cortex, located behind the forehead, is responsible for cognition, personality-expression and decision-making, and develops well into the mid-20s, at which point it takes over as the “rational” part of the brain. In the central nervous system, and particularly in the prefrontal cortex, dopamine levels must have a natural rise and fall in order for healthy rational processes (executive control) to develop. By influencing dopamine levels, methylphenidate can negatively impact this healthy cognitive development, especially when it is abused or used too frequently.
Effect of Brain Pill on working memory capacity will be accessed by improvement in mean response time and accuracy measured by working memory battery from baseline to end of the study.

-Caviar contains a unique blend of nutrients that are perfect for the brain, including omega-3 fats (a brain-must), choline (a B vitamin needed to make memories), vitamin B6 and B12 (needed to support the nervous system), minerals like iron and magnesium (needed for healthy blood and tissues) and a good amount of protein combined with potent antioxidants like vitamin A, vitamin C, and selenium. [Because] caviar [can be] expensive, fatty fish would be my recommended alternative, especially Alaskan salmon [and] mackerel, bluefish, sardines [and] anchovies [to get the] omega-3’s your brain needs.
Spinach is rich in the antioxidant lutein, which is thought to help protect against cognitive decline, according to researchers from Tufts University. And a longitudinal study at Harvard Medical School found that women who reported eating the most leafy green and cruciferous vegetables had a markedly lower rate of cognitive decline, compared to those who ate the least.
For this batch, I tried out NOW Foods Magnesium Citrate Powder ($7 for 227g); the powder was still a bit sticky but much easier to work with than the Solgar pills, and the 227g made 249 gel capsule pills. The package estimates 119 serving of 315mg elemental magnesium, so a ratio of 0.315g magnesium for 1.9g magnesium citrate, implying that each gel cap pill then contains 0.152g magnesium (\frac{(119\times315)}{249}=150) and since I want a total dose of 0.8g, I need 5 of the gel cap pills a day or 35 per block.
There are many books about nutrition and cognitive functions. The authors ground their nutrition protocol on what humans ate during the paleolithic era. Often these authors contradict each other. For some, we were better hunters than gatherers so we ate mostly meat. For others, we were better gatherers and ate primarily nuts, plants, fruits. Others advance our digestive system can’t tolerate grains because it was a modern invention of the first agricultural revolution (about 10,000 years ago).
Dark chocolate. Let's end with the good stuff. Dark chocolate has powerful antioxidant properties, contains several natural stimulants, including caffeine, which enhance focus and concentration, and stimulates the production of endorphins, which helps improve mood. One-half ounce to 1 ounce a day will provide all the benefits you need, says Kulze. This is one "superfood" where more is not better. "You have to do this one in moderation," says Kulze.
Eugeroics (armodafinil and modafinil) – are classified as "wakefulness promoting" agents; modafinil increased alertness, particularly in sleep deprived individuals, and was noted to facilitate reasoning and problem solving in non-ADHD youth.[23] In a systematic review of small, preliminary studies where the effects of modafinil were examined, when simple psychometric assessments were considered, modafinil intake appeared to enhance executive function.[27] Modafinil does not produce improvements in mood or motivation in sleep deprived or non-sleep deprived individuals.[28]

* broadly interpreted, including ethics, church history, biblical studies, and other areas that intersect with theology
Like a play, Scripture is a text that needs to be rehearsed, says Anna Carter Florence. We can study it carefully. We can listen to sermons and read up on experts. But in the end, Scripture is meant to be encountered—and we do this work best when we do it in community.
In this book Florence offers concrete practical tools for reading and encountering Scripture in groups. She shows how rehears­ing the text together enables us to find our script, or place, in Scripture and better apprehend biblical truth for our lives. Her reading strategies are fresh, easy to grasp, and very adaptable to a variety of contexts.
Suitable for new and seasoned Bible readers alike, Florence’s Rehearsing Scripture invites groups and churches to move beyond doctrinal differences as they gather around a shared text and encounter God anew together.
This book develops an integrated hermeneutic that connects the Bible to spiritual formation and the development of Christian virtues. The author shows how the whole Bible can be understood as a wisdom text that directs its readers morally, shapes them in their deepest affections and convictions, and impacts how they look at the world and live in it.
“In an age of many good books on hermeneutics, Dryden’s A Hermeneutic of Wisdom truly stands out. Rarely have I encountered an author who so deeply understands and integrates epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and biblical studies. With fair critiques of both modernism and postmodernism, Dryden calls Christians to a thoughtful and faithful engagement with Scripture, not as an object but as God’s revealed wisdom aiming at our spiritual formation. Highly recommended!”
China has now emerged as a global leader in the bike-sharing sector, led by local firms that have ramped up their efforts to expand the booming business model to overseas markets, according to a new report.
The report, released by mobile research institution Cheetah Lab on Wednesday, shows that Chinese bike-sharing behemoth Ofo Inc has taken the top spot in the industry globally, reporting the highest weekly active penetration rate. Its arch rival Mobike Technology Co Ltd ranked second.
The weekly active penetration rate measures the number of weekly active users of the app divided by the total number of weekly active users in the whole bike-sharing industry on the Android platform. The report said the weekly active penetration rate surged significantly by 2,440 percent in the overseas market during the last quarter of 2017.
"There is plenty of room for growth in the bike-sharing market, especially the overseas markets. And Chinese companies will become the driving force," said Quan Jing, Cheetah Lab's executive president.
According to the report, the global number of shared bike users increased to 227 million in 2017, and the figured is expected to grow to 306 million by 2019. Cheetah Lab highlighted the huge potential in the overseas markets, estimating the bike-sharing industry would be able to see a spike in overseas users by five to 10 times in the next two years.
Cheetah Lab noted that Asia, including the world's second most populous country India, will become a hotly contested battlefield for various bike-rental companies in the future.
Quan said during a recent meeting for the industry in Beijing that, as competition in the local market is heating up, Chinese companies are increasingly seeking opportunities abroad to create new momentum.
Beijing-based Mobike announced on Wednesday its official launch of bike-rental services on the streets of Chile's capital Santiago, with a plan to gradually set up 100 smart parking spots in the future.
Mobike's orange dockless shared bikes are now crowding sidewalks in more than 200 cities in countries including Singapore, the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia.
Users in overseas markets will be able to scan a quick response code via the downloaded app and pay online using a smartphone to take a ride.
The move came right after Ofo in January this year pedaled its way to South Korea. Currently, Ofo operates more than 10 million bikes in over 250 cities across 21 countries such as Russia, India and Malaysia.
Zhang Xu, a Beijing-based mobility expert, said in an earlier interview with China Daily that bike-sharing firms' overseas expansion will help them to expand their influence in the overseas market, but it will also bring challenges and uncertainties related to local policies and local habits.

The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent you, and believe the gospel. (Mark 1:15)
Repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. (Luke 24:47)
The God of our fathers raised up Yahshua (Jesus), whom you slew and hanged on a tree. Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. (Acts 5:30-31)
When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then has God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life. (Acts 11:18)
Repent you therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. (Acts 3:19)
I listened and heard, but they spoke not aright: no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? Every one turned to his course, as the horse rushes into the battle. Yes, the stork in the heaven knows her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the Lord. (Jeremiah 8:6-7)
And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands all men everywhere to repent: (Acts 17:30)
And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works. (Revelation 2:21-23)
If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. (Jeremiah 18:8)
Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the Lord your God; and the Lord will repent him of the evil that he has pronounced against you. (Jeremiah 26:13)
1 Corinthians 2:14-16, The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, for, “Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ.
We don't anticipate this next month's numbers to move quite as much as the past two, but I am forever reminded that regardless of the numbers, every day is one day closer to our child.
The other week, Ryan took Ava and Kate to church while Olivia stayed home with Mommy to help me clean the house in between showings (we officially surpassed #60 this past weekend).
As we moved around the house, Olivia stayed faithfully by my side, sweeping a bit in each room, and just enjoying the chance to be on her own.
As we were leaving a room, I caught myself thinking, "cleaning seems simple and fun with just one helper. Those were the days . . ."
Then I thought back to that time . . .and how the thought of trying to clean the "whole" house while Ava was awake even then at times seemed like "work."
It was a good reminder to embrace the sweetness of this stage I find myself in with our girls and not just let the parts that can exhaust me take center stage.
Because all too soon, I will be looking wistfully over my shoulder at today and wishing for the simplicity of giggle, hugs and baby dolls.

The world of bobbleheads is pretty fascinating, especially when they start making bobbles of things that don’t even have heads like the Bobble Dr. Who Tardis. It’s a bobble “head” British police booth. W. T. F.? Well it measures 6 3/4″ tall x 2 3/4″ wide x 2 3/4″ long on …

I’m a big believer that even when you’re hosting an elaborate dinner party you don’t have to spend a fortune on flowers. Most of the time the tables are going to be piled high with wine glasses—those glasses serve a very important purpose (wink), but can leave minimal room for flowers.
Often, some simple “satellite” arrangements are all that you need to make the table look beautiful. Recently, I was putting arrangements together for a non-profit event and found some beautiful peonies locally. The result was a gorgeous table, all while staying on budget.
Peonies are currently blooming everywhere in Santa Barbara— from Von’s to Trader Joe’s. My hope is to plant them in my garden one day, but so far I’ve been down on my luck growing them. Luckily, I have access to a pretty amazing floral wholesaler, but these blooms were actually less expensive at Trader Joe’s!
There was only one small problem, these peonies were tightly closed—no lush, open fullness in sight and I needed pretty tables pronto. At the advice of a wise friend (thanks, Kyle), I brought the flowers home, cut off the ends and plunged the stems directly into warm water. Next, I put the buckets of peonies in a hot car to help encourage the process. If you try this, please check on the flowers periodically, as clearly this is not an exact science.
After several hours, I had enough open peonies to get the look I wanted for my arrangements. For most of the tables, I used small vases of several peonies and they looked gorgeous, if I do say so myself!
Flip side: If your flowers are too open, simply put them in cold water or a cool cellar to help them close a little. Either way, make sure you place the flowers in water fortified with flower food.

Amanda over at Soule Mama has a category on her blog called Corners of My Home, which I absolutely love (her whole blog is wonderful).
Since it’s winter and I’m having a hard time coming up with blog topics, I thought I’d do something similar.
This is one of my favorite places in our house, because it’s where my husband sits when he reads to us at night (we’re currently listening to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix). He’s so much fun to listen to – his voices and silly faces keep us all riveted.When we bought the house (2 years ago as of December 2), there was 30 year old carpet throughout the living room and our bedroom. We pulled that all up before moving in, and C. meticulously refinished the original hardwood floors, which turned out beautifully despite being full of staples and covered in water stains. I tiled the entryway not long after.I love this chair, with its rich colour and subtle rose pattern. We bought it used from someone on Craigslist, but it came from Ikea originally. I realize this is a controversial thing to admit (considering they’re a huge multinational corporation), but I like Ikea furniture because their products are free from formaldehyde (a major contributor to indoor air pollution), and brominated flame retardants, and to find furniture without these things elsewhere could potentially cost a fortune. Buying their products second hand is a good option if you don’t want to support them directly.The nice warm glow coming from the lamp is courtesy of my new favorite light bulbs.Where’s your favorite place to read a good book?
Posted in Around the House, Thrifting, Uncategorized	- Tagged Environment/Reducing Our Impact, Uncategorized
Harry Potter—one of my favorites. I am looking forward to re reading them in anticipation of her last book (yeah it’s almost done!).
Nice looking floors by the way—we can totally appreciate the work involved in the re finishing and the tile work that I see in the back. Satisfying though isn’t it?
You’re going to laugh. I have two favorite places to read a good book. One is sitting at my diningroom table, because it’s right next to my woodstove, and there are several windows behind me. I like natural light.
The other … well, I’m a homeschooling, WAHM, and the only privacy I get is when I’m in the bathroom. So, I usually enjoy my books there ;).
Usually on the couch-I can still feel the warmth from the woodstove. Since we have no television anywhere in the house is quiet and peaceful though.
I’m another Harry Potter fan-I’ve read them all and I am patiently awaiting the final one. Is the Canadian version of the last Harry Potter really printed on recycled paper?
Monica – It is very satisfying doing your own renos, although it’s always more work than you anticipate (we had to put in more joists and rebuild the subfloor when we tiled the entryway). I’m always afraid to start something new for fear of what we’ll find!
Burdock Boy – Yes, it’s true! Raincoast has published the last two Potter books on 100% post-consumer paper.

As part of our studies of E4 function we generated a set of mutant viruses carrying point mutations in the E4 genes. The phenotypic characterization of these mutants revealed that lesions affecting individual orfs had no or only moderate effects on lytic virus growth. By contrast, Ad mutants that lack the entire E4 region or fail to express the E4orf6 protein were severely restricted for growth. Unexpectedly, a virus mutant unable to express E4orf3 plus E4orf4 was as defective as the E4-minus and E4orf6 mutant viruses. Further, more detailed genetic and biochemical analyses demonstrated that the E4orf3/E4orf4 double mutant exhibits a pleiotropic phenotype and fails to produce the E4orf3/4 fusion protein, which consists of the N-terminal 33 amino acid residues from orf3 and the C-terminal 28 amino acid residues from orf4. Consistent with this a virus mutant lacking E4orf3/4 and E4orf4 replicated to levels nearly equally reduced to the E4-minus mutant. In sum, these results introduce a function for E4orf3/4 and suggest that E4orf3/4 and E4orf4 provide redundant functions for efficient viral replication, which is intimately linked to their identical C-terminal regions.
Habitat for Humanity has applied to the Portland Bureau of Development Services for adjustment review of plans for a 30-unit multifamily development on North Interstate Avenue.

Plans for a Habitat for Humanity development in McMinnville include some of the most energy-efficient building techniques the nonprofit has used to date. But the strong sustainability angle isn’t enough to win over a group of local residents opposed to the project.
The second phase of a 12-home Habitat for Humanity project in North Portland is nearing completion, and the new homes feature several green building initiatives that are new to the nonprofit’s construction efforts.

No one ever said being your own boss would ever be easy, although you have all the perks of being your own boss, you also have all the responsibilities of it to. As your business grows you will find yourself becoming more and more stretched for time until you can’t manage anymore. When this time comes you will need to get help. People often find that the most time consuming task are the general admin and office task, so it could be wise to get someone like a personal assistant or a home based pa / virtual assistant to do these task for you like call handling, email replies, admin, diary management, bookkeeping etc.
A personal assistant is a secretary that works exclusively for one particular person, handling their phone calls and managing their time diligently. Hiring a personal assistant can be a sensible idea for anyone running a business, however it means you have to consider a lot of things when hiring someone. You have to account for their office space, the computers they will use, salary, pay rises, holidays, employment contracts and adjusting them to the particular job role you need them to step into. This is exactly why virtual PA’s can be beneficial to a growing business. They require no time to recruit, no initial recruitment costs that you are charged for searching for a candidate through employment companies, no full time salaries, and even no office space.
Virtual assistants work from home and offer a business a cost effective solution for these general office tasks. The benefits of a virtual assistant can be vast and the help they can offer your business can be unmatched. Office space is key, and as a growing business you accept that you will have to get a bigger office eventually. However you don’t want to move early, as you might end up having an office that is too big for you and your paying for an bigger office you don’t need – so employing a virtual personal assistant means that your needs for a personal assistant and admin support are covered whilst preserving space for another employee in your office.
The benefits of a virtual assistant don’t stop there. Virtual assistants can also handle your phone call by redirecting all calls through them and they can pass them on to you or can take messages, this way it saves you getting stuck on the phone to people when you should be cracking on with your work. They can also keep on top of all of your office and admin task including diary management, documentation and even research. On top of this they can even arrange meetings and organise your transport.
There are many benefits that adding a personal assistant can have on your team. It all about deciding if you would benefit from having someone working in the office or if you are better off having a home-based personal assistant. If you want to find out more about virtual assistant and the pa services they cover, Smart PA have a lot of information on this topic and can help.
The SEO world is one of complexity and is difficult to understand. At least, that’s what some people in the business will tell you. And only after they have charged you a fortune for updating your meta tags, of course. It does take a time to learn, of course. And it’s also an area of marketing that changes all the time, so you need to keep up to date with new updates. But, whether you want to embrace SEO yourself for your company or hire a firm to do it for you, make sure you are aware of some of the common myths. Here they are.
Unfortunately, having great SEO in place doesn’t necessarily mean you will sell more, get more sign ups, or have more people spending longer on your site. It will get you more traffic, that’s for sure. But it’s what you do with that traffic afterwards that will really make a difference to your bottom line. Look out for high bounce rates to identify areas that need improving. Think about the copy and content you have on display. Make sure your website looks crisp and professional. And always make it easy for a customer to get what they want, sign up, or buy something.
Google is by far and away the most popular search engine. But it isn’t the only one. If you aren’t optimised for Bing and Yahoo! as well, then you are missing out on a tremendous amount of traffic. Make sure your website is optimised for all the major search engines because you just never know: your next big customer may not like using Google.
If any SEO company offers you a short-term solution to your problems, just walk away. It’s a long-term game, and should be treated as such. Any quick leaps to the top of the rankings are very likely to be followed with massive penalties. And only then will you discover that the SEO company you hired has employed some techniques that are frowned on. It can be incredibly difficult to have penalties removed, so always be aware of who you are hiring.
SEO is only expensive if you get ripped off. If you are worried about hiring a company, find a firm that offers a service similar to a no-win, no-fee lawyer. Companies like wmegroup.com.au can help you leap up the search engines before you pay them a bean. Also, the expense of SEO is all relative. If you have a great landing page that encourages people to buy, it could be worth a fortune to you. Yes, it’s a gamble. But with the right tactics in place, you will reduce your risk and increase the chances of your success.
OK, so that’s your lot for now. If there are any popular myths about SEO that you have heard, don’t be afraid to let us know. Leave a comment in the section below and get involved with the conversation! Until next time!

Auckland and Wellington Local Government Reform Bill (Mark Blumsky): This is an expansion on John Key's previous Auckland Local Government Reform Bill, aimed at delivering a "world-class city-wide governance structure" for both cities. It would do this by creating a Local Government Reform Taskforce for each city, aimed at producing a new model for local government which reduces fragmentation and duplication while ensuring effective local democracy. The taskforces would report back by 2010, with each city holding a referendum on its future in the local body elections of that year. The big flaw in the bill is the very tight time window - the report-back date is July 31, while local body elections are held in October, so there's very little time for the resulting reforms to be considered (and no time at all outside of election season). For a change as far reaching as that proposed, I'd expect a little more time so the public can properly deliberate.
Environment (State of the Environment Reporting) Amendment Bill (Nick Smith): This would provide for five-yearly benchmarking by the Ministry for the Environment in the form of a "state of the environment" report, giving a wide overview of New Zealand's environmental problems, what needs to be done about them, and the effectiveness of our responses. It will also provide a compilation of raw data in one place for easy access, and allow long-term trends to be better monitored. It's a good idea, though I'd support annual reporting, just as is done for social indicators.
Infant Feeding Bill (Steve Chadwick): This bill is aimed at protecting a mother's right to breastfeed, by adding breastfeeding alongside childbirth as a prohibited ground of discrimination in the Human Rights Act 1993, and by requiring the Ministry of Labour to develop a code of employment practice covering breastfeeding in the workplace. The bill does not seek to limit a mother's choice in deciding whether to breastfeed.

Businessman Rhett Fuller went to court again today in his long battle against his extradition. Fuller, who handed himself in to police on the twenty-second of August sought bail but was not successful before Justice Adolph Lucas. He will remain at the prison until Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wilfred Elrington, makes a determination on whether or not the Belizean will be handed over to the US Government. His attorney, Eamon Courtenay, is not giving up and says that next week they will make representation to Minister Elrington.
“Well as you heard what happened was that unfortunately Mr. Justice Lucas concluded that he did not have the power to grant bail; I emphasize at this stage. The current position is that having lost in the Privy Council, the next stage in the extradition process is to make a request to the Minister to decide whether or not he is going to surrender Mr. Fuller. That date is next week Wednesday on the seventh of September the Minister is going to receive the representations.”
“I don’t suspect that he will make a decision but he will listen to the representations and anytime thereafter he can make a decision. I mean theoretically he could make a decision right then and there but I would think that he would want to weigh all the evidence that is put before him. Thereafter we hope that the Minister is going to accept the representations that we make and order that Mr. Fuller not be returned to the United States. Essentially what is going to happen is that he turned himself in inorder to ensure that rule of law would prevail and what the Judge was saying to us in short is that the matter is with the executive. If the executive were to decide, if the Minister decides that he’s going to surrender Rhett to the Americans, it is precisely that question, I just spoke to attorney for the learned counsel for the Attorney General’s Ministry indicating that we would like an undertaking from them that if the Minister, in the unlikely event that the Minister were to rule that Rhett be surrendered that we be given sufficient time to come back to court for the court to review that decision. Now we would expect that once the matter is back in the hands of the court we could then make another petition for bail because the reason the judge didn’t give bail just now is because there is nothing pending in court.”
“I’m just really taken aback that they chose to go that route, however the reasons that the judge stated still gives me hope. He stated that it is going; normally the Supreme Court would have the jurisdiction to rule for if the petitioner is going to be appearing once again in another court. So therefore it would be holding him until he appears again, which in this case this is a bit different.”
Fuller has gone all the way to the Privy Council in London but on August ninth, he lost his extradition appeal. His case dates back to 1990 when a US national was murdered in Florida, USA.
You are gone this corrupt gov and pm already got their 30 pieces of silver for you paid for by the American ambassador so pack your bags you are gone.
I believe that Mr Fuller should be extradited, if he is innocent then he will be given the chance to prove it. He is fighting this extradition to the bitter end , why ! ! it make me wonder if he is not guilty of the crime. Sad as it may seem, if it was my family member I would want to see justice. I wish you the best Mr Fuller but go and prove that you are innocent.
If Rhett is guilty of the crime he allegedly committed, then he must man up face the music and have his day in court. If the evidence provided fails to find him guilty, then he should not be here sweating bullets. I am just a layman, not a lawyer but listening to previous interviews with Rhett makes me believe he has something to hide. Not once did he declare his innocence. Not once!
It is strange how a kid commit a crime and expect to get away with it, the long arm of the US will prevail. Elrington should be careful in his decision as this may now cause a domino effect on wannabe law breakers in the US. They will now run home and laugh at the US.
Victor:How many pedophiles from the US have evaded punishment in Belize and flee to the US.Yet no one in Belize request that they be extradited back to Belize to face justice.Where was Mr Elrington when the Lady Ruhah,ma trafficked all those Belizean kids to the US?and why havn’t the said Minister of foreign Affairs requested that she be extradited back to Belize to face justice.Let’s stop the double standard,what is good for the Goose is good for the gander.
Rhett, is fighting a losing battle, as the United States will get him one way or the other. Should the Minister refuse to approve his extradition, it will only be good for as long as this government is in office, and since he is charged with an offense that has no statute of limitation he will be a wanted man until the day he die. He will not be able to go across the boarders as he will be under constant surveilance. Once someone is charged for an offense in the United States only the Prosecuter or a Judge can decide if that person should or should not go to trial, as we saw recently in the case of the former head of the IMF. The most troubling situation in this case, is technically Belize still has the death penalty on the books, so is Florida; so can the Minister get an agreement that he will allow him to be extradited provided he will not face the death penalty should he be found guilty? Of course he will be able to appeal until he exaust all appeal options.

In the wake of the four brutal murders last week, Leader of the Opposition Francis Fonseca offered the cooperation of his Party to fight crime; it was accepted in principle by the Prime Minister. Fonseca has since taken to the streets and is meeting with residents of the most affected communities. Today, News Five spoke to Fonseca about that effort and also about the proposed Commission of Inquiry requested by the Opposition to investigate alleged GSU involvement with the murders.
“No official response from the government with respect of a commission of inquiry. I understand that there are other groups that are preparing to call on the government to do the same thing. So we will have to wait and see. On the second issue, yes, Friday evening I went into the community. We did it without cameras, it was not political; we wanted to meet with the communities. We had an opportunity to meet in one of the yards on Dean Street with about thirty family members and other members of the community. It was very useful, very positive meeting for me. It gave me an opportunity to speak very openly with the members of the community and to hear from them. So it was very useful and I look forward to going back in the community. We have agreed that there will be follow up discussions and follow up meetings and that is what we intend to do. We made it clear that I was not there to play politics; to gain any political points. What we wanted to do and what I wanted to do was to send a very clear message to the people in these communities that in fact their leaders are concerned about them; that we want to hear from them, we want to listen to them; we want to learn how we can better serve them. That was my message to them. I think it’s important for them to know that despite the difficulties they face with crime in their communities; that we are all committed to working with them to rid their communities of crime.”
Information from the Police Department suggests that the investigative team looking into the murders will be releasing some of its findings at the end of the week.
We should consider adopting the institution of the grand jury, a secret body with the power to subpoena witnesses and seize evidence, to investigate major crimes with secret testimony. When a enough secret evidence is uncovered, the grand jury can issue indictments and arrest warrants, which are then tried in court. It is a strong tool to indict international terrorists and cartel members in the States. The commission of inquiry is a weak [and sometimes politicized] institution by comparison.

it nice from him to visit these areas but hopefully don’t use it for political purpose which they as representatives should take it as part of their job to do it without shouting to the world look what I’m doing let the world appraise you later, than you trying to shout it.
Be like the father of the nation Rt G. C. Price (R.I.P) who never use his deeds to gain political name but did it with heart as part of his job he was elected to do.
Months ago the government took control of the International Merchant Marine Registry (IMMARBE) because it claimed that the European Union would have imposed sanctions on fleets carrying the Belize flag of convenience. It placed the registry directly in the Ministry of Finance and introduced a Bill on High Seas Fishing. But last month, the European Commission proceeded to blacklist Belize for not doing enough to meet obligations under international law in the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Tonight, the news is that Spain is the first country to announce that beginning December twenty-first it will reject imports of fishery products from Belize, Cambodia and Guinea Conakry in compliance with the legal measures imposed by the EC. In line with the EC decision, authorities of the Member States are obliged to refuse the import of fishery products into the EU as it is evidenced that the catch certificate has been validated by the authorities of a country with a flag that has been identified as uncooperative. It means that fishery products which carry a catch certificate after December twenty first will be rejected while those with a certificate before December twenty-second will be subjected to all routine checks. In other developments, there is an advisory circulating in the region that in respect of a blacklisting of Belize by the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force member states of the twenty-nine jurisdictions are called upon to consider implementing counter measures to protect their financial systems from the ongoing money laundering and terrorist financing risk emanating from Belize. But Belize and Guyana were cited by the CTAFT for deficiencies in meeting the international standards of fighting money laundering and terrorism.
How did we get here? Didn’t we know this would be the consequence of non-compliance? Forget the morality of it. The big countries call the shots and the pain of punitive measures is real. Who is responsible for this mess? This country has enough technically trained people to avoid embarrassing situations like these. These is an ongoing album of constant embarrassment. Some heads need to roll for this. Oh, they are the same ones hustling passports. Maybe they just have too much on their hands and need to leave the kitchen for good.

LOU WATERS, CNN ANCHOR: Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush is delivering a major address on education.
GOV. GEORGE W. BUSH (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: ... What do you think we ought to teach you to read? And one kid raised his hand and said, well, what do the smart kids read?
Secondly, those of us at the table know that reform comes from the bottom up. And, therefore, we've got a line of authority and responsibility at the local level. It's impossible for the federal government to dictate reform. It's impossible for a centralized authority to say, this is the way it has to be, because, you see, one size doesn't fit all. One size doesn't fit all when it comes to educating the children in America.
You've got different issues, Governor, here in Milwaukee than we may have in inner-city Houston. But there's some commonality. Every child can learn. A good idea in Texas may end up being a good idea in Milwaukee, and vice versa. Tommy led the way on charter schools, which we looked at in the state of Texas, and now we have a charter school movement which says educational entrepreneurship is welcome here. We welcome your thoughts and we welcome your innovations.
We've got one of the great charter school men here in Michael Feinberg. Michael is the guy who runs Kipp Academy in Houston. It's a school full of children who aren't supposed to succeed. They've been labeled by people in our world as "at risk." They ought to be labeled as "full of potential." That's Mike's attitude. I've been to Mike's school. It is a charter school. It is full of love and compassion and concern. And guess what? It's the best middle school in Houston, Texas. Do you know how I know? Because we measure. Because there's accountability. It's that we test in our state and you test in your state, and so the cornerstone of much of the education reform movement has got to be to hold schools accountable.
If every child can learn, we want to know. Accountability systems aren't -- are not -- shouldn't be used to punish anybody. They're needed to correct problems early, before its too late. They're needed to say, we're meeting standards. And if not meeting standards, because we want nobody left behind, there needs to be change.
I know it's the cornerstone, Dr. Fuller of much of your thinking that if -- that in order to provide a challenge to a failed status quo, parents have got to be given choices, that there needs to be outlets for frustration, that if teachers need to -- are frustrated by the status quo there needs to be outlet for their creativity.
And teachers are really important. Teachers are the backbone of how we're going to make sure that our society achieves what we want. Teachers are going to make sure that the reading initiative I laid out, which says every child will be reading in America, every child will succeed -- Gail helped us to develop a very comprehensive strategy that said we want to make sure that when the accountability system starts at the third grade, at least in our state, every child was at the starting line. And so we have K through 2 diagnostic tools that will help us identify early reading problems so we can correct them early, before it's too late.
We've got intensive reading programs, schools within schools. I want the federal government to allow states to access money to take the same reading initiative to make sure all our children are brought up to par before we start holding people accountable.
We can do this in America. The curriculums have to be the right curriculums. The curriculums have to understand the science of reading -- phonics works, by the way. It needs to be an integral part. I went through a headstart program in Eau Claire today. Headstart is a program that we can develop into a comprehensive reading program, so long as the curriculum being used is the curriculum necessary to provide the building blocks necessary to learning.
Teachers are the -- are incredibly important. And that's why I'm going to propose at the federal government level that we spend an additional $400 million more per year to block grant back to states for teacher training and teacher recruitment, to make sure our teachers have got the skills necessary.
Teachers oftentimes lead with their hearts and wonder about their wallets. And our teachers need to be paid better. That's what the governor and I have done in our respective states. But we want our teachers to be trained so they can meet the obligations, their obligations as teachers. We want them to know how to teach the science of reading. In order to make sure there's not this kind of federal -- federal cufflink, the federal structure on programs, there needs to be flexibility at the state level. Tommy can address Wisconsin problems differently than we address Texas problems.
Secondly, I want to expand the troops-for-teacher program. This is a signal that says there are a lot of really good people that should be welcomed into the teacher ranks. Right now, the program is funded at the level of $2.4 million a year. It ought to be $30 million a year. It says that people coming out of the military should be trained and provided a stipend and encouraged to go in the classroom and teach. Senator McCain talked a lot about this in the course of the primaries, and I appreciate him bringing this issue to our collective attention.
Thirdly, there needs to be teacher protection act. Oftentimes, our teachers are sued under federal law for enforcing reasonably disciplinary standards in classrooms. In order to make sure our classrooms are safe, in order to make sure they're zero tolerance, in order to make sure that teachers have got an environment in which they can teach, we need to send a clear signal by passing liability reform that says teachers and principals and school boards can't be sued for reasonable enforcement of laws.
And finally, oftentimes our teachers come out of their pocketbooks to meet -- to meet the supply needs of students. Incredibly enough, our teachers around America are not allowed to deduct that contribution that they contribute money out of their own pay. I believe there's a national average of $400 a teacher to meet the shortage of supplies. And these teachers ought to be allowed to deduct that. I say, not only do we thank you for doing that, not only do we thank you for being a teacher, but you ought to be allowed to get some kind of deduction from the income you make if you make that kind of contribution.
So our vision is that every child will learn. Our vision is to expect the best. Our vision is to understand that to try to pick up the compassion of a charter school here that if it were done at the federal level we would still be locked in subcommittee. We would be trying to figure out the magic formula. See, our vision understands that it's people that make it all happen. And when we unleash the creativity of people and parents and teachers, that this country can achieve anything -- and I mean anything we set our mind to.
And so the goal is every child in America, every single child, will be educated and not one child should be left behind.
WATERS: All right, that's George Bush in Milwaukee, outlining his teacher recruitment program, among other initiatives. There's been some back and forth between the Bush campaign and the Clinton administration's Education Department over these proposals. We'll get into that more with Senator Christopher Dodd, who's been monitoring the Bush speech and will join us shortly to take up the matter of the Republicans' campaign plan for this presidential campaign.
We are first going to hear from some teachers, who are talking about not only politics but what they need in the classrooms to improve education in America.
DIANE DOE, TEACHER: The money gets lost on its way down. LEFEVRE: Teachers consider with special amusement the so-called "education photo-ops." Some are legendary, as Dan Quayle's spelling class.
ANDREA SCHNEIDER, TEACHER: I don't see people stepping into the schools very often to see what we're really doing here.
LEFEVRE: Nearly every urban school district already has some form of literacy program, like this language exercise in Mia Montorosso's (ph) second grade.
LEFEVRE: The teachers say the most persistent problems remain: salaries and supplies -- not enough to live, not enough to do the work.
SAMANTHA GLICKMAN-SYZMANSKI, TEACHER: I was in another school for four years. And by my fourth year, I was the veteran teacher at the school.
SCHNEIDER: I mean, I buy post-its. I can't get post-its, things like that. We have a limit on copies.
GLICKMAN-SYZMANSKI: The TV, the VCR, and then we bought an adapter so, you know, so that we can teach from the computer.
LEFEVRE: Educators say they're used to the flow and ebb of promises. They try to stay focused instead on the youngsters in their charge.
GLICKMAN-SYZMANSKI: To see the glow on the children's faces when they learn something, that's why I do it. I don't do it at all for the paycheck.
WATERS: We are joined now in the Senate gallery by Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, a United States senator, who's been listening to the Bush speech.
I understand that you don't think Mr. Bush is bold enough when it comes to education, that he is, perhaps, behind the times. Is that what you meant to say?
SEN. CHRISTOPHER DODD (D), CONNECTICUT: Well, I just -- first of all, I want welcome him in to the debate. I mean, it's refreshing to hear him at least talk about education and talk about the federal government. For years, of course, Mr. Bush's party wanted to eliminate the Department of Education and, virtually, eliminate any federal role in education. So, I guess I should welcome the fact that he finely decides there is a role for the federal government, so I do that.
WATERS: ... that it's impossible for the federal government to institute education reforms. So, in a sense, he's saying the same thing, isn't he?
DODD: Well, in effect, I was about to make that point in that I don't know if this is just a revenue-sharing program he's talking about. I don't know why they'd go through the charade of sending it here to send it back. Why doesn't he just admit what his predecessors have advocated for, and that's just get the federal government out all together. But obviously, that's not a politically popular position to take. And so, he's not going to embrace that. But in effect, that's what he's suggesting in his proposals. And I think it is worthwhile to note -- now, we welcome him to the debate -- but, if you're going to hire Governor Bush to be the superintendent of your schools, you'd certainly want to know, if he had been to superintendent schools in Texas, how they had done down there. When it comes to SAT scores, which is a national standard, unfortunately, the state of Texas ranks 45th out of 50 states. When it comes to raising your child, states, comparable states, Texas ranks 48th -- and by the way, when he become governor of the state, they ranked 29th -- as a place, a good place to raise your child. So if you're going to hire someone to be the leader in the principle advocate for education policy, you'd want to know what they've done in a previous position. And as governor of the state of Texas, unfortunately, Texas is way behind the rest of the country.
So we welcome this rhetoric, but as Ronald Reagan would say, facts are stubborn things. And when it comes to Governor Bush, the facts of his leadership on education issues in Texas has been very, very poor: flunking grades almost across the board.
WATERS: Let me give you a few facts, Senator, and talk about education goals as set by the nation's governors back in 1989. Their goal number five was by the year 2000, United States students would be the first in the world in mathematics and science achievement. Some states have done better. But as a whole, the nation ranks well below countries such as Singapore, Japan and Germany. What are we to make of that fact?
DODD: Well, it's a good point you're raising because this is no longer a debate about whether or not students can compete with each other in this country. In the 21st century, you are going to have to compete in a global setting. So, when those standards were set, they were very worthwhile and laudable. We haven't achieved them. But frankly, we've gone a long way in the last six or seven years. It was improving dramatically. I noticed that the governor -- they talk about reading, and talking about charter schools. Now, these are warmed-over ideas in the sense that there's nothing bold about them. There was one charter school in 1993; there are now 1,700 in the country. Reading programs, we've past that three years ago; assigned into law three years ago.
I welcome Governor Bush's endorsement of the idea. But to suggest this is something bold, a new initiative, I don't know where he has been, but frankly, that's been the law of the land now for a couple of years.
We need to do a lot better job in recruiting, getting dollars and support back to our local communities, giving them the authority to do what they need to do in our toughest schools in the country. We need not give up on them. We need to have a better accountability. You don't get accountability if you write out a check and send it to the state and say: I hope, by the way, you will spend this money on teacher training and teacher recruitment. Where is the accountability there? You never know where the money gets spent. So we need to be bold, we need to be aggressive, we need to be innovative and creative, we need to work as a partner in this. And nothing I've heard yet from the governor indicates -- and certainly, his record as governor of the state -- when you rank 48 as a state where to raise a child and 45th on SAT scores -- and now, you want to lead the country on education. Frankly, that's a record I would be -- I find very questionable.
WATERS: Let me take you back 10 years ago again. Goal number one for the nation's governors was to get children to school ready to learn. Hardly a bold idea.
WATERS: And yet, and it was ignored at the time. But apparently, a good night's sleep, some good nutrition, and attention to disabilities, and the states who adhered to that goal found their educational standards rise.
DODD: Yes, they do. And I -- it's been a pitiful to watch states who, like Texas, go from 29th to 45th in the space of five years. One of the proposals that Governor -- Vice President Gore has is, of course, that early education program, starting out even earlier. And again, we're having a hard time getting support for it. Up here, the Republicans, who are controlling the budget process, don't support that. After-school programs, here we know all across the country what a difference it makes, if there's a good after-school program, using school buildings during vacations in summer months as 21st-century learn centers, as we called them.
To hear the Republican budget, which the president -- Governor Bush endorses, just cut by $547 million after-school programs, despite President Clinton and Vice President Gore's calling for a billion more dollars to establish 6,000 more of these centers, so that these kids get a chance to learn during the after-school hours, rather than on the streets being victimized or causing the kind of problems or getting into the difficulties, that every police chief will tell you occurs. These are the kinds of ideas we would like the governor to endorse.
We want him to be bold. We want him to be creative. We want him to join with us in these ideas. But yet, they offer no solutions on smaller class size, on improving the quality of our buildings and wiring them, so they are ready to train these children. Seeing to it that we have teachers, that are well-prepared, ready to learn.
In Texas, if you look at the education reports, Texas comes in 47th when it comes on teacher training and teacher innovation.
So again, I respect the governor calling for these things today, but I must tell you, if I was going to hire to be my superintendent of schools and what -- look at the job he did in Texas, I'd be very nervous about him leading the country on education policy.
WATERS: Senator, that's all well and good. But the teachers would tell you, as they told our Greg LeFevre in that report just before you came on, that the most pernicious and persistent problems are the same: salaries and supplies. They don't make enough money; they're using Post-it notes because they don't have enough supplies. They say over and over again that that's the problem. And all these education photo ops are fine and dandy, they say, but come to our schools and see what the real problems are.
DODD: Sure, I know. I have a sister who's taught for 37 years, most of them in a public school system in Connecticut. And that's just what she goes through everyday.
So we've -- the federal government is responsible for about seven cents out of every dollar spent on education. Ninety-three cents in education money comes from the state or local governments to support them. So the federal government has never been a major contributor financially. We can provide some national purpose, nationally leadership, national direction, vision, the kind of boldness we were talking about here. And certainly, states and communities have to decide for themselves whether or not they are going to make those kinds of substantial investments. We can offer the incentives to do so.
I think it's outrageous that my sister has to dip into her own pocket to buy pencils and paper and toilet paper for her schools. And she's had to do that over the years.
Connecticut, however, is doing a lot better today. We've raised teacher salaries to one of the highest levels in the country. And so, as a result of that, less of that kind of action is necessary. So, we are very sympathetic to what these teachers need and what these parents need.
But to suggest to them how you are going to send $400 in a block grant back to the state with no accountability at all, and then argue that somehow that's going to get down to the local level, you ask the teachers and the school boards and the principals and the superintendents, they will tell you: We've tried that block-grant approach in the past, and it failed miserably. Why would we take a bad idea and revive it again, when we know it doesn't work? We don't need old ideas that failed. We need bold, new ideas to make sure that our schools are going to be 21st century ready.
WATERS: It promises to be a long and vibrant debate. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, we thank you so much.

This summer, Unit 4 revealed new fantasies through current global issues. Our field of research was an unexpected 100-metre gap which, according to modern GPS tools, appears to be the actual Greenwich Meridian line. It is a new territory to explore, invent and speculate new worlds. Unit 4 considered this new territory of the Greenwich Meridian as its primary laboratory for ideas and actions.
The Unit was structured as a permanent laboratory for discussions. It envisioned architecture as a way of thinking, where we were both explorers and storytellers. We investigated mechanisms of participation, actions and discussions as major tools to generate spatial and urban processes. The methodology was a constant critical point of view: a continuous debate and discussion where nothing was taken for granted.
Unit 4 explored the idea that in order to design for the future you have to understand the past. From historical research into the city of London, we extracted some urban and architectural concepts. These timeless concepts were translated into 2D drawings that were then built into 3D models exploring these spatial, cultural, political and economical contexts.
While our original intention was to create a new territory to engage the past, present and future of London, the result of the Brexit referendum on 24 June 2016 arose as an idea to create ‘Brexit City’. To manifest this new territory for Brexit citizens, Unit 4 produced a 1:200 model, 50 centimetres in width by 11 metres in length, a new mixing chamber for ALL.

Description: This is the newest revision of our FTDI Basic. We now use a SMD 6-pin header on the bottom, which makes it smaller and more compact. Functionality has remained the same.
This is a basic breakout board for the FTDI FT232RL USB to serial IC. The pinout of this board matches the FTDI cable to work with official Arduino and cloned 5V Arduino boards. It can also be used for general serial applications. The major difference with this board is that it brings out the DTR pin as opposed to the RTS pin of the FTDI cable. The DTR pin allows an Arduino target to auto-reset when a new Sketch is downloaded. This is a really nice feature to have and allows a sketch to be downloaded without having to hit the reset button. This board will auto reset any Arduino board that has the reset pin brought out to a 6-pin connector.
The pins labeled BLK and GRN correspond to the colored wires on the FTDI cable. The black wire on the FTDI cable is GND, green is CTS. Use these BLK and GRN pins to align the FTDI basic board with your Arduino target.
This board has TX and RX LEDs that make it a bit better to use over the FTDI cable. You can actually see serial traffic on the LEDs to verify if the board is working.
This board was designed to decrease the cost of Arduino development and increase ease of use (the auto-reset feature rocks!). Our Arduino Pro boards and LilyPads use this type of connector.
One of the nice features of this board is a jumper on the back of the board that allows the board to be configured to either 3.3V or 5V (both power output and IO level). This board ship default to 5V, but you can cut the default trace and add a solder jumper if you need to switch to 3.3V.

As of today, Ashley and I have been married for 6 months! And we haven't even killed each other yet! So whoever bet on that outcome, pay up. ;) It's kind of a crazy time right now, so we didn't do anything too fancy to celebrate. In the morning, Ashley had to go have blood drawn for some lab tests (she HATES doing that), I had to work and she had school until 6:00 PM, and we're busy getting ready for her next test on Wednesday. She also had a test today, and knocked it out of the park! She's so smart! I love her!
However, we did sneak out to Fuddrucker's for dinner. I've never been a huge burger fan, but Ashley loves it. We've been there a couple times before, and the place is growing on me. I recommend the ribeye steak sandwich.
So, the election is over, and the results are in: the majority of the nation was completely duped into making a completely abominable -- err, Obaminable -- choice. And I'm sure someone will call me a racist for saying so, but I don't care. We're going on record as saying we voted against Obama not because he's black, but because his policies are abominable. They are so bad, we've invented a new word for them: Obaminable!
But what could possibly be so bad about the media's anointed messiah? We'll we'd all know, except that the media hasn't been doing their job in a good long while, so most people know nothing about him. Here's the highlights:
Obama says he'll give a tax cut to 95% of Americans, meaning anyone making less than $250,000. Of course, what he didn't tell you is that taxes are going up on everyone making more than that. And that that also includes small businesses that employ millions of Americans. I can't think of a better solution to an ailing economy, can you? Taxing small businesses? Genius!
Obama has said before that he wants to negotiate with our enemies abroad. I don't know how you negotiate with someone who wants you dead. Say, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, president of Iran, who is pursuing nuclear weapons and has sworn to wipe Israel off the map. How do you negotiate with that? "Okay, what if you only nuke half of Israel?" "90%." "75%?" "Done." And next CNN reports on Obama's version of "I have achieved peace for our time," only to be interrupted by breaking news of bombs falling on Jerusalem. Or New York. Or who knows where else.
Obama wants us to be free from foreign energy, in ten years. Sounds nice - but how do you do it? He's pushing for subsidies for "renewables" more than anything, meaning wind and solar. Anyone who knows anything about the energy industry knows that's ridiculous. Even if building those facilities was completely free, we still couldn't meet our needs with wind and solar. The answer is nuclear, but before we can get those up and running, we need more oil. We can get it from here if we'll just try. It'll take a while, sure, but let's use everything we got. Instead, Obama has admitted he plans on bankrupting the coal industry through carbon cap laws. Wonderful - let's destroy our principle source of energy while chasing a energy castle in the sky.
I could go on - and I probably will. But these are things you didn't hear during the campaign because Obama would never admit it and McCain's campaign didn't have the sense to go after it. We all need to prepare for 4 years of Obaminable policy - as well as drumming up support for good men with sound policies to bring positive change to Washington in 2010, by replacing the ones that have lost touch inside the Beltway, no matter what party they are from. This starts at the local level in your party caucauses, especially if you need to get rid of an incumbent from your own party. The rebuilding of the conservative movement needs to start now, and it needs to start with each of us, from the ground up.
Resource id #4 New Law versus Amendments � North Zone leaders speak up - Volume 7 Issue 3: Disability News and Information Service for India
While the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment stubbornly continues to hold on to the now (in)famous urban legend of �Amendments� to the Disability Act of 1995, the belief and demand of the Indian disability sector for a new, comprehensive disability legislation is fast gaining ground. D.N.I.S. has been continuously carrying the voice of disability sector�s leadership to its readers and beyond. This time around, Dorodi Sharma caught up with a few noted leaders at the North Zone Consultation in New Delhi on January 29 and 30.
D.N.I.S.: Are you in favour of a new Disability Law? If no, then why? If yes, what are your aspirations from the new law?
Javed Ahmad Tak, Honorary Chairman, Humanity Welfare Organisation, Jammu and Kashmir: I wholeheartedly support a new law as it is the need of the hour. Amendments will only be a patchwork process, whereas the new law will cover everyone�s needs.
My vision for the new law is that it should empower all types of disabilities, especially the ones that went unrecognized in the Disability Act of 1995. It should also have strong and efficient implementation mechanisms with proper redressal systems and punitive action if any violation occurs.
Lt. Col. Ravi Bedi, Chief Functionary, Youth Technical Training Society, Chandigarh: The need of the hour is a new and comprehensive law that caters to all disabilities and with strong implementation and appellate authorities.
My aspiration from the new law is that it should truly empower the 10 percent disabled population of the country and enable them to become equal citizens of the country.
P.K. Pincha, Consultant, Disability and Human Rights, New Delhi: I have been consistently voicing my demand for a new law ever since India ratified U.N.C.R.P.D. By ratifying the Convention, India has made a solemn assurance to people with disabilities vis-a-vis their rights. U.N.C.R.P.D. encourages a paradigm shift from the medical and social protection model. Disability Act of 1995 is based on the social or welfare model and will have to be aligned with the Convention which guarantees absolute and non-negotiable rights.
My aspiration from the new law is that it should incorporate the human rights model of disability in its language, spirit and values.
Mohd. Iqbal, President, Peoples� Action Group for Inclusion and Rights, Ladakh: I am in favour of a new law and not amendments. Only a new law will be able to include all kinds of disabilities, ensure active participation of civil society and efficient implementation mechanisms.
I want the new law to empower all disabled people and that it should be implemented and not remain on paper like the Disability Act of 1995.
Virendra Kalra, Indian Association of Muscular Dystrophy, Himachal Pradesh: I definitely support a new law. Amendments will only be a patchwork. It is better to wait a bit longer and get all our rights than a faster, half baked law.
The new law should take care of all kinds of disabilities and impairments. It should be based on U.N.C.R.P.D. and should be strongly implemented.

In early nineteenth century America, movements of moral and religious reform accompanied the democratization of politics and the creation of a national market economy. After a period of growing rationalism in religion, a new wave of revivals beginning about 1800 swept out of the West and effected great change not only in religious life but also in other areas of society. Existing religious groups were further fragmented, and new groups like the Mormons emerged. Women were especially prominent in these developments, becoming a major presence in the churches and discovering in reform movements an outlet for energies that were often stifled in masculinized political and economic life. Among the first areas to benefit from the reform impulse was education. The public elementary school movement gained strength, while a few women made their way into still tradition-bound colleges. Women were also prominent in movements for improved treatment of the mentally ill, peace, temperance, and other causes. By the 1840s some women also began to agitate for their own rights, including suffrage. The movement for women’s rights, closely linked to the antislavery crusade, gained adherents even while it met strong obstacles and vehement opposition. While many reformers worked to improve society as a whole, others created utopian experiments to model their religious and social ideals. Some of these groups promoted radical sexual and economic doctrines, while others appealed to high-minded intellectuals and artists. American culture was still quite weak in theoretical sciences and the fine arts, but a vigorous national literature blossomed after the War of 1812. In New England the literary renaissance was closely linked to the philosophy of transcendentalism promoted by Emerson and others. Many of the great American writers like Walt Whitman reflected the national spirit of utopian optimism, but a few dissenters like Hawthorne and Melville explored the darker side of life and of their own society.

Me: found a "latke casserole" recipe for Hanukkah, and I'll be doing Persian food for Christmas Eve (rice, Fesenjan, pomegranate fish, etc.).
Did our Christmas party already this year. Did turducken, sous vide turkey breast, mashed potato casserole, mac and cheese, butternut squash purée, peas and prosciutto, thanksgiving slaw, balsamic beets, gravy, cranberry sauce, and cheesecake. With a cheese plate that we stalled hungry guests with until dinner was ready.
I’ll be making loads of latkes and there is a small party planned for the 19th, but it’s not at my house.
In seriousness, weve been doing a Friday Night Meatballs dinner (like the Serious Eats article) for the past 10 months now, only we can’t do a weekly dinner, so we do it on the first Friday of every month. So our Christmas dinner was on Dec. 1, and our January one will be Jan. 5th. This is just for friends, and has morphed from meatballs to seasonal theme dinners (because I got bored). The family dinners we will do on the actual dates, but my SIL has 3 small kids (1,5, and 7) and two dogs (a Doberman and a min-pin), so we do those dinners at my MIL’s house where the house is kid and dog friendly and there are enough toys to go round.
It's only crispy on top, really. It's actually a Polish recipe for a "potato marjoram cake", but when I put it together I realized it was basically a Latke Loaf. And it has the advantage of NOT spattering oil all over the stove.
Also, Chris has announced that our January dinner will be the dinner of reckoning, so apparently I’m committed to cooking light. I’m open to suggestions if anyone has any.
Christmas dinner at our Italian club and it`s catered (there`s anywhere from 60 to 90 of us) but we all bring our own alcohol and bring sweets to share. I have to go with Pennie's caramels and Marilyn's toffee if I want to be able to enter the door.
Christmas Eve we host an open house. I`m doing calamari for those who are there when I`m making it (never lasts long), pizzas/flatbreads, maybe a butternut squash curry soup, assorted cheese and crackers and cookies.
So this is a recipe from Polska, which called "melt in your mouth potato pie" but getting that texture requires fine-grating 3 lbs of potatoes, and I don't have a tool for that, so they were coarsely grated, making it come out as "latke loaf", which is what you get below. Also I took the bacon out of the original recipe, hence the dried tomatoes and smoke salt.
Heat the oil in a pan and fry the onion until softened, 4-5 minutes. Add the garlic, smoke salt, and sun-dried tomatoes (if using), and fry for 2-3 minutes more. Remove from heat and let cool for 10 minutes. Mix in with the grated potato.
Add in the eggs, flour, and cream, and mix completely. Then add the salt, pepper and marjoram and mix completely.
Press mixture into an 8" x 12" baking pan (or 9x13 if you don't have one). Bake at 350F for 45 minutes to one hour, or until the top is golden brown. Cut into squares and serve.
Note: I tried this according to the original recipe, which had me separate the eggs, beat the whites to soft peaks, and stir this into the potatoes presumably as leavening. I think this step made no difference at all, and don't plan to do it again, but you can if you like.

USDA loans are mortgage loans which are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The program is officially known as the USDA Rural Development Guaranteed Housing Loan Program, or the “Section 502 loan”, named for its place in the USDA charter.
USDA loans are also known as “Rural Housing Loans”, which can be a bit of a misnomer. USDA loans can be used be used in rural areas, but many suburban areas remain eligible as well for the program as well.
USDA loans are popular among today’s home buyers because the USDA program offers no-money-down financing.
Home buyers can finance 100% of a home’s purchase price; and, can even use the loan to help purchase a manufactured home or a modular home.
Furthermore, because USDA loans are guaranteed against loss by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, they are of very little risk to banks which make them. Low risk brings low rates and this is why USDA mortgage rates today are often the lowest of all of the government-backed mortgages.
USDA mortgage rates are typically lower than the rates for FHA loans, VA loans, and conventional mortgages via Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The annual USDA mortgage insurance premium — at just four-tenths of one percent per year — is 70% lower than the MIP charged for a comparable FHA-backed loan.
USDA loans can be big money-savers; and they’re available to first-time home buyers as well as repeat home buyers. Homeownership counseling is not required to use the USDA home loan program.
The USDA mortgage is backed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and partially funded by the borrowers which use the program. Via mortgage insurance premiums charged to program homeowners, the government is able to keep the Rural Housing Loan program affordable.
The USDA last changed its mortgage insurance rates in October 2012. Those rates remain in effect today, February 13, 2015.
As a real-life example of how USDA mortgage insurance works, let’s say that a home buyer in Cary, North Carolina is borrowing $200,000 to buy a home with no money down. The buyer’s mortgage insurance costs will include a $4,000 upfront mortgage insurance premium, which is added to the loan size of $200,000; plus a monthly $66.66 payment for mortgage insurance.
Note that the USDA upfront mortgage insurance is not required to be paid as cash. It can be added to your loan balance for you to reduce your funds required at closing.

Today in the Top 10 Changes to the A201, we are discussing Termination for Convenience provisions. (Yesterday’s post discussing contract changes dealing with commencement & completion is here). The Termination for Convenience provision (14.4.3) has an interesting history which explains why this small, but very specific, change was made.
Termination for Convenience, an exclusive owner right, was added in the AIA contracts in 1997. However, contractors and architects were losing the benefit of their bargains, including the fixed overhead and the fee or profit on the portion of Work which was terminated.
To alleviate that problem, in 2007, the contracts were revised to allow the contractor/architect to get payment for work executed, costs of termination, and reasonable overhead and profit on the work not executed.
As many of you know too well, Owners, in response, often completely struck through that provision, denying any overhead or profit for work not yet performed after a termination for convenience.
In the 2017 revision, the A201 (as well as the related Owner-Architect agreements), the automatic entitlement is eliminated, in favor of a fill point to prompt the parties to discuss a fair fee before the project begins.
A negotiated amount also serves to liquidate the Owner’s liability to the Contractor (lost business opportunity and overhead and profit on the Contractor’s unperformed work). However, the fee is not necessarily designed to completely liquidate the Owner’s liability to the Contractor’s downstream parties.
To protect the Owner from downstream claims, the A401 will need to be edited and coordinated, so that the Owner’s entire liability to the Contractor, inclusive of subcontractors and suppliers, is established in the Termination fill point.
Likewise, if you utilize subconsultants in your architecture or engineering practice, be sure that your contracts are likewise modified to track your entitlement for termination expenses.
Today, dates of commencement & completion. Technically, I’m cheating today, because these changes are in the related contracts, not the A201 itself, although A201 Section 8 discusses commencement & completion dates in general. However, in the related contract documents (A101 Section 3; A102 Section 4; A103 Section 4), changes were made to encourage specificity.
There is now a check box that allows the parties to select as the Date of Commencement as one of the following:
If no box is checked, the default is the date of the Agreement. The check box format is meant to clarify any confusion between the parties before the contract is inked.
For Substantial Completion, there is also a new check box to indicate whether such is obtained no later than a specified calendar date or within a certain number of days from commencement. There is also a new section that addresses Substantial Completion of certain phases of the Work prior to full Completion.
Today, we are half-way through our series on the Top 10 Changes to the AIA A201. (Here is yesterday’s post discussing financial notifications, Change #6, Part B]
Liquidated Damages can make or break a project. They can either encourage efficient construction completion, or completely derail a project if there are multiple competing delays and delay claims. They can also cost a contractor a lot of money if he doesn’t meet the timing requirements of the Project.
In the 2017 contract revision, a specific fill point has been included in all Owner-Contractor agreements (except A105) to prompt the parties to consider including a liquidated damages provision.
The details concerning calculation of the damages, and the limits (if any) to the damages are still left to the parties to negotiate. The intent of the fill point is to bring the discussion to the forefront, rather than have the provision buried within the Contractor Time section of the contract.
Yesterday, we discussed Change #6, Notice Provisions, in the A201 Contract. As promised, here is one more Notice Provision that has changed– that relating to Financial Arrangements of the Owner.
Since 1976, the AIA Contract Documents have allowed the Contractor to require the Owner to provide evidence that the Owner has made financial arrangements to fulfill the Owner’s obligations under the Contract. That is, the Contractor had the unfettered right to request evidence indiscriminately throughout the Project. The Contractor also had the unilateral right to stop work if the Owner failed to provide evidence that he was financially sound when requested. This process could lead to abuse where, for example, a contractor demanded financial evidence as a ploy to get more time and avoid liquidated damages.
In the last contract revision, in 2007, the documents were changed to only allow the Contractor the right to request evidence of adequate financing prior to the start of Construction, and thereafter only if certain conditions were met. In the 2017 version, revisions were made for clarification, to establish deadlines for receipt of the information, and to restrict the right to stop work relating to a change in the Work.
Now, the Contractor can request financial information before construction (Section 2.2.1) and during construction (Section 2.2.2) ONLY IF (1) the Owner doesn’t make a payment when due; (2) the Contractor demonstrates a “reasonable concern” regarding the Owner’s ability to make payment when due; or (3) there is a change in the work that materially changes the Contract Sum.
If the request is made prior to start of Work, the Contractor has no duty to commence work until the evidence is provided. If the request is made during construction, the Owner has 14 days to provide the information or the Contractor can stop the Work or, if the request is because of a change in Work, stop work on that portion of the Work affected by the change. Of course, the Contract Time would need to be extended if the Work is delayed, and the Contract Sum would need to be increased by the amount of the Contractor’s reasonable costs of shutdown, and re-mobilization.
Since Architects are often asked to rule on whether or not a Shut Down is proper, the changes to this provision are important to keep in mind as you administer your construction contracts.
Today’s Contract Change is an important one having to do with Notice provisions in the AIA A201. [For yesterday’s post discussing Change #7, click here].
Recognizing that we live and work in the electronic age, the A201 now allows written notice to be given electronically.
Written notices can be sent in person, by mail, by courier, or by electronic transmission. (Section 1.6.1). The default for establishing requirements for the giving of Notice (EXCEPT Notice of Claims, discussed below) is the use of AIA Document E203-2013, the Building Information Modeling and Digital Data Exhibit. Alternatively, the parties can use a fill point in Article 12, special terms and conditions.
When establishing an Electronic notification procedure, you should make sure that there is a system in place to capture emails sent to departing employees or others that might otherwise go into the “electronic void”.
Notices of Claims (under Article 15) cannot be by electronic methods. Instead, they need to be made by certified or registered mail, or by a courier that provides proof of delivery. This makes sense, since Claims notices are the most important notices and can effect substantial rights, so proof of delivery is required.
There is one more Notice provision with changes, dealing with Financial Arrangements by the Owner. Rather than write a book here, we’ll discuss those tomorrow, in Change #6, part B. Stay tuned.

She pointed out that in most cases the disability laws provide for access to education or school life and not access to curriculum, which doesn�t mean an inclusive set up. She stressed on the need for A.A.C. training to all.
Pradeep Kumar, Assistant Disability Commissioner, of Karnataka, spoke next. He pointed out that filing Public Interest Litigations under Article 14 is a better way if executives don�t respond to the needs of disabled people.
A parallel post lunch workshop on A.A.C. design was also conducted in which challenges faced by two A.A.C. users in communication were presented to the participants of the workshop. Then the participants were facilitated to form into five groups and select a design focus.

Women�s University, Mumbai spoke on the effect of A.A.C. training on language development of children with mental retardation. She shared experiences from her research. She concluded that A.A.C. is very effective in enhancing language skills in children with mental retardation.
Dr. Tony Booth of I.S.A.A.C. chaired a panel discussion on A.A.C. in so-called regular schools. He stressed that we connect our care to our action, as any action done without care will not be effective.
Anuradha Naidu chaired the post lunch session on A.A.C. and Inclusion. Swati Lahiri, Coordinator, I.C.T. (Information Community Technology) and Ms. Madhuri Kapur, Electronic Data Manager and an A.A.C. user highlighted using assistive technology for continuing education & vocational training. They felt that educational boards and Universities should provide more I.C.T. facilities. Madhuri shared her experience of giving lectures to her students using her A.A.C. devices.
R. Sundaresan, a speech pathologist spoke on Sight word reading as a facilitator in Language development. He said reading could be a multidimensional approach in language therapy.

Dr. Orit Hetzroni, Head of Special Education Program, University of Haifa, Israel spoke in detail on Assistive Technology & Autism at the Plenary. She said every one could use assistive technology. The low-tech solutions can still be very effective. She said there is a gap between research into Assistive technology and its use. She classified it into two categories: Technology needed only during learning and not otherwise. The other is compensation support prosthesis which is needed always like crutches to her. Then she spoke on Autism. Autistics functioned best in a controlled environment. Repetition, organised controlled procedures, multi-sensory stimuli � mostly visual, object oriented presentation, familiar environment, retrieval techniques and practice can give better results. She also gave examples of how computers matched all these criteria.
The next session was on A.A.C. and Technology, chaired by Arun Mehta. There was a presentation on A.A.C. Technology by Media Labs. Kalpana Rao pointed out the leaps in the existing communication technology. She expressed her dream that technology should make every A.A.C. user independent.

Resource id #4 Amendment or New Law? National Consultation to take the debate further - Volume 6 Issue 8: Disability News and Information Service for India
D.N.I.S. News Network, India: While the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment seems to be going ahead with the amendments to the Disability Act despite strong demands from the disability sector to look at the possibility of a new Act, National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (N.C.P.E.D.P) is organizing a National Consultation on October 29 in New Delhi to take this debate to a larger platform.
N.C.P.E.D.P. has also formed a national level Core Group to broadbase this discussion. Javed Abidi will be the Convenor of the group with Vandana Bedi, Consultant, Disability and Development as Joint Convenor. The National Consultation would be organised under the aegis of this Core Group.
It may be mentioned that a delegation of Disabled Rights Group (D.R.G.) met Mukul Wasnik, Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment on August 29 and submitted a detailed letter apprising the Minister about the lacunae in the proposed amendments and the need for a new law. Wasnik also conceded that there were indeed more than a hundred amendments and it was necessary to make a new law instead. However, in a clear deviation from his earlier stand, the Minister recently spoke only about amendments at a recent meet of State Welfare ministers.

Thus spake the Go FAQ. I empathize. I dislike C++ and Java so much that I’ve stayed with C. More precisely, I’ve stayed with GNU C, because of lexical closures and a few other extensions.
Could Go replace C? Does Go truly combine efficient compilation, efficient execution, and ease of use? The best way to judge was to try real systems programming with Go.
A good place to start is the list of GNU Core Utilities. Here are my experiences with implementing some of the simpler utilities.
Thanks to Ivan Krasin, Carlos Cobo, Karl Magdsick, Michael Gehring, and Bob Appleyard for suggestions.
Nowadays I spend most of my energy on Haskell. Go is a natural intermediate step between C and Haskell.
Go’s (:=) operator does type inference. Haskell’s type inference is so powerful that we can write entire complex programs without a single type declaration (though leaving some in is usually preferred for clarity).
Go has channels and goroutines. Haskell has equivalents, along with other powerful constructs for concurrency such as Software Transactional Memory.
Go has interfaces. Haskell has type classes, which can be viewed as generalized Go interfaces. Type classes easily solve one of Go’s biggest problems: lack of generics.
Go has anonymous functions. Haskell has lambdas, currying, type parameters, and type inference which together yield elegant notation for manipulating functions.
Go has numeric constants. Haskell also has numeric literals, but thanks to type classes, we can use constants with user-defined types rather than a specific subset of built-in types.
Go has garbage collection. Haskell does too, but since data is typically immutable (due to purity), garbage collection can be extremely simple and fast.

Im direkten Duell hatte Robert Lewandowski gegenüber Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang das bessere Ende für sich. Der Pole zeigt Mitgefühl für die jüngste Ladhemmung des BVB-Stürmers und hat einen Tipp für Aubameyang parat.
[UltraVid id=3 ]This is not intended as a complete history, rather a look at the highpoints in the café scene which is timely because in recent years, it seems that the term “Café Racer” can be applied to any old motorcycle that has been spray-painted black and fitted with pipe wrap. However, motorcycle enthusiasts who raced each other from café to café were the true Café Racers in the UK during the 1960s. The most famous of which is the Ace Café, in London, which is still in existence today.
There is also a suggestion that the term Café Racer was created as the riders were only pretending to be racers as, instead of using their modified bikes, they just parked them outside cafes to show off.
It may also be part of motorcycle folklore too, but it is rumored that these riders would apparently select a record on a café’s jukebox and then race each other to a predetermined place, with the objective of getting back before the record finished. This would then prove their bike was capable of hitting 100 mph.
A café racer is a lightweight, lightly powered motorcycle optimized for speed and handling rather than comfort – and for quick rides over short distances. With bodywork and control layout recalling early 1960’s Grand Prix road racing motorcycles, café racers are noted for their visual minimalism, featuring low-mounted handlebars, prominent seat cowling and elongated fuel tank – and frequently knee-grips indented in the fuel tank.
The term developed among British motorcycle enthusiasts of the early 1960s, specifically the Rocker or “Ton-Up Boys” subculture, where the bikes were used for short, quick rides between cafés – in other words, drinking establishments.

Thankfully at Inclusion WA we are comfortable with never standing still. While our philosophy is built around constantly striving for improvement, we are also operating in an environment that is ever changing, and on a daily basis it sometimes seems. On coming to power, the new Labor State Government paused previous government commitment to operating a WA NDIS. It may still go down that path but, whatever they decide, hopefully a lot more people living with disability will be involved with the consultation. The McGowan Government have also folded the Disability Services Commission into a large Department for Communities as part of their public service re-structure.
We have created some change of our own, by creating a new business, as you will see below, which has created a fantastic opportunity for our Community Development team to expand the scope of their work and continue to help build an inclusive Western Australian community. We’re also looking to expand our geographical reach over the coming year, so more change is likely. However more information about that will be available in the coming months.
From work opportunities in mental health, to english conversation clubs, markets and gaming for all, there really is a wide array of events happening to cater all interests.
Sophie has found her social niche in the heart of Perth's sweetest high tea spots. Hosting her very own Meetup group has meant she can reflect the diversity of all her personal interests and compile them into a lifestyle she can manage on her own.
As of the 2017-18 financial year, there are some exciting changes for Inclusion WA’s Sport and Community Development Team! For the past 12 months, the Board together with our staff, have been working hard behind the scenes to develop a new organisation – Inclusion Solutions.
Inclusion Solutions will be a sister-organisation of Inclusion WA, and will continue to carry out the same great work throughout Western Australia. Why the change I hear you ask? Over recent years, the scope of the Sport and Community Development Team has broadened and evolved and as such, the team has been working with a greater cross-section of the community. To allow the team the opportunity to focus on new areas of growth and be flexible in adapting to the ever-changing needs of WA communities, the need for a separate entity was seen as a priority and Inclusion Solutions has been developed.
For more information, please visit our website and/or our Facebook page and look out for exciting news related to our staff and the projects we are working on in following editions of the newsletter!
The Youth Disability Advocacy Network (YDAN) committee is a young group of passionate volunteers living with disability who aim to advocate on behalf of their peers. From accessibility requirements around Perth to disability rights and organising events around Perth that help bring like-minded people together as a community.
The 2017IGNITE conference intends to empower young people living with disability, by collating information from service providers, advocacy organisations and community groups - and get this, it's all run by young people living with disabilities (YPWD).
1. To provide a space for young people with disabilities (YPWD) to have a stage to express their concerns about anything pertinent to YPWD.
2. Give young people with disabilities an opportunity to present their projects, research, organisations, achievements/accomplishments.
3. Create a space for issues to be discussed, with people with disabilities being the ones to drive the discussion - industry professions, government officials etc. Will be the external advisors.
4. Provide an avenue for external providers/industry partners/vendors etc. to pitch their products/services for the niche clientele.
5. Facilitate an avenue for innovative YPWD to pitch their ideas and potentially develop their idea into a commercial business through entrepreneurial means.
Holly has dedicated her services to the disability sector for 6.5 years and 1.5 of them, to Inclusion WA. She poetically voices her past, passions for current projects and hopes for the future.
Jason Hartman starts today's episode from Germany, on his way back to the land of capitalism, and he couldn't be happier. After nearly a month in Europe seeing the effects of socialism, Jason's ready to get back to the land where people are more motivated and innovation is more apparent. When governments get involved in picking the winners and losers, nothing good comes out of it, and Jason wants to see America avoid the fate of Europe.
Then Jason finishes his interview with Dr. Nima Sanandaji, originally begun in episode 1028. The two wrap up the interview discussing where the ideas for Adam Smith's "Invisible Hand" really came from, how the Nordic society actually ended up being socialist (and why it doesn't work in the places it's being tried now), and the dangers of government growth.
[2:48] Things in Europe are smaller and not as good of quality. We shouldn't become more like Europe, Europe should become more like the USA
[8:20] Adam Smith's "Invisible hand" had been described in China and the Middle East thousands of years earlier
[14:56] The poor immigrants who left the Nordics for America have descendants that are much better off than those who stayed
[21:57] The Western world needs to learn from history and go back to free market economic policies with minimal government
Jason’s mom will be attending the upcoming Venture Alliance Mastermind trip to Jekyll Island. She decided to prepare herself by reading the updated version of The Creature from Jekyll Island again. She and Jason review sections of the book and discuss the insanity which is the Federal Reserve and how the entity came to be. You are invited to join Jason and his mother on the Jekyll Island trip as a Venture Alliance member or as a guest. If you attend you will experience a piece of American financial history and possibly have your coffee disturbed by a famous hotel ghost.
[3:47] Jason’s mother’s assessment of the book “The Creature From Jekyll Island” and the history of the Federal Reserve.
[12:27] The ghosts of the Jekyll Island hotel do more than drink the guests coffee, they pick pockets too.
[18:28] Past podcasts guests, Chris Martenson and Bill Bonner agree, the Federal Reserve system is convoluted.
Jason Hartman talks with Patrick Parry, Orange County realtor & former investment counselor, about what signs Pat is seeing in the Orange County market that give him pause when it comes to the housing market. Days on market have escalated (some rather significantly) in every price bracket, and inventory continues to increase.
The two also discuss commercial real estate, and how it's a totally different game (with significantly less room for error) than residential real estate.
[21:14] You do not have protections in the commercial real estate world, you better have good lawyers and great research
[33:01] People are always looking in the rear view mirror when it comes to markets, except sellers, they're often banking on the greater fool theory when they price their wares
In today's intro Jason Hartman looks at a few signs in the real estate market that aren't so rosey, as well as adjusting the Brady Bunch house for inflation and seeing how real estate holds up against it (and why linear markets are the better bet for steady appreciation).
Then, in today's 10th episode, Jason talks with Dr. Robert Whaples, Professor and Chair in the Department of Economics, Wake Forest University and co-editor and managing editor of The Independent Review. The two discuss the current Pope's world view and the nature of the Catholic church today.
[2:21] Are there signs of upcoming trouble? There's definitely been a slow down in the higher end markets
[31:24] Where does the Catholic church come in on the uneven playing fields of markets and oligarchies
Just last year Greg Saylor was a corporate software engineer looking for a reliable investment strategy. He found the Creating Wealth podcast and listened during his long commute. He decided to pick up the phone and call one of Jason’s investment specialists. It’s now six months later and Greg has six income properties earning him $4000.00 in monthly income. His due diligence partnered with the extensive data resources available on JasonHartman.com have allowed him to get a step closer to financial freedom.
[26:29] The acquiring of the properties had the most components, everything else is pretty straightforward.
[45:18] Some rules for new investors to follow are to plan for additional expenses, be conservative on your numbers and have a reserve fund.
Jason Hartman starts today's episode from Naples, discussing how, despite what you may think, the demise of America is greatly overstated when you start asking the question "Compared to what?". He also brings a morsel of hope to real estate investors, as housing inventory is showing signs of increasing and home owner equity is at an all time high (but fewer owners than ever are stripping that equity).
Then, in part 1 of the interview, Jason talks with Dr Nima Sanandaji, author of the new book The Birthplace of Capitalism - The Middle East, about how capitalism originally began in what is now Iran and Syria, and how the golden age of the Middle East was during the times of capitalism.
[1:46] Think the US is in decline? Well, compared to what? Because Europe isn't doing that great either
[16:03] Home owners have an estimated $5.8 trillion in accessible home equity, but fewer are taking cash than in previous eras
[29:52] The irrigation for the Middle East was paid for by farm collectives, not the government, spurred on by strong private property rights
[33:27] Cyrus the Great believed the government's only role was to maintain private property and voluntary contract
Jason Hartman is joined by Venture Alliance member Carmen today in Naples, as the two discuss the importance of music on society (and why it might be more important than monetary control), why complaining is actually important, and some good book recommendations for those interested in learning more about the economy and real estate.
Jason also explores the current single family rental demand and what the demographics are looking like for the next 10 years.
[20:44] No place on Earth or time in history has big, intrusive, high tax, government burden made life better for citizens
CW 1026 FBF - The Empowered Investor, Automated Self-Management Technology from Key Please Divyesh Panchal
During today’s episode, Jason shares his appreciation for the ability to self-manage rental properties and the dis-intermediation of single family home sales. The Chief Product Officer for Key Please, Adam Lorentzen joins Jason to describe the sought after service of landlord free, self-showings of rental properties. The Key Please business model focuses on automating the self-management process for owners as well as making the process as easy as possible for renters.
[33:20] This service is for property owners who want flexibility in how they manage their properties
CW 1025 - Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy, Reconfiguring the Three-Player Game between Markets, Speculators & the State with Bill Janeway
Jason Hartman starts off the show from Croatia discussing the difference in investing when there are private companies involved versus when the government is involved. With private companies you know what you're going to get, they're going to follow supply & demand and try to maximize profits. With governments, however, they're much more of a wild card, which can make successfully investing more difficult.
Then Jason talks with Bill Janeway, an active venture capitalist, director of Magnet Systems and O'Reilly Media, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Cambridge in America, and author of the recently revised and updated book Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy. The two discuss the 3 player game and the government's role on both the supply and demand side of the market, the digital revolution and the coming green revolution.
[13:29] There are markets that need government pushing the supply side of things for driving innovation, but sometimes the government even needs to be on the demand side, adding income to support the economy
[17:22] If the government hadn't jumped in on the demand side in the 2009 recession history has shown us what would have happened
[32:09] We've got a new challenge, a new technological revolution, which is the need for a new, green revolution
Jason Hartman does episode 1024 from the bow of a yacht outside of Croatia with Venture Alliance member Carmen. The two discuss inflation's impact on everything from our savings to our real estate, how to deal with trolls in business (and the lawsuits that inevitably follow), and the need for a side hustle.
In the second half of the show Carmen and Jason discuss her Amazon business, which includes how Carmen sources product, the trials of selling on Amazon, and how your business should evolve over time to stay relevant.
[6:13] Inflation destroys the value of our savings, but thankfully it also destroys our (real estate) debt too
[20:58] Life is messy, it's how you handle it that's important. Stay away from the get rich quick stuff.
[36:41] Outlets like Amazon have allowed control of the marketplace to leave board rooms and let individuals call the shots

One media report cited North Atlantic Treaty Organisation officials saying Stoltenberg called an emergency session of alliance leaders after Trump demanded they all lift defence spending to 4 per cent of GDP - even more than the United States spends - or face the US' disengagement from the pact.
"We made a tremendous amount of progress today since past year", Trump said during a surprise news conference Thursday.
"Tremendous progress has been made, everyone's agreed to substantially up their commitment they're going to up it at levels they've never thought of before". He said he was "extremely unhappy" with the situation, but that alliance members have upped their commitments to defense spending in response to his complaints.
Asked about pressures on countries with weaker finances, he said, "We have many wealthy countries with us today but we have some that aren't so wealthy and they did ask me if they could buy the military equipment, and could I help them out, and we will help them out a little bit", he told a news conference.
Trump closed out the tumultuous two-day summit by reaffirming the United States' commitment to the almost 70-year-old alliance and signing the joint declaration, despite spending much of the summit berating allies over defence spending and accusing Germany of being beholden to Russia because it buys Russian natural gas.
Not only did Trump demand on Twitter on Thursday that countries meet the 2% level by this year, not 2024, but he also said all countries should eventually hit 4%, which is more than even the U.S. now spends. But I said, ultimately we should be - in years in advance, we should be at 4 percent.

Conway said Trump is looking for a "commonality" with Russian Federation in order to work for "peace and prosperity", and contrary to Barack Obama, has been "transparent" about his Russian Federation policy. "And I know that's valued very highly over here and people can disagree strongly and still go out to dinner".
Trump also singled out Germany over its low-levels of defense spending - it now spends 1.24 percent of its GDP on defense - and renewed his criticism of a controversial gas pipeline deal between Germany and Russian Federation made a day earlier.

Over the summer, we took a slight leap of faith discussing the outrageous per-40 minute production freshman Marreese Speights (28 points, 15 rebounds, 3 blocks, 68% FG) put up playing limited minutes behind the NBA-bound trio of Al Horford, Joakim Noah and Chris Richard. Many questioned how we could go as far as to call him the #1 NBA draft prospect in the SEC after playing only 6 minutes per game. What they didnt realize was that beyond the numbers, the video we could see of the minutes he did play was that impressive.
Fast-forward to his sophomore year, and Speights is playing quite a bit more, up to 22 minutes per game, and his per-40 production has not dropped as much as you might think. 25.5 points, 14.2 rebounds, 2.7 blocks, and 64% shooting from the field is what hes currently averaging per-40, while his assist-rate has quadrupled, and his turnovers are down by about 15%. Hes also fouling quite a bit less. More importantly, Florida is far exceeding expectations this season in the win-loss column, sitting at 18-3 overall, and 5-1 in the SEC.
Physically, its not hard to tell why Speights has terrific NBA potential. He has good size at 6-10, an NBA caliber frame, super long arms, and impressive athleticism. He runs the court well, has good quickness, is extremely quick off his feet, and is notably explosive finishing around the basket. Hes a very mobile big man, fluid and coordinated, and has excellent hands to boot. Our good friend David Thorpe of ESPNs Scouts Inc recently told us that Speights reminds him somewhat of Al Jefferson, and this seems to be a pretty good best-case scenario comparison.
Offensively, Speights is a back to the basket center all the way, looking most comfortable playing in the paint, but also showing some small sparks of potential with his jump-shot as well. Speights doesnt have the most diverse post-game youll find in the NCAA, but he does a few things extremely well. He is strong enough to establish position fairly well deep inside the paint, and has a terrific jump-hook he can hit with either hand and range out to about 5-7 feet. If closer than that, he likes to finish impressively with a powerful one-handed dunk, aided greatly by his terrific wingspan and the quickness in which he gets off his feet.
Speights can also spin-away from his matchup and knock down a turnaround jump-shot, having the talent to just throw the ball in the basket from tough angles and even under duress. He has absolutely outstanding touch around the basket, and seems to have the potential to even be a legit option in the paint in the NBA as he continues to develop his all-around game. What he lacks in fundamentals, he makes up for with outstanding natural instincts, coming up with plays at times that hint at great things that might come down the road. It wouldnt be a stretch to say that the game comes pretty easy for him. His 64% shooting average from the field ranks 4th amongst all NCAA players in our 2008 or 2009 mock drafts.
As talented as Speights is around the basket, there are still quite a few things he needs to work on. For one, he doesnt always do a very good job establishing position for himself to receive the ball in the paint, not looking quite as motivated as youd hope to dominate his matchup on this end of the floor, and at times, just floating up and down the court aimlessly. You dont always know what youre going to get from him on a nightly basis in terms of his activity level. His ability to read defenses and react to his matchup also leaves something to be desired, as he does not have many real counter-moves in his arsenal, and often seems to decide what he is going to do before he even gets the ball.
Although hes shown some sparks of being able to finish with his left hand, he still doesnt fully trust himself here, preferring to go to his right at times even when hes forced to go against his body to do so. Hes not immune to throwing up bad shots as youd expect a young, somewhat late-blooming big man to (he was not the most highly touted recruit coming out of high school), not always knowing his limitations, and clearly still lacking an incredibly diverse arsenal of post-moves at his disposal at this point.
Facing the basket, we find somewhat of a mixed bag. On one hand, Speights appears to be developing a pretty nice jump-shot from 15-17 feet out, and possesses a pretty soft touch from the free throw line as well. His ball-handling skills are poor, though, meaning hes not yet able to take advantage of his superior athleticism as much as he should when facing up against slower big men. While no one will confuse him with Vlade Divac anytime soon, he does a pretty nice job passing out of double-teams, and generally seems to be a fairly unselfish player who is able to make quick decisions with the ball in his handsall relative to the fairly limited experience he possesses at this point.
Defensively, Speights still has a long ways to go until hed be considered trust-worthy enough by an NBA head coach to see significant minutes at the next level. His fundamentals here are extremely poor, showing very little in terms of a real defensive stance, giving up excessive space in the paint, biting excessively for pump-fakes, not being very effective rotating over to help out on team defense, and doing an extremely poor job hedging the pick and roll. His commitment here leaves a lot to be desired, as hes often fairly lazy closing out on shooters, and generally doesnt seem to put in the greatest effort on this end of the floor. A lot of that has to do with his overall focus-level, which just isnt always there.
Speights can block shots at this level, even if hes not freakishly explosive, but his excellent timing, hands and wingspan really make him a factor. He has a knack for sticking his hands in the right place at the right time, and can even swat away some shots with his left hand. This same knack/timing and terrific tools show up in his rebounding too, where he can be dominant at times when he really puts his mind to it, especially on the offensive end. Hes especially impressive with his ability to tip-in the missed shots of his teammates with terrific touch, and go after his own field goal attempts with a put-back dunk. Hes already the 8th best rebounder per-40 minutes pace adjusted in the country amongst players in our database, and thats despite the fact that he forgets to box out occasionally, and has a tendency to coast from time to time.
As you can probably guess from this write-up, Speights has some extremely unique tools at his disposal that can really get you excited if you catch him on the right night. We actually dont have that many question marks about his combination of physical tools and skill-set (if he continues to develop his game)-- its more about his mental approach to the game that leaves you wondering at times. Hes been criticized by Floridas coaching staff for some of the things weve outlined here, and these issues (effort, commitment, focus, etc) may extend off the court as well depending on whos being asked. That may be a product of his youth, and could certainly improve in time depending on the type of people that are around him. Weve already seen him make big strides in this area as the season moves on (he seems to be getting a lot of tough love from Billy Donovan and co.), and thats why another year in college could be just what the doctor ordered, also in order to further develop his promising skill-set.
16.5 points, 6.5 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.0 steal, 1.0 block, 3.0 turnovers, 50% FG, 78% FT, 39% 3PT
Richard Robys journey as a prospect the past three years is about as strange as youll ever see in college basketball. Following his sophomore season, Roby was viewed as a borderline first round pick, but chose to go back to school and further develop his game. Unfortunately, his development seemed to regress, as his shooting percentage dropped from 42% to 38%, while his three-point shooting percentage dropped from 36% to 27%, even though his offensive burden didnt significantly increase. Now, a senior, Roby has posted career highs in every shooting category, and by significant margins, too.
When looking at Robys game, its important to first mention Colorados new coach, Jeff Bzdelik, who has drastically changed the teams style of play, bringing in a Princeton offense and slowing the teams pace from 73 to 63 possessions per game. The team as a whole is taking much better shots, with their shooting percentage up from 42% to 45%, and three-point shooting up from 31% to 34%. Roby is obviously leading the charge here, as his shot selection is greatly improved, forcing far fewer bad shots, and benefiting from the offenses ball movement with more open looks.
Looking at Robys actual game, his shooting mechanics have cleaned up some, with him being more consistent than he was last year, but still showing a few problems. Most notably, he rarely holds his follow through on his shot, and at times appears to be rushed, which leads to some bad misses. He also has a tendency to push forward on his shot at times, which offsets the advantage he has with his superior length, leaving him prone to being blocked on the perimeter at times. Despite these problems, Roby is still shooting a solid 39% from behind the arc as Colorados go-to scorer, which is a testament to how much natural ability Roby has as a shooter. At times, Robys quick-release is a thing of beauty, most often when he has space and gets his feet set, where his shooting motion is much more consistent and his success is more frequent. If he ever got to work with a shooting coach and really hammered out some of the inconsistencies in his shot, he could be an outstanding shooter, but these are criticisms that have been aimed at Roby as long as hes been a draft prospect.
Roby has also done a very good job utilizing shot fakes from the perimeter this year, faking the three and taking one or two dribbles forward for a pull-up jumper, which he hits fairly well in space. The rest of his mid-range game is pretty inconsistent and unreliable, and to his credit, hes really cut down on using it this year, not taking many off-balanced, contested shots off the dribble, something that hurt him in the past.
In terms of attacking the basket, Roby shows a decent dribble with both hands, though it can be sloppy at times, and he doesnt show much proficiency with it in a crowd. On his dribble-drive moves, he over-relies on his spin move, but does a solid job getting to the basket when in single coverage. Roby isnt especially quick with the ball, and doesnt have an explosive first step, so he probably wont be very good in isolation drives at the next level, though he does do a good job making off-ball cuts. At the rim, he struggles to finish through contact, not possessing the greatest strength, but doesnt really shy away from it, getting to the line a fair share. When he isnt dealing with a weakside defender, Roby shows nice touch off the glass, showing a nice proficiency for using reverse lay-ups, and he can finish with either hand.
On the defensive end, Roby has played well this year, using his hands and length very well to pick off passes even block some shots, while playing fairly aggressive defense in general, showing a solid stance and often contesting shots on the perimeter. Laterally, he is just average, and hes definitely lacking in strength, getting pushed around whenever hes forced to defend the post. Robys rebounding has been much improved this year as well, where he uses his length to come from out of position for boards.
Roby, while just an average athlete, has very good length, and clearly has a lot of natural talent, which makes his potential at the next level intriguing. While hes been a very good college player this season, theres question about how some of his abilities will translate, and if he stands out enough in one area to earn himself a role in the NBA. Roby definitely has the potential to be a stand-out spot-up shooter, but will likely need to work with a shooting coach to fix some of the kinks that lead to his inconsistency in that area. Other than that, he needs to continue to improve his decision-making, something hes already made nice strides with this season. Roby could be a second round pick this year, and will have both pre-draft camps (starting with Portsmouth) and private workouts to attempt to distinguish himself for NBA scouts and executives.
We last looked at Marcus Dove back in October, when we had an opportunity to analyze the entirety of his junior season. Two things were very apparent about the senior at that point: he was one of the best overall defensive players in the country, and he was a non-existent offensive factor. With a little more than half of his senior campaign under his belt, not much has changed defensively, Dove is still a force; but we have begun to see some decent progress on the offensive side of the ball.
The biggest change in Doves play this year has been his level of aggressiveness with the basketball. Previously he was resigned to screen for teammates and to serve as a safety valve if the offense became stagnant, as a result, Dove attempted just over three shots a game and he was very predictable with the ball. The senior has become much more of a scoring threat this year, though, thanks to the work he put in in the offseason, and his increased inclination to attack with the ball. Dove has more than doubled his scoring average from 4.7 a year ago to 10.4 this season, and while his shooting percentage has dropped from 58% to 45%, this is directly related to the senior now taking over eight shots per game.
Perhaps the biggest knock against Dove throughout his career has been his poor ball-handling skills. While he shows great quickness for a player his size, he rarely can beat defenders off the dribble due to the lack of comfort he has handling the basketball. Once in a while, he will be able to take a slower frontcourt player to the basket, but only if he has a straight line to the hoop. Dove certainly hasnt shown a drastic improvement in his dribbling skills this season (his turnovers have actually increased slightly), but he has added a spin move to his arsenal when attacking the basket that allows him to get closer to the rim while on the move. In the past, he was often forced to pull up and elevate over defenders for very difficult, off balance shots, but now through hard work Dove has added this spin move and a jump hook which he finishes with a fair amount of consistency. With his length and pretty good leaping ability, this is a tough move for most defenders to stop either because of a size or quickness mismatch for Dove.
Dove has also improved his touch around the basket. He seems to have spent a decent amount of time in the off-season working on his mid-range game, and while he hasnt shown a lot of ability to pull up and shoot off the dribble, Dove is now able to elevate and finish the occasional runner in the lane when he cant get his spin move off. He is also showing an improvement in his body control when he gets into the lane. While in the past, Dove would merely throw up an awkward shot when heavily contested by defenders, from time to time now he shows the ability to maneuver around opponents to get a better shot off.
While there have been some gradual and subtle improvements to Doves game, there is still a tremendous amount to be desired from an NBA scouts standpoint. Dove is not a perimeter shooting threat, while his percentage has improved this year, he still lacks ideal mechanics. His release is long and slow, and as a result his release point isnt consistent. This also means he needs a fair amount of room to get his shot off, and since he is solely a catch and shoot player beyond the arc, he doesnt get a lot of looks. Dove also still needs to improve his ability to create shot opportunities for himself. He still isnt a threat to pull up off the dribble, and when he does put the ball on the floor it almost a guarantee he is driving right to the basket. Dove has a pretty good back to the basket game for a player primarily out on the perimeter, but at this point his only real move is his jump hook, which he hasnt even perfected yet. At the next level where he often might have the opportunity to take smaller players into the paint with his back to the hoop, Dove will need to further develop this part of his game to be an inside and outside threat.
Defensively, Dove is still a standout. He is able to guard both small forwards and power forwards, proving to be effective against both kinds of players. His length combined with his quickness and aggressiveness makes him a headache for perimeter players; his great anticipation and quick hands have also led to more than two steals per game for Dove. Where he has made some improvements on the defensive side of the ball have been with his physical abilities. At just 215, Dove is fairly thin, and while he hasnt bulked up much since last season, it is apparent that he has gotten stronger. Bigger post players in the past have been able to back him down with a fair amount of ease, forcing Dove to rely on his timing to alter or block shots. From what weve seen this season, though, he is able to hold his ground a little better against stronger players. While bigger bodies (like Blake Griffin on Monday night) will still be able to push Dove around, he is making it harder on opponents than in seasons past.
The increased offensive output this season can only help Dove. He was already considered an intriguing prospect simply because of his athletic frame and strong defensive abilities. At the next level, he will likely be asked to guard small forwards and hybrid power forwards (ala Travis Outlaw, Tyrus Thomas, Shawn Marion), a task he should be able to handle. While he by no means at this point shows the ability to be a consistent scoring option in the NBA, the strides he is making this season are certainly encouraging. Adding a consistent spot-up jumper from the corner (think Bruce Bowen) might be all that it takes now to keep him in the league for years to come. While Oklahoma States play so far will likely keep Dove from showcasing his abilities in the NCAA Tournament, he will get the opportunity to do so at events like the Portsmouth Invitational and the NBA Pre-Draft camp in May.
In a draft class lauded for its guards, three exceptionally talented, and wildly different, forward prospects sit in the top six of our mock draft, each taking a very different path to the top, and demonstrating wildly contrasting strengths and weaknesses. So who is the best prospect among the three?

In this first message of our Smart Home series, we focus on the foundational elements. Let’s meet the Architect of the home and the family—God Himself. His blueprints for the people He creates include satisfying relationships and integrated operation. We should make sure to build alongside of Him so that our homes become satisfying places of refuge, palaces of joy, and platforms for worship. Let’s take a fresh look at Solomon’s instruction.
In this first message of our Smart Home series, we focus on the foundational elements. Let's meet the Architect of the home and the family—God Himself. His blueprints for the people He creates include satisfying relationships and integrated operation. We should make sure to build alongside of Him so that our homes become satisfying places of refuge, palaces of joy, and platforms for worship. Let's take a fresh look at Solomon's instruction.
Although the home is the foundation of society, society is attempting to attack, redefine, and even destroy it. Christians struggle in the area of home and family and often look for answers in the world.
Psalm 127 is a psalm of ascents—a poetic description of what a home and family look like when it depends on God.
Home, marriage and family were God's idea (see Genesis 2:18). The very concept of humanly love was instituted by God.
Even love was God's idea: He has loved us with "an everlasting love" (Jeremiah 31:3); "God is love" (1 John 4:16); "We love Him because He first loved us" (1 John 4:19).
If family was man's invention, then we could regulate it, redefine it, and nullify it. But because it is God's principle it is subject to His standards.
God's covenant name, Lord, in Hebrew is Yahweh. It implies a covenant Lord who loves people and established a covenant relationship with them. In turn, He designed a covenant between people so that His love could spread on a human level.
There are two ways to build a home: smart and not-so-smart. The smart way is to discover the design of the One who designed it. The not-so-smart way is to design it yourself using plans based on self-skill and resources.
In the text, the Lord is depicted as the builder of the home. But home-building involves people as well. The psalm acknowledges a divine builder plus human builders, laborers, and watchmen.
No one can succeed in their assignment of being a Christian husband, wife, or parent without the Lord.
The right approach to home is not "let go and let God" or "I'll go without God" but "let's go with God."
The text refers to the house and the city as the things which are built. These words suggest providing for and protecting the home, but the focus is on who is in the home and what happens there.
Children are a heritage, not an accident or inconvenience. One scholar says that heritage means assignment. Your children are the only earthly items you can take with you to heaven.
The Gospels show Jesus was with His disciples in many aspects of their lives: at home, sharing meals, at work, walking, fellowship, worship, and at death. Jesus was there, and He is here today in all aspects of our lives.
The psalm contrasts the unhappy life of one who is overworked and overly concerned with the happiness of life with God. It compares vanities versus values and projects verses people.
The phrase happy is the man speaks to a pervasive happiness of everyone in the home. A smart home produces happy people:
Our personal commitment to the Lord should affect every relationship in the home. Do you know the Architect? It's never too late to invite Jesus into your life and He will share His abundant life with you. Invite Jesus into your home, and eventually He will take you to His home—heaven.
Connect Up: Why is it important to understand both the Architect and His design for the family? How is the design intricately related to the Designer? Consider both similarities and differences between the design and Designer. For example, the design is not always lived out perfectly—family life sometimes fails—but the Designer is always perfect.
Connect In: How can Christians help encourage, support, and reinforce God's design for home life? Begin with the vertical relationship demonstrated in Psalm 116: believe in Him, cry out to Him, follow Him, study His Word, obey Him, serve Him, thank Him, and live for Him. Then consider horizontal relationships: be there, express affirmation, build healthy morals and values, discipline with consistency, eliminate stress, communicate well, play together, and love your spouse.1 What can you add to these?
Connect Out: What strategies would you take if you observed a home life that was spinning out of control? How could you reinforce the Architect's plans? What steps could you take to encourage rebuilding? Your answers depend on whether the family members are Christians. How might you help both believing and unbelieving families?

1 A Song of Ascents. Of Solomon. Unless the LORD builds the house, They labor in vain who build it; Unless the LORD guards the city, The watchman stays awake in vain.
2 It is vain for you to rise up early, To sit up late, To eat the bread of sorrows; For so He gives His beloved sleep.
5 Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them; They shall not be ashamed, But shall speak with their enemies in the gate.

Stop imagining a better home life and start building it. Whether you're single and just surveying the landscape, married and mediating the man cave versus the she shed, or rebuilding your home (and heart) after significant loss, God has a blueprint for you. No home is beyond repair, so join Skip Heitzig for Smart Home and start building the home of your future today.
Let's turn in our bibles to Psalm 127, Psalm 127. We have these devices. I bet you all have one or you know somebody who has one.
And these now are called smartphones, right? They used to just be phones, mobile phones. And remember the brick phones, those things you could build a house with it and then talk on the phone with it?
And now, because you can connect to so many different places, it's like a pocket computer. It's a smartphone. Now, I don't know how smart it really is. But let's just find out. Siri, are you really all that smart?
See? That not all that smart. One thing about these devices is they're sort of turning us into zombies. I know you've noticed that when you go into places, restaurants, places of business.
You'll see people glued to the screen. You'll see them driving glued to the screen or walking down the street, because they know their peripheral vision can tell if something big is coming their way. And if not, they can use the time to look at the screen.
And it can become problematic. And then there's the people who will talk to you. And while they're talking to you, they got their phone in their hand.
And it's like, oh yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, well, that's very interesting. And then it's the slow head down. It's like, yeah. Yes, right. And so they're just sort of preoccupied with it.
And then a lot of us know the panic that seizes us when we misplace our smartphone. It's like the world has now officially come to an end. I cannot find my phone. How can I communicate and live my next few minutes of life?
And then we get upset if we text somebody, but they don't text us back. And we read into that. Why aren't they texting me back? What's the deal? And are they mad at me?
I mean, all of the emotion that comes along with it-- then the warm fuzzies when they do text us back. You say, OK, everything's good again. And if they make a call, we're especially happy until we find out it's a pocket call, and they didn't really mean to call us. In the first place.
Sometimes you get the feeling that the phone might be smart, but it's making us dumb. You may have heard the one about the guy who went to the doctor and both sides of his face were burned. And the doctor said, what happened?
He said, the phone rang. My iPhone rang. I was ironing my tie and I mistakenly picked up the iron instead of my iPhone. The doctor said, that explains one side. But why both sides of the face? He goes, well, the jerk called me back again.
The last few years, the technology that's on your phone has been translated into the home. There are now smart homes. And what that is is you can, with this device or a computer, you can control the environment in your home.
You can tie it all to the internet. And you can control lights, and clocks, and doorbells, and speakers in your sound system, and window blinds, and garage doors, and thermostats, and hot water heaters. And now, refrigerators are smart, or so they say.
So you can control all those things by a voice command in an app or by pushing a button in an app. Now, I know that with every rise of new technology, there's always some Christians who swear it's the mark of the beast. But the intention that the designers have is to make life easier for you.
Well, we're doing a series called Smart Home. And the subtitle is Building Your Home Of The Future. What we are doing is consulting God's blueprint to find out how relationships in the home should function.
Now, why are we doing this? Because over the past history of this church, I have talked on this issue before. Well, number one, we're doing it because home is the foundation of society.
It's the heart and soul of any society. All societies were built on the home. And if the home gets destroyed, you are effectively undermining society. So we're doing it, because the home is foundational.
A second reason we're doing this series is because, though society does need the home, at the same time society is attacking the home. Society itself, though it desperately needs strong home units, is sending out signals to redefine or reconfigure or challenge the traditional home. Some are saying that the home, the family, is outdated. We need to move on and get over it and not celebrate it.
And a lot of these new ideas about human relationships are being taught in universities. So, effectively, we're training future leaders to undermine what has made our society great to begin with. Third reason I'm doing this is because I have discovered over the years that that one overarching area that Christians struggle with the most happens to be in the home.
And because they don't know the clear understanding of God's blueprint, they look for answers in the unbelieving world, the counterpart in the unbelieving world. They're emulating the worldly counterpart. So I want us to get smarter.
I want us to get smarter at relationships. I want us to get smarter at dating, and smarter at picking a mate, and smarter at maintaining a marriage, smarter at blending families if that's the situation you find yourself in, smarter at recovering after a break down and a divorce, smarter at being single again, smarter at remarriage. And so we call it a smart home.
Today, we start where we ought to start. And that is the very foundation itself. And that would be consulting the architect, God, the architect who gave the blueprint.
Now, I don't know if we have any architects in the house with us, but I have heard from friends of mine who are architects. They say, you know what the frustrating thing about being an architect is? People who come to you and ask you to design a home for them, but you discover they've already designed it.
And they just want your hand on the pen. And they'll tell you where to put it. And they want to design it. And he goes, I love their input. But it's hard for me to design what they've already designed and then just to put my stamp of approval on it.
In Psalm 127, we have a poem, a psalm, five verses. But notice what it says, "unless the Lord builds the house, they labor in vain who build it. Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain--" or for nothing.
"It is vain--" or useless, futile-- "for you to rise up early and sit up late to eat the bread of sorrows, for so he gives his beloved sleep. Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord. The fruit of the womb is a reward.
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are the children of one's youth. Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. They shall not be ashamed, but shall speak with their enemies at the gate."
Now, when it says house, unless the Lord builds the house, it's not speaking about a physical structure. It's not speaking about a building. It's speaking about what happens inside the building and, especially, those who are in the building.
It's speaking about a home. Sometimes the Old Testament will use the word house as a synonym for what goes on inside of it, the home, the family life. And that is the idea here. Now, you'll notice that the psalm begins-- even before verse one, it has a little superscription above it that says "a Song of Ascents," do you read that, a Song of Ascent of Solomon?"
So we believe Solomon wrote this psalm. Not David, but David's son, Solomon, he wrote it. And a Song of Ascents-- there are 15 Old Testament psalms that are called Psalms of Ascent. They're short psalms.
And they're called Psalms of Ascent, because we believe that when the children of Israel ascended the hill up to Jerusalem, that they had memorized these and sang them as a family, as a group, as they were going to worship in the temple. Also, once they got to the temple, there was an outer temple and an inner temple, an outer courtyard.
And it was separated by a raised platform of 15 steps upon which stood the Levites, who sang the Songs of Ascents antiphonally. One would sing one part. One would sing the other part.
And that filled the temple of God and the worship of God's people. So because Solomon wrote it, some have mistakenly said, well, this is a psalm about the city of Jerusalem and the house of the Lord, the temple. It is not.
Because if you keep going on, it talks about a man and a wife having children that happen to be from the Lord. And they launched them. So the city and the house that he speaks of is essentially a synonym for the home.
That's what this is. Psalm 127 is a poetic expression of a family that depends on God. That's a smart home, a family that depends on God.
Now, a smart home, according to this psalm, has four elements. And I have taught on this psalm on a number of occasions, but I'm looking at it differently. And I'm outlining it differently.
So the four elements are the designer, the builders, the dwellers, and the enjoyers. And there is some overlap. Let's begin with the designer. Look at the third word in in verse one. And what word is that?
Lord. That's how it begins, unless the Lord builds the house. So the psalm begins highlighting God. Why? Because he is the very one who thought up the idea of the home. That's why.
It was God who in Genesis 2 said, it is not good that man should be alone. I'm going to make a helper that is suitable for him. It is the Lord who, it says, brought the woman to the man.
I've always loved that verse. God is like the father of the bride giving away the bride. The Lord brought the woman to the man.
So the home was God's idea. Marriage was God's idea. The family was God's idea. Society was God's idea.
In fact, love was God's idea. Where did the whole concept of love originate? God. In Jeremiah 31, God tells the children of Israel, I have loved you with an everlasting love.
What that means is, before you were even born, before you even knew what love was, I was there planning for you and loving you. I've loved you with an everlasting love. In the New Testament First John Chapter 4, it says, we love Him because He what?
Same chapter said, love is of God. So it's important that we realize that God had this idea to begin with of love, marriage, home, family. It was all his idea.
You never read in the Bible, now in the course of time, man had the bright idea of a way to get a good tax break. So he married a woman, had a bunch of kids, and life was good. It always begins with God.
Now, why is that important? I'm stating the obvious. Why am I doing that? For this reason-- if it was man's invention, then man can regulate it.
If it was man's invention, then man can tamper with it. If it was man's invention, then he can nullify it. He can tweak it. He can redefine it all he wants.
But because it was God's idea, it is subject to God's principles. Because it was God's idea, as Jesus said, concerning marriage, what God has joined, let no man separate. It was his idea.
Now, something else-- notice the word Lord. If you look at it, what's odd about it? It's in all what?
Capitals. Whenever you read that in your Old Testament, that's significant. It's not a general word for Lord. It is not a generic name. It's the covenant name.
Capital L, capital O, capital R, capital D would probably be pronounced in Hebrew Yahweh or Yah-veh. We don't exactly know how it was pronounced, because we are left with Hebrew consonants only. It's called the tetragrammaton.
But that's the personal name of God. That's how God introduced himself to Moses when Moses said, OK, I'll be your spokesperson, but who do I say sent me? What's your name?
And God said, I am who I am. I am who I am. That's his name, Yahweh, the becoming one, or the immutable one.
It describes his character. I'm bringing this up, because that's the Lord whose idea it was. The covenant Lord who loves people and established a covenant with people in turn designed a covenant for people, so that on a human level that love can spread.
So he's the designer of the home. He's the divine architect. He is the great blueprint maker. And that's significant in any home in any relationship.
When I was first engaged and my wife and I went through-- my fiance at the time-- a marriage prep, we were given a book, a little workbook. And there was one little diagram that I came across that was very instructive to me. It's very basic.
And you're going, I know that stuff. I've been there. But to me, it was revolutionary. It was so simple. And I needed simple.
I'm a guy who needed simple. So it was a little triangle drawn in this book. And the triangle said this is a Christian relationship.
The top of the triangle, the pinnacle, said God. The bottom said husband. The other bottom said wife.
And the author was trying to get a very important point across is that the closer you both individually come to God, the closer you get to each other. You strengthen the bond by seeking the Lord. And I'll never forget that. And that's been a principle, a driving principle, of our relationship.
Now, because it was God's idea, then it's really no wonder that the Bible will often highlight this theme over and over again. The Bible is a prominent biblical theme. It exalts the home.
God has a lot to say about it in both the Old and the New Testament. This thread gets woven over and over again. There's instruction. There's examples both good and bad. It's all through the text of scripture.
So it leaves us with two ways to build a home. Speaking of simple, let's get simple. Two ways to build a home-- the smart way and the, let's just say, not so smart way. So you got the smart way and the not so smart way.
What's the not so smart way to build a home? The not so smart way to build a home is you build it, you design it, and then you just sort of plop it down and ask God to bless it. That's not so smart.
You come up with your own ideas, your own skill, your own knowledge, your own resources, and then go, oh yeah, by the way, God? Would happen to bless my deal? That's not so smart.
The smart way to build is to discover the design that the first designer already designed. You start with that. Because he invented it, he knows how to make it function at peak. When you do that, you start discovering the thrill that this psalm speaks of of God at work in providing for your home and protecting your relationship. So that's the designer.
Now, let's consider the builders. And notice I put it in the plural, builders. There's not just a builder. There are builders.
Now, you're thinking, wait a minute. The psalm says there's just a builder, the Lord. Well, keep reading, "unless the Lord builds the house, they labor."
Who are they? The ones in this home. So God is the builder, but it says "they labor in vain--" who what?
Build it. So God is building it, and they are building it. So the psalm includes a divine builder, God, and human builders, human laborers, human watchmen.
This verse is simply stating the idiocy of trying to go it alone in life, of trying to build it on your own. Because the person who does that is tired and unsuccessful. It's all in vain. They're spinning their wheels. They're not seeing the desired result.
So this verse is sort of like Philippians 2, where Paul says, work out your own salvation in fear and trembling. And then the next verse is, for it is God who works in you both to will and do of his good pleasure. So both are true.
God gives you the energy and the power, but he expects you to work at it. God works in you, but you still have to do the work. This is also like Second Corinthians Chapter 3 Verse 6. Not that we are sufficient of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God or from God.
All of that to say this. You'll never pull off the assignment of being a Christian husband without the Lord. You'll never be able to be the wife God wants you to be or the parent God wants you to be or successfully date a person without the Lord building with you. You got to build. But if you build without the Lord, that's not smart.
So here's the big point this. Life is lived at its best when you build alongside the Lord. Life is lived at its best when you build alongside the Lord.
I love how Second Corinthian 6 Verse 1 begins-- we then as workers together with him. I like that approach. And that is the approach.
The right approach your home is not let go and let God. I've heard that for years. Just let go and let God. That's not the approach to building a home.
Nor is it I'll go without God. That's not smart. We should be saying, let's go, God. I'll go with God.
You want to build. You want to put all you can into it, but you want to also acknowledge the divine architect. So a smart home begins by recognizing first who the designer is, the architect.
Second, it includes the wisdom of building alongside the designer using his design. There's an old saying that says little is much if God is in it. Little is much if God is in it. The reverse is also true. Much is nothing if God isn't in it.
Now, the psalm goes on to describe what it is you're building. It enumerates relationships. That's what you are building in a home. A smart person will be all about building relationships.
It's called a house. And it's called a city at first. But these two words are pictures of edifying, building up, providing for, and giving protection to the home, the home environment.
Now, Verse 3 elaborates on that. Look what it says. "Behold--" I love verses that begin that way, behold.
It's such a biblical word. It probably would be best translated, hey, check this out, or look at this, or let me have your attention. Or we might say in our modern vernacular, put your phone down and listen to this.
"Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord. The fruit of the womb is a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are the children of one's youth.
Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. They shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with their enemies in the gate. Happy is the man."
So all of this is about building a family, building relationships within the family. If you were to take your life down to its irreducible minimum where there is just no more, just the nuts and bolts, you strip away your things, your home, your cars, your hobbies, you come down to just the basic components, what you have as a single word, relationships. Good or bad or stale or vibrant, but that's what you have-- relationships.
Now, notice that it says children are a heritage. It doesn't say children are an accident from the Lord. It doesn't say children are a curse from the Lord. Or it doesn't say children are an inconvenience from the Lord.
Children are a heritage. One translation says children are a gift from the Lord. In fact, one translation says, children are God's best gift.
Now, I know every parent questions this at some point of a child's development. Usually the first few months is the first big question. And then teenage years is like the second time they question. Heritage? I don't know about that.
But one source-- and I like this-- says that the word heritage should be translated assignment. Now, think about this. Children are God's assignment.
How are you doing with your homework, your assignment, your commission from God? Now, so God knows exactly what personality of children to give to us, lend to us, in that assignment. A lot of times we parents think, well, I am here to shape the destiny of my child.
That's true you are. You are. You are. But have you ever thought that your children are there to help shape your own personality and destiny? And though you might get frustrated with their personalities, God could be using them to shape you as well.
So they're an assignment. And why are they so important? And why does he highlight this relational part of the home? It's simple.
Children are the only earthly items you can take with you to heaven. You'll never take anything else. You can't take it with you. But them, you can. So they're worth investing in.
They're a reward. Then there's grand-parenting. And that's where the reward is really realized. Because grandkids are a whole different level of enjoyment. Our grandchildren are God's reward for not killing your children.
And what I love about grandkids-- they're an assignment from the Lord. But they're not my assignment now. They're my son and daughter-in-law's assignment, but they're my grandkids.
So I'll fill them with sugar and send them home and play with them and let them do whatever they want, because I like to spoil them-- pure reward. So we looked at the designer and the builders. Now, let's just take it a deeper level, the dwellers.
Shall we open the door and see who is in this home? Let's meet them. In Verse 5, it says, happy as they what? The what?
The man. So we got a man in this home. That's good. And we have somebody else if you go back to Verse 3. "Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord, the fruit of the womb."
So you have to have a wife, a woman. That's where a woman comes from. So you got a man and his wife. And then the phrase before that-- children.
So you've got a man, and wife, and children that comprise this home that is highlighted in the psalm. But there's more. Who else is mentioned in this psalm as being part of this unit? The Lord several times.
In Verse 1, the Lord builds. In the same verse, the Lord guards the city. You got to be inside the city in order to guard the city.
Also, you'll notice in Verse 2, God is giving the inhabitants of this home sleep. It says, "for so he gives his beloved sleep." So he's the Lord of the bedroom in this relationship. I'll press it even further, hope it and make you feel uncomfortable. He's the Lord of your sexual relationship.
In fact, I know this to be true, because Verse 3 shows that God is responsible in part in the production of children. I mean, you've got to work at that, but God is the one who ultimately blesses that. It's a reward.
Now, I just gotta say, if you're unable to have children, we'll get to that at a future study. God has lots of creative ways to reward you besides children. But in this case, God is rewarding them with that.
So he is describing the Lord as one who is involved in the production of children. That's how he's building the city. Here's the grand point I want to make here.
The idea of a man, a wife, children, and the Lord in this home is simple. God wants to be part of every part of your life. God wants to be part of your family life.
He wants to be in your kitchen. He wants to be in your dining room. He'd like to be in your living room, your bedroom, your garage, your work room, your home office, your entertainment room.
He wants to be a part of it all. He doesn't want to be regulated to, well, there's the Bible on the nightstand, so anytime God is brought into our home and on Sunday. He wants to be a part of every part of your life.
I have a booklet that I got early on in my Christian walk called My Heart, Christ's Home. The author is Robert Boyd Munger. And he draws a picture of a man who invites Christ into his life, into his heart.
And because Jesus said, I stand at the door and knock, he pictures the heart as the home that he comes into. He wants to live inside of us. So he takes that idea and expands on it.
So he said, I invited Jesus into my home, my heart. And first, we went into the library. And he looked around at what I was reading. He said, ah, we got to change some of that.
So he redecorated. And he changed the things I was reading, my reading material. He brought Jesus into the dining room. And he says, Jesus started changing my appetites and my desires.
I took Jesus into the living room. He looked around and goes, I like this room. Let's spend a lot of time together here. You and I, we'll fellowship.
I took him into the workroom where Jesus said, I promise to help you in your work. I want to be a part of your career. And he finally said, I took him down to the entertainment room, the rec room.
And he wanted to redecorate that as well. In the booklet, he says, "then we went down into the entertainment room of the house, and he transformed it. He brought into life real joy, real happiness, real satisfaction, new friends, new excitement, new joys. Laughter and music have been ringing through the house ever since."
I love that. Laughter and joy have been ringing through the house ever since. I love the idea of the Lord being a part of every aspect in a family's life.
Question I have for you is have you invited him to be a part of every area in your home. Have you sincerely asked the Lord to help you launch these arrows, these children? Have you asked him to give you a fulfilling sex life?
Have you asked him to balance your time of work and family? Have you asked him to replace your appetites with better desires? As a young believer, I learned this lesson.
I had this weird idea at first that God was really only interested in me when I was sitting in church with my Bible open singing a psalm or a hymn or praying about missions. And that was kind of the extent of it. It was a skewed way to look at God. If I was talking about theology, God'd like that, but that's about it.
But it a warped way of thinking. I discovered that the Lord really wanted my fellowship in all aspects of my life, all areas he wanted to be brought into and be the Lord of. And I discovered that because I realized when Jesus was with his disciples, I mean, he ate with them.
One time, he even cooked them breakfast. I've always wondered what he cooked them. Besides the fish, I mean, did he spice it up? Did he had stuff with it? And was it medium rare?
I mean, how did Jesus cook the breakfast? That's just kind of cool to think about. He spent time walking with them. He went fishing with them, a lot of different life activities.
Then in the Garden of Eden, it says the creator God was coming every day in the cool of the day to walk with his first human creations-- love that picture. So when I discovered that, I decided I'm going to go to the beach and pray. And I went to the beach, and I prayed.
But this time, I prayed for waves. I wanted to have fun. And I wanted God to be part of the fun. And I wanted him to bless-- it's his ocean. Just make some good shaped waves, Lord.
And I prayed for it, and the Lord answered. And I spent a day on my surfboard rejoicing and having incredible fellowship with God, especially in between the waves that he gave me. But I took that way of thinking that this is fun and God wants to be a part of it, into snowboarding, and bicycling, and motorcycling, and dating my wife.
Because First Timothy Chapter 6 Verse 6 says, "we are to trust in the living God who gives us richly all things to enjoy." The Lord wants you to enjoy life and enjoy him in your life. So the designer, the builders, the dweller-- speaking of joy and enjoyment, let's end on this, the enjoyers, the enjoyers.
I'll explain. There's a single word in Verse 5 I want to sort of isolate and then bring it back into context. It's the first word. What's the first word of Verse 5?
Happy. [HEBREW] in Hebrew means blissful, contented, satisfied. It could even be translated, oh, how happy. "Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. They shall not be ashamed, but shall speak with their enemies in the gate."
That's what a smart home will do. It makes happy people. It produces happiness. In fact, the whole psalm is a contrast between an unhappy person, who is overworked and overconcerned, who spins his wheels day and night and really doesn't see any result, so he's not happy, versus a happy person that the Lord blesses in Verse 5.
So Verse 2 is somebody investing in activities, but producing anxieties. And Verse 5 is somebody who is investing in priorities and shaping destinies. And one is unhappy and unfulfilled, and one is happy and fulfilled.
The first is a house built on vanities. The second is a home built on values. And the contrast couldn't be clearer. So those are two ways to do life.
You can build projects. You can build people. The contrast here is you can build projects for temporal profit, or you can build people for spiritual eternal profit.
You can do both. But if you have to take one or the other, the second is more preferable. Now, it says in Verse 5, "happy is the man."
And before you think, oh great, God's all about making the man happy, the idea is that it begins with the man, but it's pervasive. It's including everyone. The only reason the man is mentioned-- and man is sometimes generic for the person.
But sometimes it's speaking of the man in particular. And that is simply because, thousands of years ago, all societies were patriarchal in nature, male dominant in nature. And so it speaks of him or it speaks to him, because he leads the home. That's all.
Serve the Lord. Now, that implies I'm making the statement. But we as my family, we've all gotten together, and we're all in on this. We have decided, they have decided along with me, that's what we're going to do. So I'm now making the statement as the head of the home.
So happy is the man. And happy is his wife. And happy are the children and the grandchildren in this home.
And they're happy, because the Lord has designed it, and the Lord has helped them build it, and the Lord has strengthened and provided for and protected this home. And they're happy, because children were not only born into this home, but launched from this home. And you get to Verse 5, you figure out they were launched successfully.
And the children are making an impact in society. Notice this. And I really had never noticed this part before as I did this time.
"Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them. They--" who are they? The children here. "They shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with their enemies at the gate."
In ancient times, the gate was the courtroom or the newsroom. It's the place where business was conducted. So the enemies at the gate-- you have a child who has been raised up and is now able and articulate to defend against enemies that would seek to undo this home. The point being is the children have been launched like arrows.
And I would say this. Not only is this home happy, but because they are happy-- and it's a successful home with children who love and serve the Lord who are making an impact in society-- the neighbors are happier. The city is happier. It impacts everyone.
So let me boil it down as we close. Our personal relationship with God-- and now I'm just assuming you all have one. Our personal relationship with God should affect every relationship in our home. It should affect every relationship in our lives.
The great missionary to China, Hudson Taylor-- he founded the China inland mission-- said, "if your father, and mother, sister, and brother, if the very cat and dog in the house are not happier for you being a Christian, then it's a question whether you really are." And that's a good way to end. Are you really?
Have you met the architect? Do you know the architect? You can answer that by looking at a life? Is that person building according to the plans, submitting their plans to him, walking in honor of him?
Let's go back to what Jesus said using the motif of a home. Behold, I stand at the door, and I knock I'm knocking at the door. If you open the door and let me in, I'll come in and I'll dine with you. I'll have fellowship with you.
Like that little booklet, I'll come in and invade your space. And Jesus would say to you, if you invite him into a your life, he will share his life with you. If you invite him into your home, he will take you one day to his home.
"In my Father's house, there are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I'm going to go prepare a place for you." That's the promise. Invite him into your life, your home, and live now according to his architectural plans.
Father, we want to thank You for Your word. It's clear. And we love that whether it's in a poetic fashion, like Psalm 127, or purely didactic fashion, a straightforward teaching instruction like in Ephesians 5, or you have good examples or bad examples-- where learn about how we're to get along and how we are to be able to blossom with each other.
That's good in your eyes. You said, it's not good that we are alone. You said, it is good when we are together. You've designed us to be interactive.
And I pray, Lord, that You would show us how to maximize our strengths and gifts in the homes that You have given us, that ours would be a smart home and, by that, giving You glory. In Jesus' name, Amen.

Dating can be exciting. It can also get weird and end poorly. I like the common sense of one who quipped, "Some people are unmarried for the same reason that some drivers run out of gas. They pass too many filling stations looking for their favorite brand!" Though dating was unknown in biblical times, let’s look at five principles in budding relationships to help you prequalify to build a solid, long-lasting, and satisfying Smart Home.
Should the top priority of a single person be to get married? Can a Smart Home also be a minimalistic home—with just one occupant? Why is it that singleness is sometimes considered less acceptable than marriage? Can the single life be a full, enriching, and positive experience? Perhaps you’ve lost your mate or you’re still waiting to find one. Or maybe you’re happy to stay single. Today let’s consider singleness and celibacy in light of Scripture.
To live in a Smart Home, occupants must follow the architect’s blueprint. God, the inventor of marriage, has given roles to husbands and wives so they can live together in harmony and joy. The basic role of a husband is to love his wife. This love is explained and described by the architect in the building documents found in Ephesians 5. This kind of love that a husband lavishes on his wife will enable her to fulfill her role with greater ease and deeper contentment.
When it comes to a family’s roles within the home, the “S” word (submission) can generate controversy. To modern ears, God’s standards can seem out-of-date and even distasteful to some. But I am suggesting that the quickest way to fulfillment for a married woman is to discover the freedom of her role as properly understood in Scripture. So let’s jump in and unpack this role and see how it is meant to correspond to a husband’s loving leadership.
The construction of a house is no small undertaking. After the blueprints have been drawn up and approved, there are a series of steps to take to ensure the building is strong and durable. The verses we are considering today give us the preliminary features necessary to live peacefully with another person. Before the roles of family members can ever be exercised successfully, these considerations come first.
Is a lifetime commitment to a spouse even reasonable? Does permanence have to become a goal if it means a couple just has to grin and bear it? What if a marriage hinders one’s personal growth and self-fulfillment? Today I want to make a case not just for getting married but also for staying married. Let’s go back to the divine architect’s original prototype to understand what He had in mind when coming up with this idea of marriage.
Being intimate with your spouse involves more than just sex (though it certainly includes that). Intimacy is a sense of caring and affection in which one can be totally vulnerable with someone without the fear of being hurt or misunderstood. The physical/sexual factor should only enhance that. Intimacy is essential if a marriage is going to thrive. Let’s recover four components of marital intimacy.
God’s plan for the family is to build, strengthen, and protect it. But Satan has declared war on the family as he seeks to undermine, weaken, and destroy it. The statistics are staggering: the divorce rate has risen over 700 percent in this century, and there is one divorce for every 1.8 marriages. Since communication is key to oneness in marriage, Nate Heitzig examines the Scriptures to find how to deal with communication breakdown in a marriage, both how to prevent it and how to repair it.
Every wedding creates a blended family. Marriage not only joins a man and a woman, it blends the extended family of mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, sisters-in-law, and brothers-in-law. The odds for dysfunction run pretty high. Today we consider the roles of God, parents, in-laws, and married children doing life together. How can in-laws be prevented from becoming outlaws? Four principles apply:
The issue of money in a marriage is a primary source of conflict and worry, so much so that this conflict often leads to collapse. How can a married couple handle their finances so the marriage relationship isn’t damaged? Using an example of the apostle Paul’s plan to raise funds for the Jerusalem church, let’s get some solid pointers on the believer’s (and hence believing couples’) relationship to finances. Like it or not, money matters.
Many have heard the saying, "If looks could kill…" The truth is, looks can kill, spiritually speaking: temptation leads to sin and sin leads to death. In this teaching, Pastor Nate Heitzig examines two admittedly uncomfortable topics: temptation and adultery. In light of Jesus’ teaching in Matthew 5:21-31, two strategies emerge for how to stop temptation before it starts, and how to stop temptation once it starts.
A mother's love is great—it sets the standard of unconditional love. God has done and continues to do great things through women. The Bible records numerous faithful and spiritually fruitful women, such as Jochebed (Moses' mother), Ruth, Esther, Elizabeth, and Mary. In 1 Samuel, we meet Hannah, a woman whose faith modeled three powerful truths about mothers.
Some of the most struggling and lonely people in our congregation may be those who are single parents. They may be moms, dads, divorced, or never married. They may be young teenagers; they may be older grandparents—but they all have this in common: they are raising children by themselves. Does the Bible speak to this? Are there any clues for Christians to understand so we can help bear the load of single parents among us? Yes, there are. Let’s take a look at them.

OLIVER Group has collaborated with the Guardian, to launch Learn about the world of… The Media Planner: a vibrant, vintage, tongue-in-cheek guide that details a humorous and surprisingly accurate account of life in a media agency.
The B2B initiative is being sent to media planners across London, and aims to cut through the noise and explain the value and effectiveness of the Guardian’s platforms and audiences when planning campaigns.
On-site specialist OLIVER’s dedicated, in-house team at Guardian News & Media collaborated with Hoot Comedy to create the campaign. Boasting a playful, nostalgic design harking back to vintage children’s books, The Media Planner’s striking presentation and content aims to stand out from the endless streams of letters, emails and cold-calls.
Following two fictional campaigns of wildly varying success, The Media Planner’s story concentrates on the ‘adventures’ of Claire, David, Toby and Julian. The first two succeed by planning their campaign with the Guardian, while the latter pair run a poorly devised promotion into the ground amid a flurry of expletives, budgetary mishaps and questionable hashtags.
The Media Planner is part of the Guardian's ongoing Platform for Action campaign and highlights the power of the brand to inspire readers into action through a whole range of creative solutions.
Hamish Nicklin, chief revenue officer at Guardian News & Media, commented: “The media industry is a vibrant, noisy space and we wanted to find a fun way to draw attention to the Guardian’s impressive credentials. As a quality, legacy publisher we have a trusted relationship with our readers - this means we can help brands reach people effectively and positively. The grown-up guide is a playful look at the world we live in and a reminder that the Guardian’s quality delivers results.”
Brian Cooper, chief creative officer at OLIVER, said: “The Guardian wanted something different, because it knows that media planners are busy and needed something to catch their attention, and was willing to let us try something new. Developed by our bespoke team housed in the Guardian’s offices, The Media Planner is a prime example of OLIVER’s creative and strategic capabilities being used to their full potential and landing the key objectives for our client.”
In-house specialist OLIVER UK is bolstering its creative team with three key hires: Kevin Bratley joins as creative director, while brother-and-sister duo Jade and Lee Trott assume roles as art director and copywriter respectively.
In-house specialist OLIVER UK has been appointed as the lead design agency for Spire Healthcare, a leading private healthcare provider in the UK.

This is now the third pressure control I've installed on the pump. The first time I messed with the cut on and off pressure by adjusting the tension on the screws and found out after from the company that the control should not be adjusted.i bought another one on eBay and I was having the same problem without adjusting the control. Finally I bought a third control directly from the company and one again without messing with the 30-50psi factory calibrated cuts, I had fast cycling almost immediately, without running a zone at all. This was happening in the process of priming the pump.
I am at a complete loss and Wayne is near impossible to get in touch with for tech support. The pump is inoperable in current conditions. I have a pressure gauge attached at the discharge side to measure my throughput and the gauge goes nuts when the pump cycles, obviously.
It's possible I could have an air leak somewhere because the pressure at initial priming would reach cut off psi and then cycle back on after the pressure dropped a touch. After that the cycling is out of control.
I have a rubber fitting where the wellpoint exits the ground and right angles to continue into the housing, it's an 1-1/4" x 1-1/2" fitting with screw clamps and it is pvc glued on both ends.

Cook County GOP Chairman Mary Petz distributed literature at the GOP caucus that was held Tuesday, Feb. 6 at the little log building at the Cook County Community Center. Only 20 people attended, enough to get a lot of business done. Staff photo/Brian Larsen Two years ago 139 people turned out for the Cook County GOP BPOU caucus. This year 20 braved the cold Feb. 6 night to attend the almost three-hour-long caucus held at the Cook County Community Center log building.
Current GOP county chair Mary Petz opened the meeting, and Butch Piepho gave the invocation. Paul Just gave the treasurer’s report, and he lobbied for someone to run for his position, which was up at this meeting. In the end, only his wife, Catherine, agreed to run for treasurer and she was unanimously voted in for the next two years.
A large envelope for donations for the local Basic Political Operating Unit (BPOU) was distributed, and money was collected to help with the 2018 budget.
Petz said much of last year’s budget was spent on advertising, convention fees, and setting up the 2017 Fisherman’s Picnic booth.
Taking up a discussion from last year that was still unresolved, Petz said she had acquired examples of GOP BPOU constitutions and bylaws.
A look back into records said Petz, and a review of what is registered at the state level indicates that Cook County Republicans have never had either a constitution or bylaws. Petz said she would email the examples she had found to those who wished to go over them and then present a finished copy to be discussed at the county’s upcoming March 15 meeting that will be held at the Cook County Community Center. Hopefully, said Petz, at that meeting, a vote will be taken to establish Cook County Republican bylaws and constitution.
Several letters from GOP gubernatorial candidates were read, and then a straw poll was held. Mary Giuliani Stevens and Jeff Johnson each received four votes, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty got three votes, and Keith Downey received two votes. Two ballots were left undecided.
Butch Piepho read a letter from Doug Wardlow, who is running against current DFL Attorney General Lori Swanson for her seat. Swanson has announced she will also run for another four-year term. It’s been 46 years since a Republican was elected attorney general in Minnesota, said Piepho, adding it was about time to choose someone with conservative values in that position.
Once letters had been read, each table formulated resolutions and elected precinct officers to attend the Thursday, March 15 BPU Convention that is scheduled to be held at the Community Center at 7 p.m. At that meeting, delegates will be selected to carry resolutions to the Eighth District Republican Convention that will be held April 9 in Park Rapids. Cook County delegates will also be chosen to attend the State Convention held in May in Duluth. The National Republican Convention will be held July18-21 in Cleveland, Ohio.
Traditional themes once again were threaded through the Standing Platform of the Republican Party of Minnesota’s 11 planks. These included “promoting economic prosperity, restoring and defending civil rights, protecting health care, educating children, strengthen families and communities, protecting public safety, strengthen the rule of law, enjoying and protecting our natural resources, making government smaller and better, and defending America at home and abroad.” Each precinct table wrote one or more resolutions in support of a plank or planks, and those will be carried to the Congressional District Convention where they will be voted on. Should they pass they will be forwarded to the State Convention, and if adopted there, they would be incorporated into the Standing Platform of the Minnesota Republican Party.
Toward the end of the meeting, Paul Just reminded that the political contribution refund program had been reinstated in 2017. Political contributions of $50 for individuals and $100 for couples given to local or state party units or to candidates for office who have a signed agreement with the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Disclosure Board would be refunded if the proper paperwork was submitted.

The top three ladies in Saturday’s BSP Women’s Triathlon. From left, Alyce Edwards in third, winner Amy Coulton, and runner-up Harriet Browning.
It was another successful event for the annual BSP Women’s Triathlon that was held in Tikioki on Saturday.
The weather was picture-perfect for 11 individuals and 8 teams to tackle the 400m swim, 16km cycle and 4km run – however the sun was out and it was hot.
Our article last week talked of a possible dark horse, and this certainly came true, with Amy Coulton of Ariki Adventures taking out the title this year in her debut race in a time of 54 minutes 55 seconds.
It was a great race for everyone, and the front runners were certainly all gunning for first place, with Harriet Browning and Amy coming out of the swim first, followed closely by Alyce Edwards.
A little further back was Lucy McDonald and Adrianna Skurosz, who had some time to catch up on the cycle course.
A strong cycle leg by Alyce saw her jump into first position, overtaking both Harriet and Amy to have a small lead into the run leg.
But it all came down to the run, with Amy passing Alyce in the first two kilometres, and a fast-paced Harriet hot on their heels, passing all the others and chasing down Amy, but not quite making it – taking out second place just 40 seconds behind.
Alyce kept her strength up on the run to keep a determined Adrianna and Lucy away from her, taking out third place just 37 seconds after Harriet, with Adrianna and Lucy next, taking out the fourth and fifth places respectively.
In the teams’ event, the ‘Stinkin Hot’ team made up of Jenny Henry, Renee Clayton and Rebecca Brown took out first place in one hour, six minutes, with Ariki Adventures’ ‘Last Hoorah’ team of Jennie George, Julie Tamaariki and Helen Philips coming second just 53 seconds later, and the ‘BSPLICIOUS’ team of Shannon Saunders, Tahiti Isaaka and Joyce Fortes taking out third place one minute after that.
Thank you to the committee and to all those who helped with marshalling and water stops and cheering, and also thank you to the Ngati Raina family, as always, for the use of their section.
A big Meitaki Maata goes to our main sponsor BSP and supporting sponsor The Bond Store who provided some fantastic prizes – with everyone getting something for their great efforts. Without our sponsors, these events could not be nearly as fantastic as they are.
Our triathlons continue on Thursday and Saturday afternoons, with the next big race being our annual Club race the Tinman Triathlon to be held on Saturday, April 21, at 2pm. Individuals and teams are welcome for this 1200m swim, 31km cycle and 10km run.

We’re house hunting right now, and it’s soo hard waiting for the right one to come along. There are so many aspects of home ownership that I’m looking forward to… and so many aspects that’re scaring the pants off of me.
Things like knowing what the heck I should do when a water heater decides to rust out and ruin everything in the basement, or what to do about the cutest damn bird that built a nest and invited her entire family into in the dryer exhaust vent. As a renter in these situations, all I had to was hop on the phone and tell the guy we write a fat monthly rent check to, that his house was broken. And then there are the new everyday tasks that’ll be added to our to-do lists. Things like mowing the lawn and shoveling the driveway (though hopefully never simultaneously). And let’s not forget the mortgage that’ll be hanging over our heads for the next couple years rest of our lives.
All of this used to make me think twice about buying a house, but I’ve since done a 180. So why in the heck are we looking forward to home ownership?
Are there financial perks to buying a house instead of renting? I know, as a long-time renter I was asking myself this too. Here’s the biggest realization that made us come to our senses about why buying a house truly is the right thing for us right now:
With a rent check we’re never going to see any of that money again, but with a mortgage payment part of every month’s check will be tallied under our name (ie. added to our metaphorical piggy bank). So when we sell our first house and go to buy the next best thing, this accumulated money will be in our pocket. In other words we’ll be turning our money into a snowballing asset, or in adult speak… we’ll be building equity.
(side note: there are gobs of other financial benefits, as well as drawbacks, to buying a house. It truly depends on you and your current financial situation. HERE‘s a good article weighing the pros and cons if you’re feeling lost.)
We’re going to have a yard! That alone is reason to celebrate. We have this pooch who’s more picky about where he does his business than you probably want to hear about. I can’t wait to be all, “what’s that Koda, you have to pee? Cool I’ll show you the door, have a good time in the blizzard.”
And! Let me throw some jazz hands up for the garden and compost bins we’ll finally have space for! Things like egg shells, produce scraps, and coffee grounds are all biodegradable and great for the soil… but they can’t contribute all these perks to the earth if they’re stuck in a landfill. I cringe every time I throw these organics in the garbage.
Also! We won’t have to share a wall with anyone! We’re currently in a townhouse and share a wall with our neighbors. Granted it is the cutest little house and neighborhood I’ve ever lived in, complete with THIS wine bar and THIS dog treat bakery. So yeah, we’re all going miss having those shops around the corner.
Plus! Uh, can we talk about all the home DIY projects we’ll have at our fingertips? It’s going to be like HGTV and Pinterest had a baby, and out came… our abode.
And! Two words: finished basement. That’s a prereq. Wherever our future basement might be, it doesn’t know what it’s in for. That baby is going to get some heavy duty black-out curtains, surround sound, stadium sofa seating, one of those fancy curved tvs, maybe even a kettle corn cauldron thing in the corner. Or maybe it’ll get a very average tv and our five year old couch. But tomato tomahhto.

Born in Hungary, racing in the United Kingdom. Racing Republic (RR) was set up by Laszlo Janos, former sim racer and currently Senior Race Driver at the RR kart team. Janos initially started online racing in the 1990s, where he gained years of experience in the sim racing community and raced against the likes of WTTC Honda Team driver Norbert Michelisz and Two Times Europen Champion ETRC Tankpool 24 Truck Driver Norbert Kiss.

The HMCL Championship attracted over a hundred participating drivers in the height of the series and Janos met Gyula Gardonyi through the championship. Gardonyi, who has 10+ years experience in karting, specifically in the Senior Rotax Series, helped Janos purchase his first kart in 2015. After two years of testing, Janos set up the Racing Republic Kart Team with seven drivers.

Physicians for Criminal Justice Reform, Inc. (PfCJR), which advocates to eliminate the damaging health consequences that can result from negative interactions with the criminal justice system, has officially partnered with Campaign for Youth Justice, a national initiative focused entirely on ending the practice of prosecuting, sentencing, and incarcerating youth under the age of 18 in the adult criminal justice system.
(DECATUR – March 9, 2016) – Physicians for Criminal Justice Reform, Inc. (PfCJR) is pleased to support advocacy efforts of the Campaign for Youth Justice by officially partnering to lend the collective voice of our physician members to the national initiative to end the prosecution, sentencing and incarceration of youth under the age of 18 in the adult criminal justice system. Medical literature reflects that adolescent brains are developmentally different from those of adults, often leading to impulsive decision-making, increased risk-taking and decreased appreciation for longterm consequences of behaviors. As a result, youth, by law, are prohibited from taking on major adult responsibilities such as voting, jury duty and military service. It follows, then, that youth should not be held to an adult standard of accountability when involved with the criminal justice system. Furthermore, youth in adult jails and prisons are more likely to be sexually assaulted, physically assaulted and, upon release, are more likely to re-offend than youth housed in juvenile facilities. Each of those experiences, as well as early developmental experiences that put youth and adolescents at risk for involvement with the criminal justice system, result in long-lasting, negative physical and mental health consequences that could be avoided by juvenile justice reform that identifies and diverts at-risk youth. Osvaldo Gaytan, M.D., Ph.D., Director of Physicians for Criminal Justice Reform’s Juvenile Justice Taskforce and a physician with specialties in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Neuropharmacology and early childhood trauma states “Children and adolescents are our future. I think we can all agree on that. As doctors, it is our duty to make a united stand against environmental factors that affect both the mental and physical health outcomes of our patients. Every bit of evidence we have as physicians points to the fact that adolescent brains do not function in an equal capacity as adult brains. Therefore, it is not scientifically sound to equate the functioning of an adolescent brain with that of an adult. It is unjust.” Please join Physicians for Criminal Justice Reform and the Campaign for Youth Justice on insisting that the legal age for being treated as an adult be raised to 18 years of age as a national standard. About PfCJR: Physicians for Criminal Justice Reform, Inc. (PfCJR) was founded by a group of physicians who were struck by the myriad of ways that negative encounters with the criminal justice system lead to detrimental health consequences. We firmly believe that changing the interaction between the criminal justice system and individuals of targeted populations will ultimately lead to improved health of targeted communities.

Coinbase Hires Former AWS and Microsoft Employee Tim Wagner as New VP of Engineering — CoinBoom — cryptonews camp
Former Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft employee Tim Wagner has joined Coinbase as vice president (VP) of engineering, according to a blogpost August 6.
Wagner will now lead Coinbase’s engineering team, which is “central to [Coinbase’s] mission of creating an open financial system for the world,” Coinbase writes in the post.
Aiming to build the “most open, secure, and accessible financial system,” Wagner will also be responsible for expanding the team by hiring engineering talent in San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, according to his LinkedIn profile.
Prior to Coinbase, Wagner served as general manager (GM) at AWS for more than five years, with his most recent positions at AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and AWS Serverless App Repository.
Before AWS, Wagner spent several years at Microsoft, serving as the director of development at Microsoft’s Visual Studio Ultimate.
San Francisco-based crypto exchange and wallet Coinbase has also recently hired Wall Street exec Jeff Horowitz as its new Chief Compliance Officer, and Rachel Horowitz, who previously served at Twitter and Facebook as a communications expert, as the new VP of Communications.
Last week, Coinbase announced it started exploring the listing of 49 new assets on its custodial service, including storage for such cryptocurrencies as Ripple (XRP), EOS, Monero (XMR), VeChain (VEN), Cardano (ADA), Bitcoin Gold (BTG), and Telegram.

We’ve just got back from a fantastic long weekend South of the border, where we were staying for a few days attending a family wedding. The wedding was actually on the Monday so we travelled down on the Saturday with the intention of making a mini break of it. As Saturday was mainly travelling we wanted to make sure that Sunday was a day we could spend having some fun as a family and just around the corner from where we were staying for the first couple of nights was the lovely Marwell Zoologocal Park.
Situated on the edge of the South Downs National Park, it’s fair to say that the best way to get there, if you’re using your Sat Nav is not to use Google’s pin for the park – it took us a couple of miles away around the back somewhere. Marwell’s website lists the post code SO21 1JH on their directions page and once established, this got us there no problem. Entrance was £19 for adults and £15 for children over 3 and that included an optional donation to the park to be able to gift aid and help the costs of running such a great place and caring for the animals. No problem and well worth it.
Also on the way in, just through the entrance is the information kiosk, where you can pick up one of the Zoo’s Lost Child stickers. There’s space on it for your mobile phone number – no names please – so that if your little one gets lost at any point you can be contacted and swiftly reunited. We got our boys stickered up but thankfully they weren’t called in to action!
It really is a lovely park, with acres of space for the animals, and your children, to roam – although not together! The pathways are so wide that, even though it was pretty busy, you’re not in danger of hitting any human congestion as you make your way around Marwell’s foot safari.
We’d arrived pretty soon after opening time (10am) so a lot of the paddocks were just coming to life or not quite ready but as we slowly meandered our way around the park we saw penguins, emus, the cheetah (who was still pretty sleepy, lazing under his tree), a few warthogs (cue mum and dad promptly leaping in to a Lion King rendition of “When I was a young wart hoooooooooooog!” and Hakuna Matata!), before we headed indoors to who probably became our universal family favourite of the day – the giraffe’s! It was clearly breakfast time for them when we got there so they were indoors eating, but still awesome to see and be near!
After the giraffe’s we moved onwards, via the land train, just one stop further on to the elusive, and apprently still sleepy, tigers.
There was quite a crowd around the window closest to the sleepy spot so we moved on and the boys sampled their first of the park’s five adventure playgrounds.Situated right near the picnic hall and, as we found out later, the rhino hall, there was plenty of climbing, swinging and sliding to be done here for both our boys, although it was much more suitable for NJ.
After playing here for a little while we headed across to the park’s main eating and watering hole, Café Graze. It’s fair to say that around lunch time it get’s pretty busy and hectic inside here. Luckily we had guessed that and got there before 12 noon. We found a nice spot on a table outside behind the café, with the boys having one of the children’s lunchboxes, Helen had a chicken noodle concoction and I had some salmon. It was all very nice and reasonably priced.
Moving around the park some more we saw some zebras, meerkats, a snow leopard, a red panda and macacques (one of whom J-Bubb kindly pointed to everyone nearby was in the process of poo-poo!), along with the very beautiful Marwell Hall (rumoured to be the place that Henry VIII married Jane Seymour, as it belonged to her family in the 1500s).
Our final stop, and one that we didn’t get any photo’s of, was an animal that NJ was very keen to see – the Rhino. Once we’d established where they were (they’d recently moved from their location on the maps) we went and saw them being moved around inside their enclosure before a couple of them ventured outside in to the first part of their paddock. This is a great paddock too as there is a safari truck that is used as a viewing platform, for which both our boys loved jumping in and pretending to drive around.
As this was our final spot to see we wandered back around towards the exit, noticing that a lot of the quieter paddocks were now full and it was a lovely opportunity to take our time and enjoy seeing the animals one final time. We even called in to say good bye to the beautiful giraffes before heading home after a really great dayt.
Zoos often get a bad rap, but there are quite a few wildlife park’s springing up now, like Marwell and Yorkshire Wildlife Park back home, that are creating a great experience for visitors, with wide open spaces for the animals and great landscapes for visitors. to marvel at. We had a lovely time here, Marwell is truly a lovely park and if you’re in the area, well worth a visit.
What’s your favourite Zoo/Wildlife park? HAve any of you been to Marwell before, if so what did you think?

The SizeGenetics penis enhancer is regarded to extend size A lot a lot quicker than other units that you can buy
: where by prospects received inexpensive plastic produced-in-China elements that may not maintain together. Loads of these can be found on eBay. Usually do not BUY Individuals, Unless of course you've an extra $thirty to blow, 30 days to look ahead to it to ship, and a number of other hours of disappointment wanting to put this factor jointly and keep without having slipping off. Do not forget that on eBay, the images will not be like the true unit you will get.
The SizeGenetics is usually a traction machine that attaches to The top of your respective penis and evenly stretches it absent out of your overall body for prolonged periods of time. This eventually triggers a process called cell division and forces your penis to develop for a longer time. The SizeGenetics is backed by medical experiments and is prescribed to sufferers with Peyronie’s illness (curvature of the penis) and also to These who want to boost the length in their penis.
There was in no way a degree at which I discovered the gadget uncomfortable to use. In the event you read about how penis extenders perform, you’ll figure out that the tension results in micro-tears. The body repairs the tears by including length.
My title is Justin Corey, And that i are actually correct in which you are, seeking a strategy to experience a tiny bit much better about myself by finding a penis enlargement solution that truly is effective.
Use the extender for at least several months (as many as a year if you keep looking at enhancements). I'd say you ought to give helpful resources it four or five months on the minimum amount. Lots of fellas say they see enhancements as many as a yr.
You should definitely look at the online video at the top of this short article for my comprehensive Guidelines regarding how to dress in the gadget, how to extend the product, and my Recommendations on how to use it.
But In case you have the money now, it is extremely advisable that you simply receive the Highly developed Convenience or Ultimate System, considering that It will probably be more cost-effective In the end. Allow me to share the most noteworthy extras that you're going to get:
i basically bought a penis extender every week in the past(SizeGenetics), i use it every day for approximately five-6 hrs. but ordinarily 2 several hours in, i have a need to mastorbate, can it be Safe and sound to remove the penis extender and mastorbate with out influencing the development?
Consider handbook physical exercises for sixty to ninety days and preserve the best Frame of mind to accomplishing the program continuously. Should you’re just beginning, get it done frivolously In case you have concern of getting accidents…then progressively increase the depth.
The final calendar year has long been pretty a journey for me – I started out out being an insecure person with minimal self-esteem resulting from my tiny penis size and obesity. Now a single yr afterwards I've dropped 35lbs. of pure Excess fat and I my penis size has gone from barely five inches to a tiny bit above six inches. All of it started out final new yr (2015) when I decided to change my existence and acquire my shit collectively.
This really is what inferior merchandise post their clientele with, and that is undoubtedly anything SizeGenetics Continue Reading can assist prevent.
I must say, I am so upset with this particular solution. The DVD with Guidance did not function, the many Guidelines are extremely tricky to be familiar with, plus the products isn't really comfortable.
What if I told you that the real secret to horsemanship is a tiny fact. Could it really be a simple thing, after all, there is a whole industry trying to help you develop your horsemanship....is there something they are leaving out?
To those words, I would reply..yes, horsemanship is a simple thing, so simple in fact, you probably have never really thought about it.
All of us want a great bond with our horses, but many times, we fail to communicate on a horse's level of understanding. We often hear how we want to have our horse, be our partner. Well, that is in error, we don't want a partnership, a partnership would imply that our horse has a 50% part of our relationship. The wisest horsemen/women, instead refer to this relationship as a "team" A team has something a partnership does not. A team has a clear leader. A partnership implies that each member has an equal share in the matter...look at it this way. When you come to a fork in the road, do you let your horse decide which way to go? If he is a partner, then he should have a say in deciding which path to take...but if you are a team, the team leader would decide which path to take....am I making sense yet?
So, My horse and I are a team. How can we advance our relationship? One of my favorite things to help my horse see me as the team leader is to let my horse hand graze. Simple enough, I take them out of their pasture, pen, stall, whatever, and let them eat grass....very simple indeed! but did you know there is a proper way to hand graze, and doing it the wrong way can make your horse think he is in charge of your whole relationship?
Hand grazing is done alot here on our farm. We seem to have lots of spots with good grass, and no access to those spots for the horses..I just enjoy hand grazing my horse, and I like to start my youngsters in this exercise as early as they are weaned. To be a leader and to correctly hand graze, you must lead the team. You must move the horse to you, not let him eat and wander wiley niley all over the place dragging you behind. IF you set the rules for hand grazing ( you must follow me horse, I make the plans here ) hand grazing becomes a bonding tool. If you let the horse decide which area to move to next, with no regard for you, you will find out quickly that all other commands you ask of your horse, will be ignored, or at least argued with.
Hand grazing is a tool we can all use, any horse, any age, any place ( as long as there is grass ;-) Next time you take out your horse, let him/her hand graze and practice being in the team captain role...you will be amazed at the difference it makes in your horsemanship!
Earlier this week, we delivered *C-C Handsome Dark Knight to his new owner. "Darkie" is a long yearling gelding, sired by our former ranch stallion "*Shadow's Hawk Spirit" aka "HeartBreaker" ...( he stands in Canada now ) .....out of DKH Black Sage, a mare we lost to colic when Darkie was just a week old. Darkie joins a mare we sold these folks a while back, and will grow up to be a stellar trail horse. He is pictured with his Dam, the black mare, and his adopted Mom, the white pony, and a head shot from last winter....
Here at Creekside, we have often delivered horses to their new owners. If it is a reasonable mileage trip, we often do our own hauling, it saves the buyer a heap of money, and is VERY good customer service. We planned this haul for a weather break, and felt comfortable with our trip plans.....the only thing I can say is....Don't trust the weatherman !!!
We left home before daylight, and a few miles into our trip it was apparent it would not be an easy haul. 60+ MPH winds beat on us the first 100 miles...the 2 nd 100 miles we had icy roads and snow, snow and MORE snow.....
We actually arrived just a couple hours late to our destination....Darkie hauled well, and was anxious to see other equines at his new home. His owner put him in with a 3 month old orphan BLM filly...with a real attitude..she marched right up to Darkie, stomped a foot, turn and kicked at him and did all sorts of funny dance moves to show her dominance....Darkie just smiled ;-) he is used to "little" bossy girls....LOL...when we lost his Dam, we were fortunate to find a nurse mare for him..an 11 hand pony! He has also been exposed to all the 2010 babies since they were born, and Darkie is a very gentle soul, not a mean bone in his body...I can not wait to find out how long it takes for the two of them to be roughhousing and grooming each other.
So, there is yet another curly in an awesome home, that will be used and well loved ;-) The gentleman that bought him considers Darkie his "own" and is looking forward to the journey of youngsterhood, to finished horse.
The trip home made the trip there look easy...boy, semi trucks look alot bigger when they are on their side......we made an unplanned stop for the night...after 14 hours of driving, we were just worn out. We arrived home the next day, that drive as about as impressive as the rest of the trip had been. We later found out, the road closed behind us ....and traffic stood still for hours...I often hum to ease the stress of winter driving...everything I can think of, "Blue Skies", "White Christmas" such things...after we passed the semi wreck and the stalled, jackknifed semis, I turned my humming to hymns, something along the line of "To God be the Glory" my moto for our safe trip in a world of really bad weather.
But...all in all, a successful, though stressful trip, and a curly in a home that will cherish and grow him up...nothing better for a curly horse breeder!

The Special Education program emphasizes preparation for consultative and teaching roles in public and private K-12 educational settings. The program provides knowledge, theory, and practice in the development and education of children with intellectual impairments, learning disabilities, behavioral, speech and language difficulties, and related areas of need.
While not required, it is expected that students will come to the program with solid preparation in early childhood, elementary and/or secondary education. Students will be prepared to act in consultative roles and to foster inclusion of children with special needs within the general curriculum in both private and public schools. The program has existing partnerships with the Catholic schools of the Archdiocese of Washington, the public schools of both the District of Columbia and Prince George's County in Maryland, and several specialty and charter schools, which provide a variety of choices for practical experiences. Students who are currently certified to teach and who successfully complete the program should be eligible for special education certification in the District of Columbia and, by reciprocity, in most other jurisdictions. Students who do not currently hold any teaching certificate may require more course work than is listed below in order to obtain a special education certificate but may become eligible for certification by completing our special education program. The Catholic University of America does not itself grant certification; this is a prerogative of the state in which one plans to teach.
Program Requirements for the Master of Arts Degree (M.A.) and the Graduate Teacher Certification Program (GTCP)
CUA's program in Special Education offers graduate students the opportunity to complete a licensure program through our Master of Arts degree (M.A.) or Graduate Teacher Certification Program (GTCP). The M.A. has a standard requirement of 36 credit hours, the GTCP requires 30 credit hours.
Students in the special education program are expected to develop expertise in assessment and cognitive learning strategies, as well as skills in fostering and managing change in school environments, advocating for children with special needs, and consulting and supporting parents and other teachers. Students are encouraged to approach their study and future work reflectively, considering the instructional, ethical, empathic, interpretative, and practical dimensions and consequences of their behaviors. The special education program at The Catholic University of America is designed to lead students from a child-focused to a system-focused perspective.
University policy permits the transfer of up to 6 credit hours of previous graduate work into the program with the approval of the student's academic advisor and the Dean of the School of Arts & Sciences. In addition, the Department of Education normally will consider for transfer only credits earned in the five-year period immediately preceding the student's admission to the University and for which the student earned a grade of "B" or better. Older graduate work will be reviewed for its continued currency in the field of education. Transfer credits to replace EDUC 525, EDUC 699, and EDUC 702 are not usually allowed.
Two Research Papers are required for the M.A. in Special Education. One research paper is written in EDUC 699: Introduction to Educational Research and the second research paper in EDUC 702: Advanced Foundations of Education.
The Research Papers are scholarly, comprehensive literature review papers on an approved topic. Each paper must be at least 20 pages in length and include at least 20 scholarly references. The professor of record for the course will grade the papers. Students must receive a grade of B or better in order for the paper to satisfy the requirement. Students who receive a grade lower than B on the paper will have the option of working with the professor of the course to improve the paper to meet the requirement of a B grade.
Completed papers must be approved by the course instructor and by the Department Chair. They indicate their approval by signing the Research Paper Form, which includes an abstract of the paper. Approval signatures are due at the completion of the term in which the course is taken.
Special Education candidates are required to complete three field experiences, which ordinarily occur during the summers: the first field experience occurs in the summer term following the first term of coursework; the second and third field experiences occur in the second and final summer semester. Together, the three field experiences and course fieldwork total 500 hours.
Candidates' teaching practices are observed and evaluated by University supervisors. The overall evaluation of student teaching is conducted twice; the initial observation occurs during EDUC 532: Modification and Adaptation of Curriculum and instruction of the Exceptional Individual. The final observation occurs in the final field experience during EDUC 534: Field Experience: Collaboration, Consultation and the Process of Change. The Midterm evaluation is a formative assessment conducted by the University supervisor, the student's cooperating teacher and the student (three-way assessment). During this three-way assessment, goals for improvement of the student's performance are developed. The final evaluation is a summative, three-way evaluation of overall student teaching performance with input from the candidate, cooperating teacher and university supervisor.

Specialise in Play Therapy BSocSci (Hons) Psychology (UP); MDIAC Play Therapy (UNISA) I studied BSocSci Psychology and BSocSci (Hons) Psychology at the University of Pretoria. In 2003 I received an invitation to join the Golden Key International Honour Society. I was awarded a postgraduate bursary by the University of Pretoria to further my studies in 2005. I decided to specialise in Play Therapy and furthered my studies at the University of South Africa where I obtained the MDIAC degree, with the dissertation on ‘Siblings of children with cancer’s experience in the family dynamics after treatment’. I am currently practicing as a play therapist, working with children two years and older with a variety of emotional and behavioural problems due to e.g. divorce, bullying, low self-esteem, as well as children in the health care system. A great deal of my work requires me to provide parental guidance and to support parents and educators in raising happy and well-balanced children. As a member of the board of the ‘Association for the Education and Care of Young Children’ (AECYC), I work closely with other therapists in the field of early childhood development and support nursery schools and -educators on the psychosocial needs of the children. I volunteer my services to Operation Smile South Africa where I am a credentialed Child Life Therapists through Operation Smile International. I accompany Operation Smile from time to time on medical missions internationally and locally where I prepare the children emotionally for their operation and attend to their psychosocial needs. I have a passion for working with children, parents, and professionals in the field of education and psycho-social care of children.

My wellness journey started in Zimbabwe after taking a course in Executive Certificate in Workplace Safety and Health Management under Workplace HIV/AIDS Support Programme offered by University of Zimbabwe in 2007, which opened me to the impact of health-related issues in the workplace. After completing my Environmental Health degree with Solusi University in 2009, I worked as Information and Communications Officer at a local HIV/AIDS non-governmental organization and it was during this period that I learned of the burden of communicable and non-communicable disease globally. In 2011 I was appointed Safety and Health Officer at a plastic manufacturing company and during my tenure, I witnessed untimely deaths of two colleagues due to chronic disease complications. I felt compelled to contribute in transforming the traditional system of health care. Due to economic malaise in Zimbabwe, I lost my job at the end of the year, though disappointed this gave me an opportunity to transform healthcare. With two of my friends from University, we opened a wellness consulting firm with the objective of transforming the landscape of healthcare in Africa. In 2012 I was working alone consulting and writing wellness articles for Barclays, Econet Wireless, CBZ, and other companies which had a high number of sedentary employees. Our company initiated Wellness Cluster Meetings which offered an opportunity to discuss and learn wellness programs from other peers in the industry. Around this time I partnered with Wellness Africa (South Africa) and was later trained in 2013 as a Certified Wellness Coordinator. During that visit to South Africa, I learned of wellness programs offered by Discovery Vitality and realized to make sustainable health behavior change globally it was imperative to settle in South Africa and reach a global market. By the beginning of 2014, I was offered an opportunity to work in South Africa, which I grabbed without hesitation. Where to start now? Whilst in Zimbabwe I had applied to be trained Health Economics by World Bank Institute and in February 2014 I received a positive response and went on to enroll in the course. Beginning of 2015 I studied Innovating in Healthcare with Harvard Business School which was an eye opener on the business side of healthcare. By end of August, I had become part of the Vitality Wellness Network for Discovery Vitality after finishing a course in Advanced Certificate in Workplace Wellness which opened a new door to the application of behavioural economics in wellness programmes. Currently, I work as a Wellness Consultant with Blue Ocean Healthcare, which provides behavioural wellness consulting services for medical aid schemes, brokers, hospitals and companies in South Africa and Zimbabwe.
Freelance Content Marketer with an interest in education, organisational culture, and personal development In 2012, I obtained BA Dramatic Arts Honours degree from Wits University. I have also completed several Online Marketing courses, including a Content Marketing course through the University of Stellenbosch, for which I was the top student for 2015. I have always had a curiosity about the world around me and believe I will never stop learning. This has ignited my interest in a variety of areas including, but not limited to, education, personal development, and organizational culture. With experience in media, public relations and content marketing, I approach my work with a theoretical sentiment combined with a creative edge. With regards to education, I have a particular interest in early childhood development, particularly sexual health as well as how we prepared our kids are for the outside world once they leave school. One of my key driving forces is to add value and inspire those I meet to achieve what they desire most.
I am primarily a registered nurse by profession since 1982. In 1999 I started specializing in Occupational Health where the emphasis shifted from pure patient care to employee health and wellbeing. In 2009 I started working for the University of Pretoria where I established an Occupational Health Centre for employees where all employees are subjected to a medical surveillance program depending on the occupational hazards and risks they are exposed to during the course of their work life. Being part of the academic environment, I enrolled as a student in 2012 and completed a B Cur I et A with majors in Nursing Education, Nursing Administration and Industrial Psychology in 2014. Throughout my professional life, it became second nature to educate people regarding health issues in order to ensure an optimal state of health and wellbeing within larger communities. It is extremely satisfying to empower people with the relevant information, knowledge, and tools to be able to make responsible choices and take care of their own health, as well as emergency situations they may encounter. This platform gives me the ideal opportunity to involve a larger population with my effort. I am very grateful to MOMENTUM HEALTH for the opportunity to do so. And hope to contribute even more in future.

Occupational therapist with special interest in Ayres Sensory Integration and Neurodevelopmental Therapy
I completed my B. Occupational Therapy degree in 2005 at the University of the Free State. Following my community service year, I joined a dynamic multidisciplinary team of therapists at a rehabilitation hospital but realised in August 2008 that I needed to follow my childhood dream, working with children. This led to the opening of my own private practice, on a part-time basis at first, in 2009. Since May 2010 I have been working closely with other occupational therapists, psychologists and speech therapists and now form part of the multidisciplinary team based at Therapeace. Learning more about the newest developments in the paediatric field has always been one of my priorities. As a result, I qualified as a sensory integration therapist in 2011 and as a neuro-developmental therapist in 2013. I am also trained in Therapeutic Listening, Tomatis® method, and Interactive Metronome. I am therefore writing about occupational therapy, the different frames of treatment as well as interesting topics that parents ask me about in private practice. By researching and writing up, I not only plough back into the community but also enrich myself. I am passionate about children and will give my best to benefit each child that crosses my pathway. I believe that teamwork is the key to developing children and this team includes the parents as an integral part of the team.

I am a communications consultant with the experience of working in public relations agencies, on various clients in the areas of technology, finance and corporate social investment. I’m a strong advocate for the use of technology in areas of education. I also believe that children need to be equipped with adequate knowledge to understand the effects of technology and social media in their everyday lives as well as their futures, while being able to participate in a world that requires them to use technology. In recent years, I have worked as a freelance writer on various platforms, having started as a technology writer and gadget reviewer, now branching out into lifestyle orientated pieces as well as specific researched topics that I am asked to write on.
I write under the name of Paulus Pilatus for The Sunday Times, largely because, being an advertising man, writing under my own name would be conceived as commercial self-promotion. No youngster, I have been in recruitment advertising industry almost since inception and remain in the industry as CEO of an agency that writes and places recruitment, education and tender advertising. Qualified by experience alone, my focus is and always has been on good recruitment advertising and the role it plays in the careers and development of the youth of tomorrow and the path they choose to follow. Parents read job ads with their children in mind and a good advert clearly outline future opportunities, particularly in the critical skills arena. With the noticeable move from hard press advertising, my present focus is attracting the attention of young and old, in a job advertising context, given the speed with which they surf internet, be it in a social or news-search context.

Monique is the founder of Children4Conservation and the Youth Leader of 1,000,000 Footprints to Save Africa Campaign. This campaign aims to afford all children, irrespective of nationality, creed, colour or status, the opportunity to realise that their voices are powerful and capable of fuelling change and transformative action. The 1,000,000 Footprints to Save Africa Campaign is an awareness raising and education program earmarked for the youth of Africa and the world. The Campaign visits schools, places of learning and any other location where youth gather with an interactive presentation aimed at making aware and educating the youth on the current environmental issues facing Africa, focusing on the endangered species and, in particular, the rhino. The youth are then encouraged to take a pledge to spread the word, be aware, and become an advocate for the youth by placing their footprints down on lengths of cloth in a SYMBOLIC WALK for the world to see – a peaceful protest against the continued exploitation and destruction of Africa’s natural resources. Monique placed 3rd in the International Young Eco-Hero Award 2015. The U.S. Embassy in Hanoi invited her to speak at the WildFest Gala Evening which took place in Hanoi in October 2015 and to visit and speak to scholars of 10 schools in Hanoi during the week leading up to the Fest. This was all in aid of Operation Game Change aimed at initiating a downward trend in the consumption and sales of endangered species in Hanoi including the purchasing and consumption of Rhino Horn.

Mind Moves® is an intervention movement programme aimed at children from 6 – 18 years, removing barriers to learning that can hamper children’s cognitive development, diminishing their confidence and leaving them feeling anxious and confused. WHAT IS MIND MOVES Mind Moves programmes focus on weaknesses on a physical developmental level, due to underdeveloped sensory-motor wiring, causing learning barriers like ADD/ADHD, Dyslexia, Tactile Defensiveness, Problems with Math, Delayed Language development, Poor Listening or Visual skills, Poor Pencil grip and Writing skills, Low Muscle tone, Anxiety disorders, Poor Balance, Poor Exam and Test writing skills, etc. Mind Moves are scientifically-proven exercises that successfully remove these barriers by building strong pathways between the senses, brain, and muscles, freeing a child to develop naturally; and continued use of Mind Moves nurtures excellence in learning throughout school and life. Mind Moves are easy, fun movements and can easily be performed at home. WHAT WE DO At Mind Moves we address barriers to learning and recommend tailor-made programmes, by assessing children 1:1 to get to the root of the problem of learning barriers. We also establish preferred learning styles and Mind Dynamix® Dominance Profiles to reveal dominant learning strengths; find out why children struggle to learn and what holds them back in school; learn what steps to take and help them to become academic achievers, improve their marks and succeed at school. Our services also include:
Study fitness programmes, providing the tools for top academic achievement in one great package to master children’s strengths to taste success, build self-confidence and develop emotional maturity. This programme also strengthens underdeveloped areas, to overcome unnecessary obstacles in their daily life. School readiness assessments including a Mind Moves solution that strengthens your child’s brain from the very first day and helps them to excel at school up until matric.

I have been in the adult learning environment for more than 15 years, am a qualified ODETEP (Occupational Directed Education Training and Development Practices), facilitator and life coach, I’ve made it my personal mission to create moments where people can experience powerful ‘AHA’ moments. It is my passion to facilitate learning that has an impact and has the potential to change lives. To empower people to be all they are capable of, helping them unlock their true potential and transforming it into results are some of the most satisfying experiences I’ve had. More importantly, I am also a mom of two beautiful boys aged 4 and 2 and have the unique opportunity to be a stepmom to a 12-year-old in a reconstructed family. When I first attended the Parent Efficiency Training (P.E.T) workshop, the entire time spent was a series of great AHA moments. I underwent a life-changing experience and felt empowered to unlock my true potential as a parent! It was impossible to imagine not sharing these phenomenal discoveries and insights with everyone I know. I had to become part of this team. I feel as if I’ve been preparing my entire life to live this purpose of giving parents power tools to develop emotionally intelligent children who will ultimately help change the world and make it a better place – one child, one family at a time. One of my favourite quotes by Marianne Williamson, also used by Mandela in his Inauguration speech is: “Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.” We can sow the seeds. With the right nurturing and care, we can experience the joy and exhilaration of seeing the grass growing and the flowers blooming.g.
I completed my BSc Ed degree at the then Rand Afrikaans University (RAU), now known as the University of Johannesburg(UJ). I was always passionate about education and became a Mathematics and Science teacher at Hoërskool Roodepoort from 1994 - 2000. Whilst being an educator I still continued offering extra Maths classes at my home and other venues from 2000 to today. In 2000 I embarked on a new journey as a Medical Representative for a Pharmaceutical Company and this provided me with invaluable sales experience. I was appointed PAMA South Africa (Pan Asian Mathematics Association) President in 2010.This appointment enable students to participate annually at the PAMA Abacus and Mental Arithmetic Competitions around the world. This year we are taking 43 students to represent South Africa in USA. Previous year we competed in India, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Hong Kong . In 2015, my company, SEMAS SA, trading as A+Students was awarded ISDF (Institute of Soroban Diffusion Foundation) membership. This membership enables us to take a group of A+Students student to an annual Soroban camp in Tokyo, Japan. This year will be our second attendance at the camp with 20 South African students. A+Students also scooped the ROCCI Roodepoort Chamber of Commerce and Industry) Small Business of year 2013 award and in 2014 the Educational Business of Year runner up. My greatest motivation for starting Soroban Education was the fact that I, as a matric Maths & Science teacher, witnessed first-hand how matriculants were struggling with Differentiation and many other Mathematical topics. Not because they don’t understand Differentiation for example, they do, but in the process of completing, showing the steps when they solve the problem, they lose most marks because they cannot add, subtract, multiply and divide. In 2005, I saw an insert on Carte Blanche where 5 year old Japanese children were doing the most amazing sums adding, subtracting dividing and multiplying large numbers in seconds, mentally. I did not sleep for days and I eventually found Soroban Education and that was the start of our journey. Since then A+Students has participated in 7 international competitions. We have met the Science minister from Thailand and our sojourns into Asia cannot ever be measured. We have grown from just a handful of international participants to huge groups. We have gone from bronze medals and now we can even boast with gold and this was won competing against the best mathematicians in the world.
I started teaching in 2004 while still studying. After completing my Education degree at the University of Johannesburg in 2006, I took a special interest in psychology. I went on to complete my Honours and Masters degree at the University of Pretoria and qualified as an Educational Psychologist in 2009. I remained in the schooling system with my role changing from educator to school psychologist where I got the opportunity to address a lot of the issues I saw in the classroom on an individual basis. In addition, I also entered private practice and qualified as a BabyGym instructor in 2009. My focus was on developmental classes with moms and their babies, the prevention of learning difficulties, learning difficulties, emotional difficulties, career guidance, accommodations/concessions and school readiness. I especially enjoyed giving parents guidance as I felt that the parent’s role in the intervention process was crucial for success. The fact that parents often felt left in the dark with regards to their children’s therapy or the education system, sparked this interest on even further. Demystifying educational and developmental issues one parent at a time was very satisfying, doing it on a platform that could potentially reach millions of parents by writing about these topics is exhilarating.
My name is Marene Jooste. I am married and the mother of 2 beautiful boys. I have completed a 3-year degree in Human Movement Science and obtained an Honours Degree as well as a Masters Degree in Kinderkinetics. With God’s grace (and very hard work), I graduated all 3 degrees with distinction and was selected as Kinderkineticist of the Year. I am also a member of the Golden Key International Honor Society and currently serve on the board of SAPIK (the South African Professional Institute for Kinderkinetics) as one of 2 vice-presidents. After my studies, I worked at Botje & Billson Optometrists to help children improve their functional (binocular) as well as their visual-perceptual skills. In those 3 years, I have furthered my training with regards to eye muscle control and the impact it has on a child’s ability to read, learn and write. In 2008 I founded Kwanda Kinetics. This innovative centre is dedicated to providing high-quality programs and services to improve physical fitness, promote healthy living and develop neuro-motor skills crucial for future scholastic achievement. We currently have 5 Kinderkinetici as part of the Kwanda family and they are all contracted as in-house Kinderkinetici at about 20 schools in the Westrand of Gauteng. In the afternoons, we provide full neuro-motoric assessments, adapted physical programs as well as reading therapy sessions (being a Wise Eye Reading Agent). I have presented numerous workshops to more than 500 teachers in the past few years, and are passionate about educating and serving the local community. I am also an Integrated Learning Practitioner as well as a SNAP tutor for autistic children. Our centre works in conjunction with numerous professionals including but not limited to nutritionists, behavioural optometrists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, rheumatologists, podiatrists, paediatricians, and neurologists. Our centre is also honoured to have recently partnered with the University of Johannesburg to do more research about children's development. I am a firm believer in the holistic outlook of a child's development and thus our centre approaches learning from this point of view. I am passionate about what I do and believe that this is one of my callings in life – to love, cherish and develop the most precious thing in the Kingdom of God – children.

“Motherhood has taught me the meaning of living in the moment and being at peace. Children don’t think about yesterday, and they don’t think about tomorrow. They just exist in the moment.”
—Jessalyn Gilsi I trust that by sharing our experience, more parents will realize that having a special needs child is not a death sentence, but rather the beginning of an unknown, yet very inspiring road ahead.

I love reading and writing. I’m a mother, writer, and teacher, with two boys: William, a young teenager, and Alexander, a tall 9-year-old. My husband Steve is an audio and sound-systems specialist. I have taught English at a local high school, tutored high school students, and written for textbooks and study guides. I still write and tutor, and write worksheets for English at ONCE, a subscription service for high schools. When I read, I enjoy taking notes; and then I pass those on to you! When I need to know something, I read a lot and find people with experience in the topic: ADD, teenagers, gifted children, boundaries for kids, and much more. I look forward to sharing the parenting/education journey with you!
I studied LLB at Pretoria University, I completed my studies in 2005. In 2006 I started with my articles at a law firm in Johannesburg. After completion of my two years of articles I was admitted as an attorney in the Transvaal High Court. During 2008 I was a law lecturer at Varsity College in Sandton, this is where I realized that I wanted to work more with people and especially babies and children. We relocated to George and when I was expecting my first baby I knew that my passion for babies and children was much greater that my passion for law. I qualified as a BabyGym instructor at the end of 2010. BabyGym gave me the knowledge and opportunity to work with the most precious gift….children. I really enjoy working with babies, but I wanted to be able to help older children, this is where Mind Moves came in. During 2012 and 2013 I completed my Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) through UNISA. I am excited about the chance that I have to assist children of all ages with challenges they face. I enjoy researching and writing about all aspects of child development and particularly how physical movement can development and improve children of all ages and with various challenges.

Frank closed this business in July 1994 when it became difficult to balance his studies at Wits University and his business. Frank graduated from Wits University in 1996 with a BSc in Mathematical Sciences and Mathematical Statistics. He went on to earn a first class BSc (Hons) in Advanced Mathematics of Finance from the same institution. In 2002, Frank completed a first class MSc in Financial Mathematics at the University of Pretoria. His dissertation was titled “Modelling Default-Risky Bonds” and he examined the structural and reduced-form models used to value default-risky bonds. In 2008, Frank qualified as a Chartered Alternative Investment Analyst (CAIA), in 2010 he qualified as a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), in 2011 he completed the Advanced Postgraduate Diploma in Financial Planning with the University of the Free State and in July 2012, he qualified as a Certified Financial Risk Manager (FRM). In October 2013, Frank completed the Advanced Management Program at the Harvard Business School. Frank believes that there is no skill more crucial to the success of a leader, the leadership of a nation and its prosperity than reading. He believes that successful leaders make reading an indispensable part of improving their personal and professional life. One of Frank's favourite quotes is attributed to Henry S.Trurman: "Not all readers are leaders, but all leaders are readers."
Estelle is a passionate teacher and mother who want to make school easier through the education material she develops. The saying is that education is in your blood. In my case, this is literally so. I grew up in a teacher-family. My mom was a part-time teacher and my dad - a brilliant Mathematics teacher and Headmaster of a High School. My mom often reminisces about how I as a young child used to teach an imaginary class and how I couldn’t wait to go to school. In High School, our house was often a tutor centre, where I explained mathematics to my fellow school mates around the dining room table. I guess it was inevitable that my life journey would take me to many classrooms and teaching opportunities. I went on to study education at the North West University. I did a BA degree, majoring in English and Mathematics and then went on to do my Higher Education Diploma. And the teaching didn’t stop here. When my first child was in Grade 4 in an IEB school, I realised that not all children are naturally equipped for the demands of IEB assessments. While knowledge is important, the real acid test and ethos of IEB assessments is how a child is able to use and apply said knowledge to make inferences and re-use it in other creative ways. I searched online for study materials to help my child practice these skills, but found very little with South African content. I then designed my own mock test papers for my child, which later extended to my friends’ children and saw that it definitely made a difference. The papers introduced them to other ways of questioning and helped stimulate higher order thinking. It also gave them confidence when writing tests as they knew what to expect. Four years later, StudyChamp is the realisation of my dream: An educational website with the main purpose of making school easier (and more fun) for children.
Paediatric Clinical Psychologist & founder of the Trinity Triad of Creating, The Accelerator, and the Power Life series
Dr. Pieter Kitshoff is a Clinical Psychologist who is passionate about developing confidence in children and adults and gives a lot back through research and community service. After receiving his PhD in psychology at the University of Stellenbosch in 1983, he completed his post-doctoral fellowship at Brown University (USA), and qualified as a Child Development Specialist and Paediatric Clinical Psychologist. On his return to South Africa, he started his own private practice as a clinical psychologist. He left his practice in 2012, and founded the Creating Opportunity Group, Inc. Since then he has been doing extensive research of the causal factors on the skills in maximizing life in adults and embracing confidence in children. From this research, the Power Life- Chasing Your Dream and Amazing Confident Kids (ACK) programs were born. Recently he has founded the Centre for Motivation and Change and the Creative Arts Youth Centre. Both these Centres have as its main focus the discovering and creating of one’s optimal potential. For young adults, the online program series ACCELERATOR has its focus on the enhancement of ultimate determination, self-discipline, and commitment to success. In the case of the ACK teacher and parent programs, the mechanism of creative art, nature photography and moral storytelling are applied with the focus on developing self-esteem and confidence skills in children. Pieter is also a qualified primary school teacher. He has developed the ITM program where the focus is on critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision making. This is being presented mainly in the Corporate Business environment. He also delivers Teacher Training courses with the emphasis on Applied Behavioural Analysis and assistance of children with special educational needs. Pieter is a qualified Dementia and Alzheimer management specialist. He has received a few awards of which the Paul Harris International Rotary award for outstanding community services is his humble pride. Pieter’s hobbies range from seashell art to the making of bird call flageolets and his lifestyle embraces personal fitness.
Some call her approach to child development rather unusual, but it is exactly this novel and fun approach that makes her a respected leader in the field of child development. Melodie’s education has been broad and diverse, ranging from a B.Prim.Ed (RAU) in 1982, a B.Ed Psych (RAU) 1985, M.Ed Psych (RAU) 1993 on maths and science learning readiness to D.Phil (RAU) 2005. Despite all her formal studies Melodie is quick to point out that most of her studies actually happened at home learning from her three children, Ruan, Waldo and Cozette, and the hundreds of children and babies she worked with in her private practice. In 2005 Melodie founded the BabyGym® Institute and in 2007 the Mind Moves® Institute. She is actively involved in both Institutes promoting the importance of physical development to optimise brain and whole child/person development. In 2005 she was nominated by the American Biographical Institute for one of the “Greatest Women of the 21st Century”. In 2007 her BabyGym programme won the DSA: VISIONS OF THE FUTURE award. In 2011 she was nominated for the Shoprite Checkers Women of the Year award in the Educators category. Apart from being the founder of various institute’s, a keynote speaker for many schools, governmental departments and corporates, Melodie is also the published author of 10 books, some of which have been translated into 6 different languages.

Casha Meintjes is a member of the British Association of Behavioural Optometrists and leads a team of Optometrists and Vision Therapists in three of her optometric practices in Johannesburg. Eyetek Optometrists specialise in Behavioural Optometry, a whole-body approach to vision care. Behavioural optometrists understand that the way we interpret what we see does not depend solely on how clear the eyesight is. Behavioural Optometrists will not only consider the treatment of any eyesight difficulties but also the benefits of prevention, protection and enhancement of the visual system in order to improve all aspects of visual performance. The goals of behavioural optometry are to prevent vision problems from developing, to provide treatment for existing vision problems and to develop and enhance the visual skills needed in the classroom, the workplace or when playing sport. Eyetek has a special interest in particular areas of practice such as children’s vision, education, reading and learning difficulties. All practices provide functional vision examinations for patients of all ages as well as multisensory vision therapy through a team of trained therapists. Eyetek also specialises in neuro-optometric examinations and neuro-rehabilitation for patients following stroke and head injury.
In the process of completing a B Com Business Management, the last 3 years I was involved in selling a successful technology business and building an education business. My passion for the education industry, combined with my intrigue for technology solutions, brought about a very unique and innovative product that assists the South African youth of today with critical career decisions. Inadequate career guidance results in learners leaving school with only a vague knowledge of employment opportunities, little insight of career direction and students who undertake a tertiary qualification, irrespective of suitability. The missing link in effective career guidance in South Africa remains the learner/student’s ability to economically, easily and effectively identify a specific field of study and occupation. Online Career Guidance will provide individual career guidance to learner’s based on the career direction that is most suitable to them, with a comprehensive career report and planning tools that guides them into a specific career direction most suited to their ideal career orientation.

The main reason for doing a breast self-exam is to detect breast cancer as early as possible. If caught early, the prognosis is more probable to be a positive one. It is a good idea to get to know what is normal for your breasts. That way, if you observe changes you can check in with your doctor. Of course your breasts may change in size and shape. Breasts can change as a result of where you are in your menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, breastfeeding, with dieting or if you pick up weight.
Examine yourself several days after your menses ends, when your breasts are least likely to be swollen and tender. Make sure to do a breast self-exam once a month. However, a breast self-exam should never replace radiological tests like a mammogram and breast ultrasound.
Stand with your shoulders straight and your arms on your hips. Look at your bare breasts in the mirror in a well-lit room.
Use a firm, smooth touch with the first few finger pads of your hand, keeping the fingers flat and together.
Cover the entire breast from your collarbone to the top of your abdomen and from your armpit to your breastbone.
Feel all the tissue. For the skin and tissue just beneath, use light pressure; for tissue in the middle of your breasts, use medium pressure; for the deep tissue (near the ribcage), use firm pressure.
If you notice any changes, or if you are worried or are in any doubt, then you should consult your doctor. It is better to be safe than sorry.
In addition to the above, if you have breast implants you will be able to feel them and differentiate them from your natural breast tissue.

Facebook, even with its privacy issues, is hugely popular. It’s the number one social media site in all demographics. It boasts 2 billion monthly active users and 1 billion daily active users. Yes, billion with a B. Two billion people around the planet log on to their Facebook profile every month.
To put that in perspective, the International Telecommunication Union estimates about 3.2 billion people are online. That means 2 billion (or roughly two-thirds) of them are self-proclaimed monthly Facebook users.
By now, you likely have a Facebook page for your business. In fact, some businesses don’t even use a webpage, just their Facebook page. While this is tempting to do since it’s easier to attract people in a space where they already are, remember you don’t own the content on your Facebook page. It could disappear overnight.
Still, even with the dangers of non-ownership, Facebook is a sandbox most internet users are playing in. But is a Facebook Group right for your business? Let’s take a look.
Facebook groups can be public, closed, or secret. An open, public group allows anyone who lands on it to read all of the content. With this type of page, there’s less administration since you’re not approving people.
If you choose to make a private or closed group, where people must be reviewed before receiving access to content, you have the option of asking them questions before approving membership. The group will be visible in search but to post and view content, people will need to be members.
There is no absolute right answer but here are a few questions that can help you decide whether you’re ready for the commitment of a Facebook group.
Do you have the time? A Facebook page requires regular posting and commenting but a Facebook group needs that plus an accelerant. It’s nice to have interaction on your page. It’s essential to have it in your group. Are you ready for the commitment to planting and cultivating interaction in your group?
Do you have people to tend to administrative tasks? Even if you make it public, you’ll need at least one person to ensure everyone plays nice and adheres to your rules. (You’ll also need someone to come up with those rules). If members don’t follow the rules, you’ll need to boot people out.
Do you have a business need? This is the hardest one to decide. A business need could be a need around your audience, not one you have specifically. Let’s say you sell nursing equipment and accessories for new moms. Your target demographic may have a real need to connect with others who are going through the same challenges. Or maybe you have a craft store and a Facebook group could serve as a place for those to share their craft projects. A CPA may offer a group to allow people to ask tax questions. Businesses that offer niche products or services are well-suited for groups.
Are people interested in interacting with you? Do you have a large fan base or is your business brand something people get excited about? It doesn’t have to be if you’re filling another need. But if you want to elevate your page interaction and create a group, you need people to interact with you. If they already are, it can be a natural transition.
You can advertise your own services but most people are not on Facebook to be sold to. It’s better to provide value and have them contact you as a hot lead than to use your business group as a microphone for how awesome you are.
Facebook has community standards that include creating a place free from harm, allowing for diverse views, equitable application of its standards, and allows people to report questionable content.
This summer Facebook rolled out a beta feature that allows certain groups to charge a membership fee to join a group. For those who are running the pilot program, the fee is paid through Apple or Android and they get a portion of the membership fee. Will this be available to all business groups at some point? That’s yet to be seen.
Is a Facebook group right for your business? Perhaps, but only if you’re ready for the challenge of administering it. There’s a lot that goes on behind the scenes building community and ensuring your members feel comfortable enough to interact with one another.

The DOBES archive contains audio and video recordings of endangered languages. It is important to understand the principles of access rights in the archive before using the archive. The recorded data is stored as sessions that usually consist of one or more media files and a description of the circumstances of the recording (metadata). Often, an annotation file is present as well where the researches have transcribed and translated what is said, sometimes with additional notes.
Each documentation project in the DoBeS framework has created their own subarchive which in turn has its own structure that usually sorts the sessions according to their topics. This is represented as a tree structure that can be browsed for a first impression.
Two different kinds of searches are possible in the DoBeS archive: The user can search the metadata descriptions (e.g. search for a language, a place of recording, etc.) or the annotations (search for a certain word and find all recordings where this word is included in the transcriptions).
For an exploration of the archive in terms of language of the session, location, participant or other information about the recording session, the metadata descriptions can be searched. By right-clicking on any corpus node (e.g. the top node of the DoBeS archive, the top node of a subproject or the top-node of a subbranch of any archive) and selecting “metadata search” a search can be performed over the metadata descriptions. This is by default an unstructured, google-type search but more complex queries can be entered xxx.
Note that it is not always easy to search for a person, as many participants are anonymized in the archive. If you are searching for recordings of an anonymized person, it would be best to contact the project team for help.
For users who are more interested in finding instances of certain linguistic phenomena (e.g. ergative case), narratives or discussions pertaining to a certain topic (e.g. astronomy, the use of tobacco, …) which is not expected to be contained in the metadata description, it is possible to search the annotation content.
Note however, that the depth and structure of annotation differs widely across projects and within projects across different sessions.

Alyssa Gauthier was a gymnast until 2013, when she quit in search of another sport to keep herself active. After attending a diving camp soon after, Alyssa joined the sport and has loved it ever since. Looking back, Alyssa feels her favourite event was her first national level three metre event, where her result meant she received her first Junior National qualification.
After only two years of diving, Alyssa attended her first Junior Nationals, placing fifth in her age group in the three metre event. Currently, Alyssa continues to persevere, working hard to get better every day. Since beginning diving, she has not only loved the sport itself but the community around it. For her, diving is a way to have fun, stay active, meet new friends and to continually challenge herself.

After four years of trading, which have improved year on year, we have managed to produce a new website which tells our story and sells our wares. We hope you like it.
In addition to the site which will be developing over time, we have incorporated this blog to tell you what we are up to and introduce you to new environmental ideas and services.
This is complemented by our new Twitter, Facebook and Google+ feeds which we hope you will be able to click on and ‘Like’. These feeds will be used by us to offer our thoughts and activity updates, but will be more informal than the blog feed which we are aiming to use as an informative news feed – see our next blog which deals with choosing a boardwalk material.
Our future blog posts will cover all sorts of subjects such as maintenance and lifetime costs of walkways, environmental licensing, pond construction, outdoor education, environmental and biodiversity planning, and water management and assessment. This will, of course, be added to by any other issues which come to our minds as being relevant and informative.
As ever, we have not been twiddling our thumbs and have recently invested heavily in new plant for the construction of walkways, piling and paths including a one off for the UK market – more details to come soon. Additionally, our innovation in environmental construction has not stood still and we are assessing the engineering design of plastic structures and the incorporation of fibre reinforced materials to allow us to build longer lighter spans over ponds and lakes, still using recycled plastic lumber (as they call it in the USA)!
We hope you enjoy reading the blog and continue to visit and look forward to hearing from you as a new or repeat customer in the future. As ever, if you have any queries that you think we might be able to help on – no matter how left field you might think they are – please get in touch via the contact page.

I used to think that reds would only suit those with hourglass-type of body, the bombshell kind, with dark brown or black hair that is curled or just naturally let flow with some big waves - what I would call a perfect woman in terms of appearance. Me, with my chubby cheeks and "this height", barely visible thigh gaps, and not-ready-for-lingerie-yet kind of body, is not ideal to wear red AT ALL.
But guess what? It is now, the color red, of which dominates the two-third part of my whole bullets.
Indeed that according to ancient Chinese belief, red is always associated to joy and happiness. All in red is the best, from wedding decorations to clothing picks at Lunar New Year celebration. But when it comes to our pout polish...
Asian girls mostly can relate, so raise your voice now! I shall stand for all of you, because I have been there too.
Red is definitely, most anticipated lip color for a girl to have. Be it dark brick red or just the bright, fire engine one. I get attacked, until now, if I wear red in full-strength. After few months now they start to appreciate how it looks on me, far better than how they used to be. The question is: HOW?
My BF was once in that team too! He was that kind of typical boy that used to say, "you're prettier without makeup, trust me," and another boring pick-up lines. But today along with my younger brother he can already spot the differences in my red lips: is it Burberry or Illamasqua? They can tell. I don’t lie, they really can.
And today's the day when I will tell you my secret to find the BF approved, (so is family and friends) approved red lips!
This is I believe is the most mistake we all at least, once, made. We usually are drawn to the shade that is the most recommended by everyone, cult favorites, and blogger's picks. Yep you can take notes on those popular shades, but do remember those are BEST ON and FOR THEM, not for or on you. The best way to know which red are going to work on you, is to try each of the possibly different lipstick at counter. Advises are:
1. If you have fair-light skintone, pick the ones that are fairly bright to medium red in the color range.
3. If you have dark skintone, dark to vampy reds will likely to appear more true red on your lips than the brighter one.
Why? The intensity of the color is what matters. Easy logic here, dark reds will definitely appear a lot darker, bordering vampy/goth on fairer skintone. If you're fair or light, say around NC10-15, medium to dark red is your best pick if you want your very own deeper red shade. However if you're dark like around NC42 and up, medium red will likely to appear bright and happy on you. Then the bright reds? They will appear much brighter and even neon maybe, and "not-so-red" on you-might be orange/pink instead! Got it already?
Now about the undertone. This is the most trusted and popular and used method in picking the best red. Basically, everyone looks good in any red as long as it's red. What's important is to pick any shade that has stronger red tone in comparison to other color element (orange/pink/brown/blue) in it. Thus it shall turn out red on you, despite what undertone your skintone and your lipstick has. What's about the undertone (warmer/cooler) is that it matters to the impression you wanna create!
For example, warmer skin with strong yellow undertone would look great with blue-based red for classy look, but orange or brick red would look good for everyday wear.
☆ Pick the color that's not too neon or eye-searingly bright so it doesn't attack your undertone back, making you look weird.
A boring, a should've-been-a-conclusion-kind of tip, but this is my main idea of wearing red lipstick and of this post. What's the point of wearing even the most famous red shade, if you're not confident or feeling great in it? You won't look like living it, others will notice too! You don't wanna embarrass yourself and that gorgeous lip color do you? Red is never wrong, your pick is. There will be time, darling, to get used with the red you never get along well before. Key is: be confident in it.
Balance here means not every highlighted feature or point of your look is screaming for attention. Smokey and red lips, why not? If you want a heavier eye makeup, don't pick burning red color, get a tamed one, for example. Basic instruction, but vital indeed!
Brows. Brows. Brows. Beautiful red color is now painted perfectly on your lips along with the eye makeup and blusher. Yay! But what is a beautiful painting—without a great frame, it would be just be another unfinished work. Brows are your face's frame. Do it perfect: be it bold, thin, arched, straight, anything but NOT sparse or undone. This is important, brows are the wow factor of the look and great God-given balancing properties of upper and lower part of your face. If it's not perfect yet, it's your time now to make it be!
Whoever said red is only for ladies, I do agree wholeheartedly. It's only for the brave. A lady can be cute or seductive, it's all up to her as long as she lives it well! Pick the red according to the style you wanna live by its intensity. For my very own style, I love making red lips cute on me so that I can embrace and enhance my naturally chubby cheeks with it. For sultry and professional look, darker red would be perfect.
It's the method of application and the color of blusher that you should change depends on style of the day and the red! Best blushing tricks are varying from one face shape to another (let's talk more about it next time) but go try different tricks to fit it with the lips and look. Skip bolder blush, let’s just get them natural this time, kay? The most favorite blush application method of me is making the cheeks appear like if blushing from the inside. Straight-application method. This method works great to give younger effect to plus I don't contour my face when I use this method. Embracing youthfulness (?)
I love how red can be very versatile: a morning stain-on-the-cup, daytime professional wear, or sexy lady of the night. From Audrey Hepburn to Rita Ora. It rocks in every wayw but never screams the same vibe for each person except one: the truth of one’s strong personality inside. You can be an angel, a mother, a devil, and even a Lady just with a swipe of red lipstick. Don’t be shy, you will get to nowhere if you’re afraid to try new things (and reds as well). Red doesn’t have to scream sexy, it can scream playfulness and send energetic youth vibes also.
I hope this post helps you to take one step ahead out of your comfort zone! And tell me: What’s your BF-approved red lipstick and what’s your favorite? Share your looks in red lips with hashtag #BFapprovedRED on Instagram, would love to see your photos! Spread the love and kiss them red. XOXO~~!
P.S: Quick survey! Do you think I should share my red lipstick collections to all of you? I have more than 10 bullets, for sure...let me know if you want me to do a post and swatches for comparison. Yay for red!

So far, the experience has been profound. I’m feeling a need on some level to do some crazy exercise to shake it all up and get back into my past default in questing for muscular strength. However, having just received a second 1:1 hands on session of Body Mind Centering, from the lead trainer Katy Dymoke, I’m just going to continue to lay on the floor and be with the tangled mess which is my inner body.. This beautifully sweet training, and supporting body work is helping me to unwind the world of pain felt in my body which; I had surrendered to needing to endure forever, now I’m not so sure.
It’s a crying shame that despite the amount of yoga and Pilates sessions I’ve received that there isn’t more of this information present. I have just 2 teachers in each discipline whom teach from this perspective. THIS is what it’s all about, not your abs, your yoga selfies or your legs a kimbo!.. I’m so exhausted, in a good way, hence why this is the only thing I’ve managed to publish through out my so far 2 weeks Somatics training, but more is coming! Watch this space ..
It’s not just you dear organs, fluids and glands, whom cope with digestion, procreation and feeling..
The challenges facing fixed and mobile Internet providers are distinctly different from those faced by enterprises or other large organisations. The network itself is vastly different in terms of scale, trust and operational restrictions; the users have different demands and expectations, and the mix of traffic is much more diverse. Only products and solutions designed exclusively for service providers can hope to effectively address the real-life complexities that they face.
Sandvine is dedicated to offering solutions that increase network profitability, while improving the experience for the subscriber. The platform on which these solutions are delivered is the Sandvine Policy Traffic Switch (PTS), a powerful traffic inspection and network policy control device that provides the tools necessary for network operators to achieve a wide range of business objectives across multiple functional teams.
Deploying a new service or traffic optimisation policy should be a simple step. Service providers are interested in delivering new subscriber services without worrying about the behind-the-scenes network element configuration required to do so. This can be done in a simplified service creation with the Sandvine Service Definition Manager.
Sandvine allows service providers to rapidly create, edit and deploy service policies across all of the Sandvine elements in their network. Regardless of the operational goal, the implementation is consistent. Whether the objective is to alleviate network congestion, create defenses against malicious network traffic or mark traffic for specialised handling by other network elements, the process is the same.
Once the service policy is created, the final step is to deploy it to the network. Deployment pushes the policies to the associated elements after which the policies begin to actively work with the traffic on your network.
Implementation of new services is done with Standards-based Network Policy Control. Subscribers are demanding more from the online environment. Regardless of devices chosen, location of the end user, or time-of-day, there is a collective expectation for reliable access to the applications with which subscribers have become inseparable.
Sandvine's Service Delivery Engine is a single, access-agnostic platform that manages service delivery according to flexibly-configured, customised policies that take user entitlements, network conditions and traffic type into account. The result is dynamic bandwidth control on a per-user, per-application basis for services like video streaming, interactive gaming and VoIP.
