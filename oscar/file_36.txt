From there, each class can use the standard Active filter by default, or can override the definition of Active. Foreclosure might look like this:
This enables all classes to leverage the generic "Search" statement, while tweaking it's WHERE clause for class-specific purposes. Importantly, if we change the generic "Search" statement in Abstract.config, all classes leveraging this will inherit this change, but retain their customized definition of "Active".
Pre-defining {Where.Active} in the Search statement does not meet all use cases, however. Examples include:
With such a filter, the following URL will limit results to ImportForm records that are part of workflow with ID 2401:
The presence of the ImportForm.ImportFormID clause may contribute to parameter sniffing, causing the SQL optimizer to choose an execution plan that works well with the presents of an @InDecisionID parameter, but poorly without one. By including this clause dynamically with a filter, a different optimization plan is guaranteed for the query with and without the @InDecisionID parameter.
When building complex WHERE clauses, it is preferable to build statements with {Where.Basic} and several parameter-based filters, to a single complex statement that handles the same parameters that may be NULL.
If you have multiple environments (DEV, UAT, PROD, etc.) You can publish configuration data between the different sites.

It might be cold outside, but that only gives us lots of reasons to play more indoors. Here at MaXXX we find that this time of year has lots of couples buying up big on things like massage oils and candles, specialty lubricants and little tips and tricks to extend fun in the bedroom on long cold nights.
Besides a little slap and tickle, or perhaps a bit of light bondage, there is one area of play you may have not explored before – temperature play.
Temperature changes stimulate and excite nerves. When outside influences stay the same, your nerves relax and can become desensitised — they know what’s coming, nothing is changing, so they go to low power. If you stimulate the nerves by changing temperature, they stay awakeand, therefore, increase the power of your sexual play.
By experimenting with different degrees of touch and temperature, you will expose your body to a variety of thrilling physical reactions that you haven’t felt before. These diverse sensations dramatically increase arousal, heighten skin sensitivity, and release pleasure-fueling endorphins.”
Why it works:Adding heat to the right spots on your lover’s bod will actually boost their sensitivity to touch. Applying warmth raises thermal temperature, causing blood flow to increase, which, in turn, makes skin more receptive to stimulation. And a little heat goes a long way.Mind-blowing moves: Fire up your sack sessions by breathing new life into foreplay…literally. When you blow on their skin, your warm breath creates a change in temperature, which heightens arousal,” says Stella Resnick, PhD, author of The Pleasure Zone. Simply let your parted lips linger over the more sensitive spots, like their stomach, ears or neck, and gently exhale. Juliana, 23, swears this technique is not all hot air. “My guy actually quivers whenever I blow on his earlobes and nipples while we’re fooling around,” she says. “He always tells me he gets such a rush when I do that.”
If you want to bring your partner to the boiling point, try this hot-water trick. Put a warm — not scalding — cup of H2O by the bed. Before you go down, take a sip to get your mouth nice and toasty, and swallow. Then take another small sip, but this time hold on to the liquid as you take them in your mouth, swish the water around for a few seconds and then swallow. If any of it spills , just lick it off; we promise, your lover won’t mind one little bit.
Besides special lubricants that can heat up and cool down you can also try using massage candles for some safe hot wax play. Unlike traditional candles, massage candles (like those from LELO, right) are usually made from soy wax, and are designed to melt the wax so that it’s warm enough to pour and spread, but not so hot that it will burn or mark.
Use it for massage or to tease your partner with a drop or two from a height – either way you’ll both be a little ‘hotter’.
TIP: Pour some of the wax into a plastic baster and microwave for a few seconds. Then you cna use the baster to drop little beads of hot wax onto their body, spell out naughty words or create a trail for your partner to follow on your body. (is just as much fun with some massage oil hated up).
Hotter Than Hot: If all of this sounds fun, but not quite enough, then turn your naughty thoughts to the world of adult toys – and especially the ones that can fit into your temperature play fantasies.
Glass: Glass dildos, dilettes and plugs have been around for decades. But only in the last 5 years or so have they truly become gorgeous play things. Made from super-strong materials, and often infused with precious metals for lustrous colour, a glass piece can be mildly heated and cooled simply with a glass of water bu the bed.
Metal: Think shiny. Really shiny. Hand-polished stainless steel, gold and silver sex toys are all in-vogue at the moment. Super-safe, easily cleaned, but more importantly – metal toys (steel especially) will hold their heat for even longer than glass. So you have even more time to figure out the best place to play with them. Just like glass, there is a toy for pretty much everyone, from petite beads to the incredible Njoy Eleven.
And I’m not talking about those times at the pub doing obnoxious a-capella renditions of Bohemian Rhapsody at the top of my lungs whilst playing air guitar and standing on the pool table. On a school night.
Silly me. Yep, six months of swanning around, blissfully declaring that I had found “My Soul Mate”…. only to wake up one morning, roll over and think, “Really? YOU? I thought YOU were my SOUL MATE?!?!” before running from the building at full speed, half-dressed, screaming in terror and wearing only one shoe.
Then there were the times of knowing, deep within, that this time I actually had found my Soul Mate, like really-really-actually-for-real-this-time. The electricity. The intense passion. The sublime spiritual connection. And at the root of all this, the certainty that the feeling was mutual.
You know that moment when the world crumbles around you as you lie bloodied and broken, heart shattered on the floor?
These moments of heartbreak and disillusionment send us into limbo. Some days we curse the day we fell for the soul mate myth. What a crock. “Soul mates are for gullible wimps and they’re not even real anyway,” we say. “I’m gonna be a player. I’m gonna leave a trail of broken hearts. Once I’ve eaten this entire pack of Tim Tams.”
Other days we might call our best friend and wail through the phone, “The soul mate IS SO real and my one dumped me, I’ll NEVER leave the house again!”
It becomes apparent that, in order to restore our faith in humanity, we must find another soul mate to fill the void and end the suffering.
So we go out looking for The One. We search ALL the bars. ALL the clubs. We roam the streets. Every cute shop assistant is a potential soul mate. And after quite a few uninspiring dates and at least three bit-of-a-shocker hookups, we start to get really down. “Why can’t I find my soul mate? What’s wrong with all these people? Maybe it’s just me? Why am I not good enough? Am I destined to walk this earth alone forever? I’m so ugly…”
If so – well, I read a book recently which was really helpful. It’s called The No Excuses Guide To Soul Mates by Stacey DeMarco and Jade Sky.
This book explained a lot for me. So get this – according to DeMarco and Sky, Soul Mates do exist. But not in the traditional sense. For instance, it’s not like there’s only One Perfect Match for you in your whole life and if you screw that up, well you might as well be dead. There’s more than one type of soul mate. Some are platonic, some are romantic, some are very physical, some are more spiritual. Even our teachers, family, or best friends can be a type of life-changing soul mate, and we attract them into our lives at different times depending on where we’re at – in that moment.
Something clicked for me as I read this book. I could actually look at each soul-mate-type and relate it to my own relationships and experiences. Suddenly these feelings of having found The One didn’t seem so misguided and foolish. Those people were special to me for a reason. Sure, they would be wrong for me now. But for me then, they were…the One.
DeMarco and Sky show you how to detox from a bad relationship and move on, build your personal power, break destructive patterns, and make dating FUN again. It’s a very heartwarming, empowering, and comforting book.
If you’ve ever had any kind of doubts, guilt, embarassment or bewilderment about any of your ex-“Soul Mates” – don’t beat yourself up, give this book a read. It might just give you some closure.

With our northern neighbours soaking up the sunshine (and rubbing it in our collective televisual faces) and our own weather managing more frosty than frisky, our thoughts naturally turn to that tropical getaway, or a spot of travel in a warmer, northern cliamate. What with international travel prices so low at the moment now is a perfect time to plan a naughty holiday. Cities from London to Tokyo to New Orleans have erotic scenes beyond your wildest dreams, just waiting to be tapped by pleasure-seekers.
In addition to booking your flight, choosing a hotel, and getting romantic restaurant recommendations, investigate where to go in cultivating your carnal side vis–à–vis local culture. Check out annual guides that are published exclusively on everything sex-related to a city, like Paris Sexy, getting leads on titillations like…
Kick off your holiday with some R&R, namely a decadent, sensual massage. Such spa treatment will help to reconnect you with your body, getting you in a sexy state of mind and helping you to relax (a much needed component of eventually getting sexually revved!). Enjoy, too, being buffed and bathed with a hot soak, scrub down, or steam bath. This is your time to leave your regular life behind (at least temporarily) and prime yourselves for pure eroticism.
Sexual enhancement boutiques can range from the high-end to the trashy, depending on the mood you’re in. Whether you want a store resembling a modern art gallery or like the lewd, equip yourselves with an array of intimate private time products. Leisurely browse impressive assortments of for-your-pleasure delights like vibrators, hand-blown dildos, sensual massage lotions, French ticklers, satin cuffs (with matching mask), custom-made crops or whips, erotic games… Don’t forget to pick up sensual bath and body products for some post-sex action as well, as you’re sure to have worked up a sweat in testing out your new toys!
Lose yourselves in collections of erotic art, graphic novels, racy photographs, pornographic comics, adult-only reading and DVD selections, lewd postcards… you get the picture.
Lingerie boutiques: Whether buying for yourself or for your sweetie, indulge yourselves in ensembles of ‘barely there’s.’ Not only will such shopping make you feel sexier, you’ll feel naughtier as your fingers graze lacy G-strings and garter belts, as you choose a form-fitting velvet or leather corset, or as you slip on some sexy black seamed stockings, a sheer, babydoll teddy, or the infamous maid costume.
For those feeling bold enough to shop for fetishwear, check out local collections of latex lingerie, costumes, boots, and vinyl bustiers, amongst other props, for satisfying your fixations. Top off your purchase with some killer stilettos, a feather boa, or wig, but not before inquiring about any upcoming events or fetish parties the shop might be discreetly hosting or know about.
Cabarets & Burlesque shows: For those not into “raunch”, but hoping to soothe their need for the sensual, mesmerizing cabarets and burlesque shows can do just the trick. Offering a range of deliveries, from the sassy to the shocking, these art forms play with the power of suggestion via dance, storytelling, and parody, with the burlesque possibly offering partial striptease. Other sensually-focused entertainment experiences can include a city’s ballet, theatre, or opera performances (love that drama).
In the end, your vacation is all abut YOU and the person you travel with. It can be as relaxing, sultry, sexy, or dirty as you want it to be.
Just remember to check local laws regarding adult entertainment, alcohol and drugs, and even sex toys if you’re travelling outside of Europe or North America. Plus you should always remember to be stocked up on lubricant and condoms if you’re planning on playing with multiple partners – it’s not only responsible, it’s essential.
From clinical experience, I’ve found that clients in committed, long-term relationships often present in my counselling room with complaints relating to reduced, low or non-existent sexual desire. And it is not uncommon that clients present after years of conflict regarding one partner’s sexual desire and/or availability.
But before we get started it is important to understand exactly what Sex Therapists are talking about when we refer to “sexual desire”. To keep it plain and simple sexual desire can be understood in a couple of ways. The first and most common understanding suggests that sexual desire is an innate biological drive that motivates individuals to seek out sexual stimuli or activity. Many of can relate to this of course; it’s those times when you say to yourself “I just want sex!” The second interpretation sees sexual desire as an external force that manifests in the potential partner rather than from an internal need within the desiring self. In my own experience with clients, I’ve found that people can show both innate and external desire and this can occur interchangeably within their relationships.
So why do people struggle with sexual desire? What are the causes? It is important to acknowledge that there can be multiple physical, medical, psychological, emotional and social factors contributing to this phenomenon.
You may have heard friends, family, colleagues or even strangers talking about why their mojo just won’t show. These may have been factors such as long working days, exhaustion, children, lack of privacy in the family home, relationship problems such as anger at the other partner, or a significant life event, communication problems, substance abuse, anxiety and depression, illness, certain medications, prior sexual abuse, gynaecological problems or even a primary medical problem such as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD). And while this seems like a long list, it is by no means exhaustive. Unresolved problems relating to sexual desire can prove catastrophic to both the sexual and non-sexual relationship in long-term relationships. In a situation where people might be feeling strain in their relationship, this may be a good time to see a health practitioner that can assist and offer support.
Sex therapists use a number of techniques that can be used to address sexual desire issues. General education about the anatomy and physiology of the body and sexual techniques can be very helpful when people have limited or no knowledge about. We also give our clients sensual touch homework exercises involving touching, caressing and non-coital massage. Who would have thought homework could be so much fun? The aim of the game is to help couples recapture their sexual intimacy and work towards rebuilding that physical connection that may have been neglected due to any problems that may have arisen in the relationship. Communication! Communication! Communication! You guessed it, being able to communicate and negotiate our needs and wants, both sexually and more generally within the context of the relationship is also important as an influencing factor in upping “that thang”.
It is important to remember that working with sexual issues also involves working with relationships. Sexual and relationship issues can exist on their own. However, relationship problems can cause sexual problems and sexual problems can cause relationship problems and is not always easy to know the links between relationship and sexual problems.
The information discussed in this article offers some brief information and a few simple suggestions about how I work with low sexual desire. But one size does not fit all and each individual and/or couple will no doubt benefit from an individualised and client centered consultation with a qualified and experienced Sex Therapist and/or Relationship Counsellor.

There’s a wise old saying about spiritual and personal growth: first there is the mountain, then there is no mountain, then there is the mountain again.
What this means is that you have normality, then that disappears while you grow and experience the opposite, and then it comes back again as you integrate the two. But it’s not the same reality, it might look the same but the experience of it is quite different.
At first we do standard sex, which generally means focusing on the physical, generally in our heads. You’ll have heard me describe this in various ways: the performance model of sex, the adolescent male masterbatory model of sex. This is level one sex, where you focus on the ‘peaks’ of sex, the ‘bigger-harder-faster’. Level one sex is about technique, sexual excitation and explosive orgasms. This is the mountain you start with.
Then you realise that this type of sex is not entirely satisfying, there has to be more. So you start to explore a deeper approach to sex. You may find that you are attracted to Tantra, with its mindful approach to love-making. You find yourselves slowing down, taking time to connect and to build eroticism. This is level two love-making. This is where you become aware of the ‘valleys’ of sex, where the sensual and subtle create feelings of ecstacy. This is where the mountain disappears, sex is not what it was.
Then the mountain reappears as you combine both the peaks and valleys of sex. But these are not the same peaks you knew before you discovered the valleys. These are peaks of sexual intensity that come with great presence and connection. You swing between the peaks of sexual intensity and the valleys of sexual bliss, in a flow of love-making that has no plan or expectation. This is stage three lovemaking, and it is truly awesome.
Would you like to learn more about second level love-making and even move on to third level one-making? Then book in to my Tantra Fusion Workshops, or have private sex therapy and/or Tantra sessions.
No doubt that today, being Valentine’s Day, will see millions of couples step out for a luxurious, or intimate, or purely romantic dinner. So it’s the perfect day to present Part 2 of our super sex foods. (You can read part one here)
Did you know that men who consume at least 200 milligrams of vitamin C a day improve their sperm counts and motility? In fact Vitamin C has even been shown to be effective in reversing infertility in some men (University of Texas) in as little as 14 days.
And while you’re in the grocer don’t forget the Watermelon. It’s filled with high concentrations of the good-for-your-heart, good-for-sex phytonutrients lycopene, beta carotene, and, the big one, citrulline. Citrulline is particularly exciting for its ability to relax blood vessels, according to studies at Texas A&M University. When you eat watermelon, the citrulline is converted to the helpful amino acid arginine. Arginine boosts nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels, the same basic effect that Viagra has, to treat erectile dysfunction and maybe even prevent it.
Alot of people are going to like this one. Italian researchers recently found that the antioxidants and alcohol in the wine may trigger the production of nitric oxide in the blood, which helps artery walls to relax, increasing blood flow to the genitals. Just limit yourselves to a glass or two. More alcohol than that can put a damper on sexual performance and lead to bed spins of a not-very-sexy nature. Worth noting: even teetotalers can benefit from the red grape. Dark grape juice contains antioxidant polyphenols that protect the cardiovascular system and help keep skin flexible and elastic.
Which brings us to red meat. Lean cuts are great sources of zinc, a mineral that curbs production of a hormone called prolactin, which at high levels can cause sexual dysfunction, according to Berman. Zinc is also a key muscle-building nutrient, and the high concentrations of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) in beef, studies show, may spur weight loss. Choose filet mignon or other deep red cuts with round or loin in the name, because they are the leanest.
Protein is so important to weight maintenance that you should eat it with every meal and snack. Proteins boost metabolism a little more during digestion than any other type of food. Plus protein increases metabolism by helping to build muscle and stall the muscle loss that naturally happens as we age. Muscle is more metabolically active than fat is, so the more lean muscle on your body the better at burning calories it will be. Plus, well-toned abs and thighs are nice to look at when unadorned by clothing. So, how do you eat more protein without going overboard on eggs and meat? Beans—they’re good for the heart and your glutes. Kidneys, garbanzos, black beans, and navy beans are full of muscle-building protein.
While they may not be the best choice for a side dish if you plan on sex for dessert, building your meal plan around a foundation of beans and legumes will ultimately pay off for you sexually. Many studies show that bean eaters are leaner and healthier than people who don’t eat beans. According to one study in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, people who eat 3/4 cup beans or legumes a day have lower blood pressure and smaller waists than people who get their protein from meat. Beans are also full of cholesterol-lowering soluble fiber. A quarter cup of red kidney beans delivers 3 grams of fiber, plus more than 6,000 disease-fighting antioxidants. Navy beans are particularly rich in potassium, which regulates blood pressure and heart contractions, something you’ll need as your heart starts racing when he does that special move that makes you melt.
Well, to be more specific – fatty fish. If what’s good for your heart is good for your love life, then fish like salmon, mackerel, sardines and tuna should feature regularly in your meals.
The omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA found in fish help to raise dopamine levels in the brain that trigger arousal, according to sexologist Yvonne K. Fulbright, PhD. Other health benefits: anti-inflammatory properties that fight blood clots and heart arrhythmias, better brain function, and protection against dementia. Studies show that omega-3s can also reduce symptoms of depression. Research from the University of Pittsburgh showed that people with high omega-3 blood levels were happier and more agreeable. Tell us that can’t help you get more sex!
Fish is one of the many healthy foods that contain the amino acid L-arginine, which stimulates the release of growth hormone among other substances and is converted into nitric oxide in the body. It’s worth repeating: nitric oxide is critical for erections and it can help women’s sexual function as well by causing blood vessels to open wider for improved blood flow.
Did you know a bowl of Uncle Tobys’ finest is one of the few ways to boost testosterone in the bloodstream?
The male hormone plays a significant role in sex drive and orgasm strength in both men and women. Oats (as well as seeds, ginseng, nuts, dairy, and green vegetables) contain L-arginine, an amino acid that enhances the effect nitric oxide has on reducing blood vessel stiffness. L-arginine has been used to treat erectile dysfunction. Like Viagra, it helps relax muscles around blood vessels in the penis. When they dilate, blood flow increases so a man can maintain an erection.
Oatmeal and other whole grains like whole-grain bread, brown rice, and barley also qualify as good-for-the-heart, better-for-the-gut foods. They are slow-burning, complex carbohydrates that won’t drive your blood sugar through the roof. They keep you feeling fuller longer and provide excellent energy. Try a bowl of steel-cut oatmeal with fresh berries and bananas with a drizzle of honey before your next marathon sex session.
Oysters have long held their reputation as an aphrodisiac (though that is historically attributed to their shape and visual appeal), however raw oysters do have a strong connection to sexual function.
Oysters hold more zinc than most any other food, and it is believed that this mineral may enhance libido by helping with testosterone production–higher levels of the hormone are linked to an increase in desire. Zinc is also crucial to healthy sperm production and blood circulation. While Casanova reportedly ate 50 raw oysters a day, about six will provide double the recommended daily allowance of 15 mg of zinc.
To spice things up a bit, try a few dashes of hot sauce on your raw oysters. Other good sources of zinc are shrimp, red meat, pumpkin seeds, poultry and pork, eggs, and dairy products.
No matter what you’re serving, make it healthy, yummy and sensual – and remember, food does more than set the mood, it’s also vital to the way we want to play.
I’m often asked what’s the difference between sex therapy and coaching, and where Tantra fits in. So here goes…
In a nutshell, Sex Therapy fixes sexual dysfunctions to make people sexually functional. Sex (and Relationship) Coaching, takes functional people and makes them exceptional. As I do both, I can help you fix the problems, and then take you beyond – far beyond – into the realm of exceptional! That’s where the Tantra comes in.
Sex Therapy is a modality of sexual healing to help people with sexual dysfunctions become sexually functional. This involves addressing the psychological barriers to sexual health and well-being as well as providing sexual education and correction of limiting or false beliefs around sex and sexuality. Once healing has occurred, Sex Coaching can then take the individual or client to greater sexual awareness and fulfillment.
Sex Coaching is pathway for sexual growth. Sex Coaching is a client-focused approach that works with sexually functional individuals and couples to enable them to deepen and expand their experience of sex, love and intimacy. Depending on the needs of the client, it may include ancient and esoteric teachings (see Tantra Teaching), sex education and instruction. The Coach helps the client to discover and enhance their own eroticism to create a love life that is one of ongoing growth and fulfillment.
Relationship coaching is a professional client-focused service where an essentially functional individual or couple is guided to create their desired relationship with effective support and information. The Coach enables the client(s) to become clear about their needs, hopes and desires, and to develop understandings and strategies to achieve these in a mutually supportive way. While past hurts and history may be addressed, the focus is more on moving forward, with the aim of enabling ongoing personal and relationship growth.
Tantra is a spiritual and energetic approach to sex and life that comes from ancient India. Along with the Taoists of China and Qidosha from North America, these approaches to sex, love and intimacy are much broader and deeper than conventional western understandings. Through practices that include breathing, mindfulness, moving energy and sensual touch, you will learn to connect with your partner is a way that is real, deep, erotic, poetic and intensely beautiful. Tantra sessions do not involve nudity or intimate touch – that’s the homework!

Sexologists, cardiologists, and psychologists agree: how much you consume has a huge impact on your sexual health. Exactly what you eat is important, too. The right foods can help us transform the way we feel, and the way we feel is central to how healthy our libido is.
So here are the 12 foods you should be getting more of if you want to get more of ‘it’. Part 2 next week.
Researchers at the University of Rochester conducted experiments on undergraduate students to see if there was any real connection between the color and sex. In one, male and female students viewed images of women on red or white backgrounds. The men found a woman’s image on red more attractive than on white, while the female students did not. In another test, men were asked to rate attractiveness of pictures of women on red, white, gray, green, or blue backgrounds. As expected, the men scored the women on red as more sexually attractive. They also said they would spend more money on the women in red than on those in the other colors.
Strawberries can be considered sexy for another reason besides their sensual color: they are high in the B vitamin folate that helps prevent birth defects, and vitamin C, a potential libido booster. Strawberries dipped in melted dark chocolate anyone? Or how about the classic strawberries and whipped cream? Blueberries (and blackberries) are just as sexy. Ideal for a great morning-after breakfast in bed, so you have energy for round 2, both berries contain compounds that are thought to relax blood vessels and improve circulation for a natural Viagra-like effect.
Spinach is a potent source of magnesium, which helps dilate blood vessels, according to Japanese researchers. Better blood flow to the genitals, as you’ve learned, creates greater arousal for men and women. Spinach and other green vegetables like broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, cabbage, Swiss chard, and bok choy are also good sources of our favorite sex nutrient—folate.
Extra insurance for good reproductive health, folate may lower blood levels of a harmful substance called homocysteine. This abrasive amino acid irritates the lining of arteries and encourages plaque to adhere to it. A high level of homocysteine is a significant risk factor for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). But it appears that dietary folate is protective. In a study of 46,000 men. Harvard University researchers found that those who consumed the most folate daily were 30 percent less likely to develop PAD (Peripheral Arterial Disease) than men who ate the fewest folate-rich foods.
The antioxidant catechin found in tea promotes blood flow all over the body for sex power and brainpower; it enhances memory, mood, and focus.
One particularly potent catechin, a compound called ECGC prevalent in green tea, is thought to increase fat burn. A study in the Journal of Nutrition found that people who consumed the equivalent of three to five cups of green tea a day for 12 weeks experienced nearly a 5 percent reduction in bodyweight. Drink freshly brewed green or black tea every day-hot or iced. Bottled teas don’t offer the same benefits. And keep the sugar out of it.
Unsweetened tea is an excellent alternative to high-calorie, sugar-laden soft drinks and juices. One 12-ounce can of soda has about 10 teaspoons of sugar in it. The western world is drinking itself into obesity! The high-fructose corn syrup in many soft drinks raises insulin levels, which can over time develop into diabetes. Studies also show that getting too much sugar lowers the body’s ability to produce endorphins. Low endorphins can lead to depression, and know that depression sucks the life out of our sex drive.
Pumpkin and sunflower seeds, almonds, peanuts, walnuts, and other nuts all contain the necessary monounsaturated fats with which your body creates cholesterol—and your sex hormones need that cholesterol to work properly. That’s something the ancient Romans didn’t know when they tossed walnuts at newlyweds for good breeding luck.
Long linked to fertility—the shell, of course, resembles a man’s cojones; the inside meat is vulvalike in form—nuts make a perfectly sexy snack. Packed with muscle-building protein and filling fiber, they are a heart-healthy, albeit calorie-dense, treat.
Over easy, hard-boiled, or scrambled, eggs aren’t the most sensual food on the menu, but it’s hard to beat them for a fit and healthy body inside and out. Eggs are rich in vitamins B6 and B5, which help balance hormone levels and ease stress, and are important for a healthy libido.
Calorie for calorie, eggs deliver more biologically usable protein (if you eat the yolks) than any other food, including beef. Eggs are an excellent part of a weight-loss strategy thanks to their protein and B12, a vitamin that studies have shown is necessary for breaking down fat.
One study in the International Journal of Obesity found that when overweight people ate two eggs or a bagel for breakfast 5 days a week for 8 weeks, those who ate the eggs lost 65 percent more weight (and lost it faster) than the bagel eaters.
Devouring something gooey and decadent is incredibly sensual. Dark chocolate, in particular, contains a compound called phenylethylamine that releases the same endorphins triggered by sex, and increases the feelings of attraction between two people, according to research published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association. In fact, brain scans in a British study showed that eating chocolate causes a more intense and longer brainbuzz than kissing does. In this study researchers monitored the brains and heart rates of couples while they kissed passionately or ate chocolate. The brains of both men and women showed greater stimulation while the chocolate melted on their tongues than when their tongues were tied in a passionate kiss.
What’s the “healthiest” chocolate? The disease-fighting flavonols that make dark chocolate good for the body also cause the bitterness. To balance flavor and health benefits, try dark chocolate with 70 percent cacao, recommends Jeffrey Blumberg, PhD, who directs the Antioxidants Research Laboratory at Tufts University A 2-inch square chunk, at about 100 calories, will deliver a healthy treat without messing with your weight-management efforts.
So there you have it. I’ll tell you about 6 more super foods next week, but until then remember, you can eat your way to better sex!
Christina Spaccavento is one of MB’s community network members and she is a brilliant therapist. Recently she contributed to an article in NewsLifeMedia’s Body & Soul. Here it is….
It might be marketed that way, but dietician Kate diPrima says there’s much more to it. “This is a 150 million dollar segment of the industry, which thought they’d catch some health-conscious males,” she says. “Generally, beer is low in carbohydrates. It’s the total kilojoule content that makes a difference to your beer gut. Fat has 37kj per gram, alcohol has 29kj per gram and carbohydrates have 16kj per gram. So it is far better, from a health perspective, to choose a low-alcohol or reduced-alcohol beer and overall, to drink less. Try drinking a pot (285ml), rather than a 375ml stubby.” she says.
“About 30-40 per cent of men will experience impotence,” says Christina Spaccavento, Acting CEO of Impotence Australia, sex therapist and relationship counsellor. Impotence can occur as a result of a medical, psychological or emotional condition, lifelong; or situational, Spaccavento notes. “Younger men will experience a higher level of psychological impotence, although this does tend to pass if they can deal with the emotions surrounding this. Older men tend to be affected for medical reasons, such as prostate, diabetes or heart issues,” she says. If you’re young and have experienced some level of erectile dysfunction make a visit to your doctor who will be able to look at the causes and, if necessary, make referral to sex therapist or specialist. For older men, Spaccavento advices to get a health check, “as it may be a sign of cardiovascular disease,” she says.
A study by psychologists from the University of Derby, England, found that men suffer cyclical moodiness, discomfort and loss of concentration, just as women may during PMT. However, not all PMT is created equal. “Men’s mood can also be influenced by normal fluctuations or drops in testosterone levels with age,” says psychologist Dr Elizabeth Celi.
“This isn’t necessarily clinical or of concern. Our hormones naturally regulate our reproductive systems as well as our mood, and therefore our information-processing abilities. Men have normal psychological systems with mood fluctuations like anyone else: to reduce it to a PMT-equivalent is somewhat simplistic. Women’s menstrual cycles aren’t the only thing to affect their moods either,” she says.
“Men tend to be less emotional, but they still experience strong emotions. The difference is, that they’re culturally trained to not identify or express their feelings,” says Paul Martin, Principal Psychologist at Centre for Human Potential, Brisbane. “When we have emotions in the limbic (emotional) area of the brain, these need to travel through the language area [of the brain] and out the mouth through speech, or by writing issues down. This is called processing our emotions. With men, when there are emotions other than anger, they’re unlikely to express them.”
So that joke about grumpy old men has a degree of truth? “If men never process their feelings, this can result in depression, stress or anxiety. Rather than tears, they’ll withdraw into themselves and become less emotionally available or grumpy,” Martin says.
“An understanding of masculinity is important when you’re dealing with men,” says Dr Ronald McCoy from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.
“Men usually hold the supportive role: we put a lot of responsibility on men to be the provider and to not be ill. Women are used to dealing with their health: pap smears, breast checks, childcare, and pregnancy. So when men get ill, it can be stressful and quite a shock to their emotions. Also, people overestimate how terrible a common cold can make you feel. It’s all about an individual’s response to their illness.” We women may think it’s humorous, but perhaps we should take their temperature before we get dismissive.
Are you kinky? That question could be answered in any variety of ways depending on who you ask. Kinky is as kinky does and your degree of kinkiness is defined by what you consider kinky. What may be vanilla sex to some people may be fetish play to others.
Every society develops norms, rules and standards for behavior. The same is true for sexual behavior. These standards vary from one society to the next, as well as in historical periods. They result in dividing people into mainly two groups: those that conform and those who deviate from the “norm”. In our current society, those that conform would fall into the category of vanilla sex, while those that do not would be called deviants or kinky. What may be acceptable to one society during a certain place and time may be a crime in another. In other words, human sexual behavior is a cultural construct, influenced by what a particular society deems acceptable.
In Western culture, our sexuality has been seriously repressed from the time we are young children and often lasts long into adulthood. These inbred social taboos often plague people with guilt and insecurities, effectively stopping or slowing their exploration of “forbidden” desires.
Yet, many women have at one time or another read an “erotic” novel and gotten turned on by it. These Harlequin Romance types of stories usually have themes of conflict and surrender, in which the woman is swept away by a handsome rogue often by force as she cries, “No! No!” while inside she shivers with ecstasy. Countless horror films turn the tables and put the woman in charge as the evil seductress who lures the man into their web of sex and deceit. We have Scream Queens, Damsels in Distress, Vamps and Femmes Fatale, all icons of popular culture that hint at the hidden desires we have buried inside.
More and more “vanilla” partners are exploring their sexuality by living out their fantasies and discovering various types of sexual “play”. From rough sex, to blindfolding, to playful spanking, KINK or BDSM is more mainstream than ever.
As children we learn to fantasize and play games to act these fantasies out. When we become adults, many of us lose this ability to play. But, being an adult does not mean you should deprive yourself of your sexual fantasies. Acting out fantasies and role-playing can create greater trust and intimacy between partners as well as help them to achieve a more sexually fulfilling and exciting sexual life.
According to Nancy Friday, many male and female sexual fantasies revolve around submission and dominance, or some surrender of control. Many sexual practices that are associated with paraphilias (or deviant sex) are becoming widely recognized as different and diverse forms of sexual play, or kinky sex, rather than a form of psychological deviancy. When practiced safety, sanely and between consensual adults, these acts are considered by most to be just another form of sexual expression.
Kink includes a wide spectrum of activities that are almost always eroticized by the participants in some fashion. Many of types of kinky activities can be found under the umbrella of BDSM, which include — but are not limited to — forms of dominance, submission, discipline, punishment, bondage, sexual role-playing, sexual fetishism, sadomasochism, and power exchange, as well as the full spectrum of mainstream sexual interactions.
Role-playing is exactly what it sounds like: each partner takes on a usually complementary, but unequal, role in which they enact personas and sexual fantasies. Typically, one is the top or dominant (the giver) and one is the bottom or submissive (the receiver), but these roles and activities are also interchangeable. Special forms of erotic role-play include age play, Doctor/nurse or Nurse/patient, Master/slave, Teacher/schoolgirl, puppy and pony-play, Goddess/worshipper, Punisher/victim, play rape scenarios as well as many others.
Have you ever had someone hold your hands down while having sex? If not, I highly recommend it as it is incredibly erotic. My first experience with this was how I found out I was “slightly” kinky. The simple action of holding someone down while have sex—rough dominant sex, if you will—is a form of dominance and submission. Doesn’t sound too kinky does it? Actually, sounds kind of fun! Now, if one were to add silk scarves or rope to tie you to the bedposts, that would take this one step further and you might think that was rather kinky, but maybe still doable. Or maybe you are getting wet just thinking about it? What is important with any type of kinky play, or dominance and submission, is that you talk about your fantasies together, decide your wants and limits, and do so conscentually.
As mentioned above, bondage, even being held down while having sex, can be for some people highly erotic. The term “Bondage” describes the practice of restraining for pleasure. Bondage, while kinky for some, is only another type of sexual expression for many couples or play partners, even in vanilla relationships. Types of bondage include using rope, hand cuffs, spreader bars, or even suspension. Another more “extreme” type of bondage is mummification in which someone is wrapped in plastic wrap or placed in bondage bags. Muzzles, hoods and even ball gags are also considered bondage because they are in some way restrictive.
Sensation play is a sensual way of touching your partner that is a wonderful form of erotic foreplay. It can consist of tying someone up and tickling them with a feather, rubbing fur or silk over their flesh while blindfolded, pouring hot candle wax on your partner’s skin to turn up the heat, using ice cubes to awaken and entice, or applying a pinwheel or other sharp instruments of torture to add an element of danger and excitement. Sensation play can add a level of eroticism that can bring your arousal to new heights of pleasure and passion.
Spanking is also another popular kinky practice that has made its way into mainstream vanilla sex. Spanking is a form of percussion play which is another form of touching someone that can be wildly erotic. It can include anything from light, playful spanking to flagellation with whips and paddles, to caning, flogging and everything in between. One person’s pain is another person’s pleasure. People who enjoy percussion may have spanking fantasies they’d love to fulfill. Many men and women enjoy the fantasy of being punished for real or imagined “bad behavior”. Some people enjoy being put into a submissive position, while others enjoy the physical sensation of getting their backside (or other sexual parts) warmed up.
Of course there are literally hundreds of types of kink, including a long list of fetishes and paraphilias that one could explore or desire. One person’s kink is another person’s vanilla.

Zombie games are very different, there is a race where you have to give the dead or to keep the protection of databases. Free zombie game you long to tighten the virtual world
In today's culture is firmly settled movies and games, the plot of which is the struggle with the dead come alive. Each year the directors make us happy couple-three films in which courageous team of heroes trying to survive in a city crowded with hungry and blood-thirsty monsters. You can meet and frankly low budget crafts, with make-up and special effects from the nearest supermarket and the real action, like Resident Evil and Zombieland. In turn, the game about zombies keep up with films, and now you can count hundreds of thousands of games that use the most sophisticated methods of extermination snarling undead. A distinctive feature of their diversity of acts - here you can come across as a chilling thriller in which players have to save each round and flinch at every rustle, and obviously humorous designs. For example, in the game "Plants vs. Zombies", which is also in the category of zombie games for free, you have to defend against with his own martial-grown horticultural crops. Perhaps there is no single game genre to which these have got ever hungry creatures. But still the leader in this category are the shooter in which you have to select a weapon to their liking and go on a crusade against the blatant undead. By the way, free zombie games often provide quite an impressive arsenal of weapons: pistols, rifles, flamethrowers, rocket launchers and explosives - this is just a brief list of what the developers have prepared to help your brave hero. If you're not a supporter of brute force and does not appeal to you constantly put pressure on the trigger, breaking through the slender ranks of the walking dead, the game for you zombies 2 come in the genre of "survival." Then you will not give a military ammunition depot, as each cartridge and a first aid kit will be on the bill. A better tactic in these games will not look for trouble, and he slowly escape from superior enemy forces. Zombies and got to onlaynovskih flash games. However, this role is assigned to them rather humorous, and these games can be played even children. Zombie games online are often presented in the most unlikely of genres. For example, they can go bowling or Arkanoid, where instead of pins and balls are the zombies. As its name suggests, these games are targeted primarily at people endowed with a very black sense of humor. If you consider yourself to be such, then the category of games about zombies created especially for you.
Assume that $(N,L)$, is a pair of finite dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras, in which $L$ is non-abelian and $N$
is an ideal in $L$ and also $\mathcal{M}(N,L)$ is the Schur multiplier of the pair $(N,L)$. Motivated by characterization of the pairs $(N,L)$ of finite dimensional nilpotent Lie algebras by their Schur multipliers (Arabyani, et al. 2014) we prove some properties of a pair of nilpotent Lie algebras and generalize results for a pair of non-abelian nilpotent Lie algebras.

Pervasive games represent a unique challenge for teachers and designers. By definition they escape the traditional temporal, spatial, and social boundaries that often contain play, often taking place over large public geographies with big player communities, and ill-defined play sessions. This makes them difficult to playtest and iterate for designers, and it often renders them inaccessible to students. Games like Pac Manhattan can be studied by students via videos and online documentation, but these are often inadequate for communicating the lived experience of play that is central to game design education. In this article we explore how toys, props, and costumes can be used in combination with simple prompts as design materials for the creation of public pervasive game play experiences. We describe two classroom exercises which use readily available analog materials to create alternate realities within the campus environment.
In previous work we have drawn on techniques from theater and performance studies to explore how props and costumes help create opportunities for players to better identify with the characters of a fictional world. We view props and toys as a form of embodied narrative interface that uses the players own bodily experiences and sense memory to evoke meaningful narrative experiences of play. Costumes and props act like user interfaces: they can take on aesthetic and semantic aspects of a fictional world and they afford and constrain player activity in ways that are evocative and meaningful. We call costumes and props “costumes” and “props” within the formal context of theatre practice, but within more informal play we would simply call them toys. Certainly, toys serve the same purpose as costume and props. They are containers for narrative scripts, with affordances and constraints that can shape the behavior of their users in meaningful and evocative ways. More so than other physical objects, toys are the crystallization of meanings and behaviors into an artifact. And of course, they are also equipment for play.
In the following sections, we describe two exercises which show how toys—props and costumes—are central to the practice of game design. These exercises were implemented in a class that we taught on Mobile and Ubiquitous Games at UC Irvine in the Spring of 2016.
Students used different architectural features on campus as constraints for their designs. Image used with permission by the authors.
Chalk was a toy that helped to motivate the design for the activity, “Walk ‘n’ Chalk.” In this activity, students were encouraged to use chalk to alter their taken for granted day-to-day environment. For us, chalk was an ideal material for a public game design intervention. Chalk is impermanent, but with a useful half-life, especially in lightly trafficked spaces. This means that while it can meaningfully alter an environment it doesn’t entail a student designer in any lasting intervention into the space. Chalk is a permissive medium, affording experimentation and risk taking. Chalk is also a performative medium for design, because the student must undertake the design in full view of potential spectators and players. The act of altering a public space – even temporarilly and nondestructively – implies some defiance towards the normative uses of that space.
Chalk games also colonized natural elements on campus, like this tree root obstacle course. Image used with permission by the authors.
“Walk ‘n’ Chalk” was inspired in part by a game discussed by Celia Pearce in her GDC’15 presentation. The activity she describes is one that she has run in a number of contexts, including Siggraph 2005 and IndieCade 2012. In this activity, participants use chalk to create new versions of “hopscotch” that remediate existing digital games in public spaces. Pearce’s hopscotch games are often based on existing digital games (e.g., “DDR Hopscotch”) but they can also be thematically inspired (as in the case of “extreme hopscotch” and “non-cartesian hopscotch”). Mary Flanagan describes a similar chalk-based game design activity that she calls “Hyper Gendered Hopscotch” where players/designers are asked to unpack and explore their assumptions about gendered behavior through the design of new hopscotch games.
We took the chalk games of Pearce and Flanagan as inspiration for our first activity, the “Walk’n’Chalk”, but varied the design slightly to better emphasize the specific affordances of the campus context. We provided the students with examples of different chalk-based games, and then gave them the following instructions:
Grab some chalk! In the time remaining in class, we are going to create and play some sidewalk games around campus. These games don’t need to be very complicated. Have at least one member of your group taking pictures and documenting the process. Try to get passersby to playtest your game. Try to keep from getting into trouble with school authorities.
Use the environment! Stairs, pathways, hidden areas, open spaces, bottlenecks, and ledges are your friends. Think about how to scale-up the difficulty Can you create an altered reality? A compelling fiction?”
The goal of this activity was to give students a simple toy, chalk, for making site-specific interventions into the campus environment. We asked each team to document their games and to observe how members of the campus community interacted with their designs. The chalk in this activity acts as a “meta-toy”, or a “toy for making more toys”. Chalk transforms the environment itself into a playground: it imposes rules and meanings on the environment that then produce new relationships between spectators and space. Tiles become “lava”, stairs become obstacles, railings and ledges become cliffs and balance beams. In this way, a toy like sidewalk chalk operates as a low-tech tool for augmented reality (AR) game design.
“You are a group of time-traveling historians visiting [campus] to study the social rituals and behaviors of primitive 21st century university students prior to the collapse of the First American Empire. You have researched your subjects meticulously and gone to great lengths to re-create the clothing and accessories of the time period, but your historical records have grouped the entire 50 years of “pre-collapse” history into a single era, and so you don’t fully grok that fashions and trends changed radically between 1970 and 2020. Consequentially, you might have some trouble blending in. As historians, you know that the world you are visiting is poised upon a precipice, ready to plunge into social, political, economic, and ecological chaos for several hundred years, but your research subjects do not know this. You must conduct research into the attitudes and beliefs of this era, without disrupting the timeline, or revealing your extra-temporal origins. This will be complicated by the fact that your time machine cannot pinpoint dates effectively, so you don’t know what time you have traveled to.”
Our second example, the “Time Travel Larp,” was initially inspired by a similar Live Action Role Playing (LARP) assignment taught by Richard Lemarchand at USC as part of his Experimental Game Topics: Avant-Garde Games & Player-Artists class. The goal was to create a role-playing experience that could scale to the class of 63 students, that didn’t involve simulated combat, and that required them to interact with ordinary people on campus to socially expand the magic circle.
Inspired by research into cosplay, and our own previous work on costumed play, we instructed the students to arrive in “costumes” which needed to betray that they were time travelers trying (unsuccessfully) to blend in. Our previous work on costumed play has highlighted the ways in which wearing narratively salient clothing can both alter the social performance and perception of a player (e.g.: people treat you differently when you’re wearing an elaborate Princess Peach wig and dress) and how a player constructs their own relationship to a character and sense of self (e.g.: when you’re wearing the dress and wig you become aware of the impact of the clothing on the character on the screen, and you construct a different sympathetic/empathetic relationship with the character). This aligns with the experiences that actors have of wearing their characters costumes for the first time in rehearsal. The costume both constitutes and communicates alternative identities. We provided visual references for the clothing of the different eras encompassed in the narrative, and encouraged them to coordinate looks within their groups. We also provided a series of questions for students to ask in their guises as future historians researching life in the early 21st century.
We had also learned from conversations with Richard Lemarchand that his students spent a large portion of their semester developing their LARP characters. We didn’t have room in the schedule to do this. Instead we provided our students with “character personality” and “character secret” tables (included in the appendix), which we used to help structure their roleplaying.
As with the chalk activity, we encouraged students to document and reflect upon their experience of performing in-character around campus. The teaching team also dressed in costume and circulated around campus in order to check-in with teams and observe their interactions with the campus population.
The props and costumes used in this activity played a significant role in how the students and the teaching team interacted with each other and the broader campus community. One student brought a classic boom box with a mix tape of pop music from the ‘80s that he could blast loudly while walking around. Another student embraced the Doctor Who time travel mythos and arrived in class with a suit, fez, and “sonic screwdriver”. One student determined that in his future, monkeys had evolved sentience, and so spent the LARP wearing a simian mask. Within the instructional team, we created a few props that allowed us to interact with and encourage students while maintaining the fictional premise. Professor Tanenbaum created a belt-worn device with knobs and dials on it, and an antique phone handset that he used to communicate back to his “superiors in the future”. This prop was especially useful because it allowed him to engage in loud improvised conversations within the public space, even when there wasn’t a willing interlocuter, and it allowed him to convey information and ideas to student groups when he encountered them on campus.
It is essential to get students designing and playing pervasive games as quickly as possible, with as few barriers to entry as possible. Toys, in this exercise, were an invaluable design medium, helping to efficiently focus student attention on the narrative and mechanical structures of the games they were engaging with.
Prior to the start of this class, very few of our students had heard the term pervasive games, let alone played or designed one themselves. The “Walk’n’Chalk” activity allowed them to begin designing and playing with site-specificity and spatial expansion of the magic circle. Not only did students get to experience bystanders being transformed into players by their games, but the chalk lasted around campus for weeks, resulting in an inadvertent experience of temporal expansion. The LARP activity gave them a chance to experience a socially expanded design, and provided a small taste of a fully immersive experience. In their documentation and reflections, it was clear how deeply toys had intervened in this process: many students expressed surprise that wearing a silly hat and talking to strangers could result in such a transformative role-playing experience.
The chalk, costumes, props, and toys used in these exercises were not simply “gimmicks” or “accessories” for the students (and instructors). They were the material signifiers that allowed for the creation and maintenance of an alternate reality for both players and spectators. In the LARP world, there is the concept of the “three-sixty illusion” wherein players of a game are able to completely substitute the fictional reality for the real one. Perhaps the most effective and infamous example of this occurred during the Prosopopeia project when a team of players inadvertently assaulted a homeless spectator who had fallen asleep within a chalk circle that had been drawn to indicate the presence of a Non-Player-Character (NPC). External signifiers like chalk markings, secret messages, costumes, and other apparatus were essential to how Prosopopeia established and maintained its fictional overlay on top of reality. In our two examples, we did not set out to accomplish anything as ambitious as the three-sixty illusion, but the use of similar tools and toys helped us to create momentary fictional realities.
We have identified some distinct challenges to teaching and designing pervasive games. Our goal with these exercises is to help to lower the barriers to entry that prevent students and designers from creating pervasive play experiences, and to show how toys, props, and costumes can help create opportunities for students, instructors, and spectators to imagine and inhabit alternative realities within the context of their daily lives. By reconceiving the game design class as a unique resource for creating these kinds of games, we hope to provide a roadmap for future classroom innovations that teach difficult design skills and advance our knowledge of different game forms.
We’d like to thank the students of UC Irvine’s Spring 2016 ICS 163: Mobile and Ubiquitous Games class for their enthusiastic participation in these design explorations.

I have been struggling a bit lately regarding my reading material. I used to belong to a book club but don’t anymore and I find I have a hard time finding new books to read. I picked up these two from Costco the other day:
I read her other book - Sarah’s Key - and loved it so I am hoping that this one is just as good. I think the author was able to bring such power to the characters and events that it made a historical fiction book come to life.
I find Marilyn Munroe a fascinating. She left such a legacy after her death as one of the most recognizable movie stars in history. I think everyone knows who she is without having ever seen one of her movies.
I read Sarah's Key and loved it! I was thinking of picking up A Secret Kept for my mom for Christmas. Let me know how it is and I might have to get it for myself too :)

For under $13, one can get a very tasty japanese curry and soup, or salad set which makes a teriffic dinner for the busy melbournian worker on the go!
I usually go here fairly religiously every fortnight or so, when i have things on in the city after work.
The curry and rice, which comes in vegetarian, beef, or chicken is particularly good, with a thick, tasty, perfectly textured, rich brown gravy like curry sauce, generous chunks of meat or vegies, and the bed of rice is a perfectly steamed mix of wild rice varieties and white rice, all of which is allegedly organic.
A friend recently took me to another place, “don Don” which also did cheap japanese curries.. but i’d rather pay a few extra dollars to go to this place!
While i typically go for the cheap and cheerful, studenty sort of meals, there is a rather extensive full menu which is a bit pricier. As yet, i have not explored it myself, but other customers are all happily tucking into their meals, which look and smell quite terrific, so i can only assume the rest of the menus selections are as equallly promising!
in particular, their innovative and quirky experimental projects, especially the dessert menu look worth investigating!

Hebrew University will host a conference at the end of the month on the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, a reflection of growing concerns amongst Israel’s political, cultural and academic elites about the Palestinian-led boycott.
Despite a lack of funding and solid organizational backing at home, the Palestinian diaspora in Europe has increased its activities and is winning ever stronger support, costing Israel more in economic losses and international status by the week.
In a statement, the university (Birzeit) noted that Israel’s oppressive acts against the Palestinians, especially students, reinforce the need for an international boycott, including an academic boycott of Israeli institutions.
"University of Barcelona announces official boycott of Israeli occupation" (The Palestinian Information Center, Dec 20, 2015): click here!
The Central University of Barcelona (UAB) announced its decision to boycott Israeli universities and institutions that have ties, whether direct or indirect, with the occupation of Palestine.
In excess of 200 scholars in South Africa on Tuesday declared their support for the boycott, adding to those of more than 600 who pledged a similar boycott in the UK in October, and a subsequent pledge by more than 120 Irish scholars.

The early progression of diabetic nephropathy is notoriously difficult to detect and quantify prior to the occurrence of substantial histological damage. Recently, hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate has demonstrated increased lactate production in the kidney early after the onset of diabetes, implying increased lactate dehydrogenase activity as a consequence of increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide substrate availability due to upregulation of the polyol pathway, i.e., pseudohypoxia. In this study, we investigated the role of oxidative stress in mediating these metabolic alterations using state-of-the-art hyperpolarized magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Ten-week-old female Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: healthy controls, untreated diabetic (streptozotocin treatment to induce insulinopenic diabetes), and diabetic, receiving chronic antioxidant treatment with TEMPOL (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl) via the drinking water. Examinations were performed 2, 3, and 4 weeks after the induction of diabetes by using a 3T Clinical MR system equipped with a dual tuned 13C/1H-volume rat coil. The rats received intravenous hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate and were imaged using a slice-selective 13C-IDEAL spiral sequence. Untreated diabetic rats showed increased renal lactate production compared to that shown by the controls. However, chronic TEMPOL treatment significantly attenuated diabetes-induced lactate production. No significant effects of diabetes or TEMPOL were observed on 13C-alanine levels, indicating an intact glucose-alanine cycle, or 13C-bicarbonate, indicating normal flux through the Krebs cycle. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that diabetes-induced pseudohypoxia, as indicated by an increased lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, is significantly attenuated by antioxidant treatment. This demonstrates a pivotal role of oxidative stress for renal metabolic alterations occurring in early diabetes.

My journey to South West London was just about as idyllic as you can get, sun out, window down, the smooth voice of John Suchet on Classic FM. Tom’s on the other hand, via a commuter packed train from Victoria was let's say, one I’m glad I missed out on.
“Suns out, guns out” he says to me, one arm flexed up by his face, as he notices I’m scandalously only wearing a t-shirt to drive in. Flinging his heavy winter coat on the back seat, he explains that he “wasn't expecting this”. My choice of music, has him a little amused and confused in good measure, mistaking a bit of Brahms for the “Archers”. It’s not only Tom waiting for a lift at the station, one of today's players from Tonbridge Angels FC (TB) in his sky blue tracksuit, is standing patiently on the pavement.
The War Memorial Sports Ground, home of Carshalton Athletic FC is the venue, as it was last year, for the Ryman League Cup Final or Alan Turvey trophy, tonight we complete our hat trick of finals going back to 2015. We are early, we are always early, but we're not the first here, some players of tonight's other finalists Billericay Town FC (BT) are already here, as are the robin crested, red shirt wearing staff, who are flitting about, completing the finishing touches, before they are descended upon by more players, fans and old men in blazers, in about an hour's time.
Before then, we join the early birds in the clubhouse, where the rearranged Borussia Dortmund Vs Monaco game is about to kick off on the big TV and Tom unable to get his hands on a Red Bull, so has to settle for a lesser known imitation, Red Alert, to wash down his pickled onion Monster Munch.
“Everyone wants to beat us” says one of the BT players to the others around his table. Since their meteoric rise to fame and many column inches, after some big money signings, two of whom have a Premier League pedigree, they have become quite the focus of the non league world. The player only hopes “next year, it will die down”. When pressed on tonight, he seems confident, explaining how BT “should be beating” TB, especially after their recent “2-1” victory in the league.
Soon some fans of each team arrive, many sporting a club scarf hanging from a hand bag strap or belt. Once each group has found a table they head to the bar, “beer” grunts one when asked what he wants, and the solo bar woman is set to work.
Outside the warm sun of earlier, has all but gone, and has been replaced by grey clouds, “gonna rain” says Tom. More players have arrived, mostly TB’s, who are either on the pitch or on one of the commandeered crop of nearby picnic tables. A few perhaps agreeing with Tom’s weather prediction, have decided to take shelter in one of the dug outs, which sit in front of the grounds most notable feature, an immense pitch length terrace, with its long concrete steps, deep back wall, and roof topped with St George's crosses, flying from white flag poles.
More busy Carshalton staff weave among the relaxing players, a woman with an arm full of biscuits and milk, is heading for the boardroom, which is basically a large wooden shed, where someone has just asked very loudly, “where are the biscuits?”.
“Someone just arrived” points out Tom, who though, we're not sure. All we can see is the top of the reversing beeping coach over the stand behind the goal in the car park. BT are running a little late, something to do with a snarl up on the motorway, I overhear one player telling another of the “nightmare” that is the Dartford Crossing. One BT fan mistaking Tom for a fellow supporter, which happens quite a lot, wonders why the “boys” are “not here yet?”. Not being a fan of the Essex club or being aware of their current travel predicaments, he does his sigh and eye roll, which miraculously seems to satisfy, and always manages to get him out of tricky situations.
Those TB players who are here, look a little lost for what to do, BT’s delay, leaving them with some time to kill. They entertain themselves by pulling the leg of one club official, who is wearing his finest, for the big occasion. “Hello Charlie, got dressed up?” one asks, “Hugo Boss?” asks another.
The arrival of BT is soon the talk of the ground, sending many people with cameras scattering for a shot of Paul Konchesky once of Liverpool and West Ham and Jamie O’Hara, wearing the customary big headphones, who most recently was of the diary room in Big Brother, but also of Fulham, Wolves and of course Spurs.
Music is already coming from behind the TB dressing room door, the names of the ‘home’ and ‘away’ teams, stuck to the outside. By the looks of it, it won't be long before the music is playing in BT’s either, as at the back of the long line of people carrying bags and water bottles, one man struggles with a huge white sound system. Although BT have been designated the ‘home’ team for tonight, one of their entourage queries why are they playing in their “away kit”.
A TB player heading to the pitch for the warm up, is stopped momentarily by an old fella offering up his own support “come on boys”, another supporter is wearing a floor length Tom Baker style blue and white scarf, which I complement him on, and he tells me his "sister" knitted it for him. One of BT’s fans are far from impressed by the venue “stupid fucking place to have a final” he announces, looking over the pitch, arms crossed, with a very sour look on his face.
My attention is quickly diverted from Mr Cheery Chops, by a small commotion behind him, a bit of rutting between a member of the BT board and the Carshalton Athletic secretary, who is not best pleased about being challenged on the lack of bar staff, the single lady by all accounts has become a little overcome, and the BT inquisitor is given short shrift by the spectacle wearing man, whose scarlet face now matches his top, “bugger back off to Essex”.
The noise of the players warming up, is for once rivaled by the noise of the ever increasing crowd, most of whom seem to be standing in the snaking queue for the burger bar, which has thoroughly upset Tom. Some though instead of waiting an age for something to eat, have already secured a dark red seat in the small main stand where according to one sign "children are prohibited from playing" or a step on the mega terrace. BT are the first in, after what doesn't feel like very long warming up, TB are a while behind them, but eventually leave the immaculate pitch empty. Immaculate may I add because it’s a 4G and not because of an unprecedented level of groundsmanship, which is what Tom thought, until his personal eureka moment.
There are plenty of “come ons” and other such encouragement coming from the changing rooms, along with the obligatory loud music now blaring from them both, until the shouting players are replaced by what sounds like an amateur dramatics chorus line.
I head towards the mass sing song, coming from BT's dressing room. The door ever so slightly ajar, propped open by a man in a hi viz waistcoat, holding a very big camera that’s recording what’s going on inside, there is just about enough room for me to position myself, and bare witness to something I imagine will go down in football folklore, something I’ll be able to tell my grandchildren “I was there”.
All on their feet, dazzling in their neon orange stripe, arms linked and led by the clubs owner/manager Glen Tamplin, they are belting out a rendition of R Kellys 'The Worlds Greatest". “Close your eyes” demands the manager to the group of compliant but ever so slightly skeptical looking players, “think about today” he tells them. Outside, a few TB staff look on baffled by what is taking place a few feet away, the BT R’n’B war cry is in full flow.
However that is not all, sadly they don’t move on to a version of the theme tune from everyone's favourite basketball real life cartoon cross over film, instead Glenn Tamplin is now standing before his now seated squad, reading from a script, engaging in a bit more audience participation. “I’m honored to be taking you on to the field of battle” he tells them, as he starts his own version of the Any Given Sunday speech, each declaration “right now we fight, right now we believe” concludes in the same way, “who are we?”, he stops and waits for the reply from the players, “the greatest”.
Each delivery from the gaffa, goes up a notch, the veins in his considerable neck and enormous arms, grow a little bigger, he is definitely in Tom’s “suns out guns out” camp. He expects an equally raucous response from the players, most are happy to oblige, some though have their eyes firmly fixed on their laces, “fucking rip out the heart of my enemies”.
The ring of the bell, almost cuts him a bit short, but he just shouts over it, “every fucking inch today, we fight and we win, who are we, who are we, WHO ARE WE?”, snarling, shaking his fist, towards the player's, “THE GREATEST”. All his hard work pumping his team up, is nearly undone when a green and black league tie wearing man, informs him of the building crowds outside, late arriving fans, who are yet to get let in. He is asked if he is happy for them to delay kick off, but he’s not “I wanna kick off”, it’s emphasized that its “your people” who are waiting to get in, but he is fully in the zone, he has fluffed the players to near climax.
It’s not until the teams have left the tunnel, followed by various coaches and physios, do I become aware of the size of the crowd, that continued to swell as I loitered around the changing room, like a Cat’s fan at the stage door of an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. I also hear for the first time, what might just be the nicest chant in all of football “come on Angels”. Both group of fans, keenly watch the toss, not fussed one bit about what way their team will be playing, but simply wanting to know which goal they need to set up camp behind for the first half.
Both fans and players alike are off to a lightning start, flags are quickly up at both ends, the songs soon start, “Tonbridge, Tonbridge” sing the fans from Kent led by a drum. The fans from Essex are without a drum but the hoarding seems a suitable replacement, and is getting a bit of a ‘Ketsbaia’.
BT have two chances in a matter of thirty seconds, one is blazed over from close range, and it looks like the team in orange are going to get off to the perfect start, however it’s not their end that is engulfed in thick blue smoke, blotting their fans from view, it’s not their fans singing “no pyro, no party”, it’s not the team who came out the blocks flying, but the team who have been very much on the back foot for the frantic opening five minutes of the encounter that have taken the lead, 1 - 0 TB.
“Tonbridge is wonderful” sing the foggy fans, the smoke still rolling out from under the roof of the small metal stand, ‘Fred’s End’ which looks like it might be close to falling down, the celebrating fans are using it to accompany the drum, “everywhere we go, everywhere we go”.
Already close to a football induced meltdown, pyro, drumming, flags, two sets of singing fans, but if the blue and white beach ball that has entered the pitch, had been someway responsible for the BT equaliser, well you would have had to call the St Johns Ambulance, however it’s at the opposite end of the ground from the beach accessory, that the scorer has just slotted in and run towards the crowd to be embraced by the fans.
This time it’s the BT fans celebrating, adding to the pandemonium of the first fifteen minutes. “Singing i - i - ippy, we come from Billericay!”. TB’s fans reply, but it’s ever so slightly muted, “come on Tonbridge”, the garbled voice after the bizarre post goal music they play here, confirms it's the “equalizer”, the BT fans continue in full voice “follow the ‘Ricay, over land and sea” and as if someone actually wanted to see me require medical attention, a second beach ball is tossed on the pitch.
The TB fans are not tongue-tied for long, asking the BT supporters, “where were you when you were shit?”.
Tom is “getting hungry” the pre match queue has thrown him a bit out of whack, but he is far more concerned for the welfare of ‘Fred’s End’, “it’s getting a bit rowdy in there” and he just doesn't know how the simple structure is going to “cope”.
Not unsurprisingly both teams are unable to keep up the frantic tempo, but the TB fans don't feel they are getting the rub of the green. “Studs up!” says Tom after a partially robust tackle or “dirty foul” as he puts it, although the referee reprimands the guilty player, it’s not as harsh as the TB followers thought it should be, “behave yourself” one suggests towards the man in charge. “We’re the Angels, We’re the Angels” they sing, continuing the ecclesiastical theme when they finally get a call their way “hallelujah”. This though has the opposite effect on the BT fans, who think it's a case of “same old Tonbridge always cheating”.
Although we love a smoke bomb and some pyro, we love the adoption of the ways of our European and South American cousins, club officials don’t, they take a very dim view indeed. The gray haired man in the TB tie is looking very disappointed teacher at the young fan passing him, who he is quizzing about the post goal show. His view being I’m sure the fine from the league, could be better spent elsewhere, regardless of how cool it looks.
“Not a bad drummer” comments Tom, a little rudimentary “we’re the blue and white army” is about his speed, he's no Charlton, but whether be he John Bonham or Ringo Starr, it’s just great to have one.
After the abundance of early chances, the game has descended into a messy, scrappy midfield squabble, starved of any real quality. A BT player puts it wide one on one, then O’Hara takes a long range pot shot, that sails over, “what a waste of money” sing the TB fans. One fan pointing out he is not a Tottenham, Wolverhampton or Portsmouth cast off, but a team a little closer to home “Gillingham reject”.
All change, on thirty minutes this long range attempt finds the target, with a little help from the keeper, the ball looked to go right through him and BT have gone from one behind to two ahead.
Chances for BT and big tackles, one forcing Tom to gasp and flinch, are the order of the day, the early TB lead, feels like a distant memory, as BT go close again. The TB fans find ways to distract themselves from the onslaught, as Tom points out, one is doing “chin ups” from the roof of the stand.
It’s getting close to half time, and of course Tom is thinking of food. I warn him of the big queue, he doesn't care, people sporadically passing us holding something cooked in a napkin, have grown stubble in the time they have been waiting.
TB look close to drawing things level, but one player inadvertently denies a team mate, heading the ball, instead of leaving it for the player behind him, who was better placed, and was shaping up for a volley. It feels like a bit of a ‘what if’ moment, as not long after BT further their lead. “Second time he's done that” says Tom, as the same player doubles his tally, with an almost carbon copy of his first.
“Heads up boys” is the solemn single shout of one TB fan, towards his dejected team. Further shouts of “come on Angels” sound just as sad, the fans have lost all that energy and enthusiasm, that made the smoke filled rocking little stand such an awesome spectacle. The loudest by far of them all, is a woman among them, whose completely inaudible, but her volume is quite the opposite to the stunned and silenced crowd around her.
“Can they survive to half time” Tom wonders, two goals down is not insurmountable, but they are well and truly on the ropes and BT are looking for the knockout blow.
More of a low blow not seen by the referee, then a well slipped counter, or spectacular uppercut, BT grab a fourth, and as Tom does, in moments like these, he utters his familiar two word catchphrase “game over”. First half hat trick complete, with a lot of help from a deflection off a TB defender, the post goal Euro pop is now getting tedious, I hope for no more goals, only so we’re not subjected to it again.
The BT fans now poking fun at their once noise equaling rivals, “it’s all gone quiet over there” before they remind us all where they are from “Essex, Essex, Essex”. Some TB fans have seen enough, “going off to the pub”. One of them, whose curious limp makes me think that someone else should be carrying the large decorated drum, is in fact not injured, but suffering from a bad case of ‘flare down the trousers’itus’’, a single smoke grenade falls from the bottom of his jeans like a moment from the Great Escape, explaining his curious gait.
Flags are soon down at each end, and it’s easy to pick out among the groups of fans criss-crossing in
front of me, who supports who. Once again the music is a point of interest, track two from ‘Banging Ibiza ‘98’ has been replaced by something with a Caribbean vibe, imagine a Lilt or Malibu advert. Through the mixed crowd of dejected and jubilant fans, I pick out a face that is sadder than those of the team who have just conceded four first half goals in a cup final, it’s Tom, empty handed, “about 100 people” in the queue for food he tells me, not totally downbeat, he has a plan, he'll try again in the “second half”.
Tom could maybe try his luck in the boardroom shed for something to eat, however by the sounds of it, two ladies talking next to us are not overly impressed by the spread “one cup of tea and a biscuit” is all one got her hands on, gosh life is hard in the jewelry jangling seats.
“Welcome back Tonbridge Angels and Billericay Town” says the voice over the tannoy accompanied by a piece of music from a mid 90’s Top Gear montage, that just makes me want to shout POWER, and I think we may have already found a ground where the music can rival that played at Bowers & Pitsea.
BT’s fans take up from where the TB fans left off, ‘Fred’s End’ is in for one hell of a forty-five minutes, “whoooo oooo BILLERICAY”. The team also pick up right from where they left off, grabbing their fifth of the night, killing off the early TB songs “we’re the Angels”, confirming, like I didn't know already, that any notion of the “comeback” that Tom and I mulled over at half time, has gone right out the window, I’m always hopeful for a bit of romance, but this is beyond even realms of fantasy and the BT fans are greedy for more, “we want six”. It also dawns on us just how shocking the queue for food is, as one BT fans passes by telling a fellow supporter that he finally got something “3 days later” which answers Tom’s earlier query of “what do you think the queues doing now?”.
TB’s fans are only ever briefly speechless and are always quick to gather themselves and go again, the drumming a constant. They finally get something to cheer since the fifth minute, when a bit of fortune finally goes their way, a towering salmon like leap from a BT player, results in a quite spectacular own goal, “he scores when he wants” declare his own fans, following their players mistake. The voice on the tannoy, after the bloody music, again, doesn't give the name of the offender (it was Paul Konchesky) but just blurts out “was an own goal” before flicking off the mic.
Tom’s reattempt to get food means he is somewhere in the never depleting line, when the own goal was scored. Before he made off on his second attempt to conquer it, he hoped that BT didn’t score “too many goals” while he was away, I can’t promise him anything, they are rampant, and look like they will score at every opportunity.
“We’re going to win 6 - 5” sing those in the TB end, bolstered by the slight denting of the BT lead, who are still making a good racquet, despite the deficit. However their patience might be tested when four minutes after getting one back, they might have to change the chant to we’re going to win 7 - 6 as BT sweep down the other end, finishing off a swift counter attack getting their sixth of the night.
Any concerns of a lack of action from Tom “think there will be goals?” he asked pre kick off, has been totally and 100% put to the sword. Also any notion of this going to extra time and penalties, which we weren't sure if they did both or just a shoot out, but then neither was the Ryman League press secretary when we asked him, and he was too "embarrassed" to ask for clarification from a colleague, won't be a concern either. The BT fans are now reminding TB that at one point today, they were actually in front “1 - 0 and you fucked it up” all that joy and blue smoke, a lifetime ago.
I can’t emphasize enough how excellent the TB fans have been in the face of the most resounding hiding, you are ever likely to see. Yes that bloke may well have gone off to the pub at half time to drink away his sorrow, but those who have stayed, are still singing, and the drum is still going. The quick footwork of their keeper prevents them conceding a seventh goal, but they still continue their support.
One though has gone a little rogue, slumped across a couple of seats in the main stand, like Scarface in his big chair, he shouts for anything and everything. “Hand ball”, it wasn't even close, “we’ll appeal anything” he says, before announcing he “can't be arsed”. I’m sure instead of watching anymore of the game, he just wants to bury his face in a pile of coke and pet a tiger cub right about now.
“Easy, easy, easy” sing the BT fans, who by now have surpassed all earlier levels of hysteria and are heading for another stratosphere. Not in all their wildest dreams, except that one joker who was asked before kick off for a prediction and said they would score “7” who is now smugger than a Cheshire cat and is a demi god among his peers, could they have imagined they would see their team score seven tonight. They now have a blood lust, like a wild village hoard they demand, “we want 8”, but have replaced pitchforks and farming implements, with the humming of the Rocky theme tune. All while the TB drummer still drums, he won't capitulate, even if his team have.
In the short time since our first encounter with BT, back in February for the semi final, there have been plenty of comings and goings. There has been an influx of signings, their manager then, has been replaced by the owner, who the fans now serenade “Glenn Tamplin’s blue and white army”, he acknowledges their song with an above the head clap back at them.
BT’s keeper finally has something to do, his save with his feet looking all the more dramatic, considering he has been standing still for the last hour, however most dramatic of all, the drum has finally fallen quiet, but at least they still have the woman, and her deafening screams. At the opposite end, I think it’s going to be a long time until any BT fans are quiet again, given up on film theme tunes, they are now considering a pitch invasion “on the pitch, on the pitch”.
I am happy to report the drum is still alive, its final swan song, is prompted by a nice TB move and curling shot that just goes over, which the BT fans also applaud, but with sarcasm, not love. Not only is the drum having a last hurrah, with BT having fully taken their foot off the gas, TB are able to rack up a few chances, and have a big shout for a penalty waved away.
The lack of pressure is not bothering the BT fans, who continue to sing “oh what a night, watching ‘Ricay on a Wednesday night”, and even though their team have won this, they get to witness a staggering 8th goal. TB’s keeper nearly stopped it, but it squirmed under him.
“We can see you sneaking out” sing the BT fans, as a few more TB fans head for the pub, those leaving and those staying are reminded once again, that they were actually ahead at one point, not that you would believe it, looking at the score, “1 - 0 and you fucked it up”. One player following the celebration motions to the fans for more noise, which might inadvertently result in the complete destruction of ‘Fred's End’, which amazingly is still somehow standing.
TB hit the post and then add to the score making it 8 - 3. The board goes up with three minutes on, and O’Hara tries his luck from range with a cheeky lob, which misses but pleases the fans “same old ‘Ricay, taking the piss”. Toying with TB like a cat with its prey, they pass the ball around nonchalantly, almost, almost getting a ninth!
Plenty happens following the final whistle, most of the time its to the chant of "what a waste of money" BT I assume feeling that the win tonight, justifying the expenditure of the owner, who is enjoying every moment of the victory. As the plinth that held the ball before kickoff is brought back onto the pitch, now with the blue and orange adorned trophy on it, along with a foldout table covered with a table cloth and medals and the sponsored backdrop for all the pictures, BT approach their excitable fans to celebrate, one so thrilled his attempt to climb the railing to join them, is miss judged, he ends up landing on his head, but the adrenaline means he is able to pick himself up and dust himself off without injury.
Players, staff and management walk the railing, shaking and high fiving the many outstretched hands, hugging those who require a bit more intimacy, some are handed flags, scarves and even a woolly hat that Jamie O'Hara pops on.
The depressed blue line of TB players, almost as sad as Tom after his failed food attempts are up first to get their medals, Tamplin quick to ensure his team applaude their defeated foe. As captain it's O'Hara's duty to do the honours, but he seems resistant to hog the limelight, instead insisting the rest of the team join him to lift the cup.
A multitude of selfies and pictures later, chants of "champione" and talk of money subsides, some generic football final victory jingle playing instead, Tamplin goes full Mourinho tossing his medal into the crowd, before blowing kisses like a true lovey to the adoring crowd, who sing his name once more. Him and his team eventually head for the dressing room, and there is talk of "champagne".
Our night ends not as well as the staggering well dressed couple looking for the way out, but in an unintentionally intense and very close quarters chat with Tamplin himself. Up close we realise as Tom puts it what a "unit" he is and how every digit of his hands are decorated with some giant ring of some sort. Maybe a little curious of two no marks asking for his opinion on the evening, its not until we explain who are are and what we are doing, that the tension is lessened, when he tells us he "agrees" with our thoughts on non league football.
I'm sure there will much talk about the methods and practices of Tamplin, for all those who turn their nose up at his prematch exploits, there could be a case of saying it did some good, you can't argue with a five goal winning margin. It's been proven that simply chucking money at clubs can be a slippery slope, there are sadly many examples of ones where its not worked, if BT will become another statistic, only time will tell.
Tonight you might say was Essex Vs Kent, fan owned club Vs a bank rolled club, tonight for me at least, will go down as the first time Tom never had something to eat.
so not just me that's notably loud then...you go girl support your lads whatever. Brilliant blog as usual boys :-) x Margate Banshee

A lot has happened this month, good stuff happened, I could never be happier, and among the things I enjoyed are this month's lifestyle favorite.
Slim-fit Lizzy Mango dark jeans. Why? They're the most comfortable pair of Jeans I've wore in a long time, they're the perfect color that goes with everything, and they're slim fit, so they elongate your legs like nothing else. They're just perfect, but an old model and they discontinued the production of it.
Black Converse. Again it goes with everything and very comfortable. There is no reason why it shouldn't make it to the list.
Tory Burch crossbody bag. It's compact, affordable, cute and it does what is asked of it. Black and petite, and easy to grab and go. It fits my cellphone, money, cards, tissue paper and my lip balm, everything I need.
Inglot Hd foundation. I think I should do a complete review on this foundation, it's my holly grail of
Inglot concealer. Same as the foundation, I swear by it. It's high coverage and thick, but once you set it with powder you forget you're wearing makeup. Amazing.
SINNLIG for Ikea. I've been burning it constantly this past month, it smells incredible and fills the whole house with the amazing scent of Apples, It screams spring, plus the color the amazing.
Spinach. Anything spinach, raw, cooked, shredded, or whole. My favorite recipes are the Mini Spanakopita Triangles Recipe, these are amazing Greek spinach pies, and fresh spinach salads.
Twinfish OAT choco bars. These are amazing, I've been a fan of oat since I was a baby, but these oat bars are nothing like anything I've tasted before. Plus they're Vegan.
Backtrack. A horror movie - which I'm a fan of - Tells the story of a psychiatrist who has lost his daughter in a car accident, and has been hunted by her memory for the past year, until one day a weird girl comes into his office and reminds him of his deceased daughter, who will change his life for ever.
This past month I've been listening to a playlist of songs on my Youtube channel, and they're are all pop songs that are romantic and touching, some are in English and some are in French but as equally as romantic and beautiful.
Keeping track of what you have in your kitchen is key to saving money when grocery shopping and meal planning.
I've been cooking in my own kitchen for quite sometime, since 2005 when I was living alone in collage, while I don’t consider myself old, thank you very much, I guess I’ve spent a good amount of time in the kitchen.
Even before I moved away from home, the kitchen was one of my favorite places. Whether I was baking with my grandmother or helping my mom prep dinner for our large family, the kitchen was my happy place. And over time, my freezer has become one of my most beloved possessions.
The home freezer, that miraculous invention of the 1940s, it’s been a tool to help me save time, money, and to have a bit more peace of mind. Over the years my home freezer has served me well. Here’s why.
Through freezer cooking, I can stash a variety of home cooked meals and meal components to enjoy at a later date. Currently I have batches of taco meat, bags of cooked chicken, and bags of marinated chicken. These will make some great, quick meals in the month to come, saving me a ton of time, shopping and cooking.
Buying and cooking in bulk can save me a bundle, in part thanks to lower per unit costs on bulk items, but also because we don’t eat out when we have meals ready to go. Freezer cooking helps our family eat well – at home — and spend less. In addition to my homemade meals, I use the freezer to help me stockpile good deals that I see, that might be a great sale on chicken breast. My freezer helps me load up on the items we know we’ll use but don’t want to pay full pop for later on when we have a craving for grilled chicken.
I do feel better when I know we’ve got food in the house. My freezer is my faithful friend in the kitchen. It helps me feed my family well on a budget and pinch hits on dinner whenever I need it to.
Whether you have an itty-bitty fridge freezer or a large deep freeze, it doesn’t help you a whole lot if you don’t know what you have. Often we forget about something so long that we end up chucking it.
Over the years, I’ve learned how to keep a freezer inventory that works for me. It’s pretty simple and involves zero technology. Sure, there are a few apps out there that will help you keep a kitchen inventory, but I find the pen easier than the keypad.
Sometimes it helps to pull things out. Organize while you’re in there, stacking like with like, if you can.
These ticks represent each individual item.You’re basically communicating to yourself and the other cooks in the household the identity and size of every inhabitant in your freezer. So you know what's left in your freezer stockpile.
A pantry is a room where beverages, food, and sometimes dishes, household cleaning chemicals, linens, or provisions are stored.
It's all up to you and your preference, although there are a few essentials for any pantry, I provided you with the common Pantry Foods and their shelf life, check them out.
I have plenty of food around to create last-minute meals, which cuts down on fast food runs. A weekly meal planning is preferable.
I hardly ever have to make a spur-of-the-moment store run, because I have plenty of food on hand and I can make substitutions to use what I have.
The FDA recommends refrigerating or freezing perishable foods right away. Meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, and certain kinds of produce should never be kept at room temperature for more than two hours, or not more than one hour if the temperature is above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. But what about other foods?
Eggs - Yes: You should always refrigerate eggs to prevent the risk of infection from salmonella bacteria.
Butter - Optional : It's recommended to refrigerate butter, and freezing butter if you're not going to use it within one to two days. But many people keep butter in a covered dish outside the fridge. Since it's made from pasteurized milk, it's less likely to grow bacteria.
Tomatoes - No: If tomatoes are kept in the fridge, they lose their flavor. That's because the cold air stops them from ripening and breaks down their cell membranes, giving the fruit that characteristic mealy taste.
Cheese - Yes: Some kinds of cheese, especially soft cheeses such as brie or ricotta, should always be refrigerated. Others, such as pasteurized or aged cheeses like Parmesan, may not need to be refrigerated (but consult package instructions).
I hope you liked this post. Please give me feedback and share with me your tips on inventory tracking.

A clean office makes for a clear head, but who has time to organize with your workload? Setting up systems and sticking to them allows you to work smarter while you work harder. It also gives the impression that you're on top of things. Who wants to leave them standing there while you shuffle through mounds of paperwork to find the one file folder they need?
As with any large project, making a plan is essential to achieving success when it comes to office cleaning. For best results, business men and women should start by identifying what items need to be cleaned, how often they should be cleaned, and where everything should go?
Try to write it down so you don't forget, or at least have headnotes just in case the ideas got lost in your head.
Chances are many of those papers piled high on your desk aren’t of any value to you. As you begin to sort through your stack of papers, begin asking yourself: Do I need this? Why? Where will I look for it when I need it? Then, create a filing system that best fits your needs, and make a point to file future printouts as they are created to keep the problem from reoccurring.
Regardless of where you do the bulk of your work, it’s important to keep distractions at bay. Keep a home office free of distraction by having a designated mail location away from your office space, and encouraging family members to keep the area free of toys, tech gadgets, and anything else that might invite lost time and inefficiency to sneak into your day.
Daily-use items that you’ll likely need throughout the course of a day, like your laptop, pens, planner, and Post-It Notes, all deserve a spot on your desk. Other items, such as tape, stapler, paper clips, and envelopes, should be neatly stored inside your desk. This keeps less-frequently-used items from taking up valuable desk real estate, but ensures that they are easily accessible.
When your favorite desktop background starts getting obscured with icons, it’s time to de-clutter your virtual desktop. File away documents that you’ll need again, and send everything else off to the virtual recycle bin. Not only will you have a much more attractive looking desktop screen, but you will save countless hours searching for your important documents.
One of the biggest pitfalls to organization is finding the time. Invest the time to properly organize your space, so files, supplies, and other items are in an intuitive, easy-to-find place. Once you’ve established a system that works for you, stick to it! Spending a few seconds to return items to a designated spot will help you save lots of time in the long run.
A clean office is vital to the running of a business. It improves productivity, because all items are organized and in their rightful place. It improves creativity and focus.
Keep a closet or basket fully stocked with all of your office cleaning essentials (glass cleaner, dusting spray, microfiber wipes, rubbing alcohol, paper towels, etc).
Give every item in your office a place and keep it there. If you have trouble remembering where things are, label the storage locations.
Clean your office phone frequently by spraying cleaner onto a cloth and wiping that on your phone. Dip a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol to wipe down the dial pad.
Take out the trash frequently and vacuum frequently in areas that people eat. This will help keep the bugs at bay.
Remember to clean behind your furniture as well. That strip of dust and dirt behind your desk betrays an otherwise clean and tidy office.
Please check this free printable office cleaning checklist to help you figure out what you want to clean.
There are many ways and tools to help you organize you office space, here are a few that are essential and affordable:
Binders: If you have piles of papers everywhere, it's probably best to use binder organizers to keep papers from stacking everywhere.
Keyboard organizers: If you don't have a convenient storage space at your disk this keyboard organizer will help you keep your desk clean and tidy.
Card organizers: If you're like me and have a ton of business cards laying around the office then you need a good card holder or go the extra mile and invest in a good rotary business card organizer.
One of the biggest office offenders is piles of paper -- on your desk, on your shelves, and eventually on your floor. It's easy to get busy and start stacking papers to file for later, but before you know it, you have a task that's too big to tackle. The key is to process papers as you go. Set up a system of trays or file folders that are clearly labeled and make it a habit to use them. The same goes for your computer desktop.
Not all work is created equal. You should approach office organization with this two-zone perspective.
Zone 1: Computer work. This is your traditional desktop. You spend most of your time here, knocking stuff out and getting things done.
Zone 2: Non-computer work. This is where you go to do non-computer stuff. It could be the same desk, but simply another area that is cleared of monitors, cords, and chargers. This is where you go when you thumb through documents, use your iPad, sign papers, scan documents, or stamp envelopes.
No matter how clean you keep your workspace, it's going to get messy during the day. That's okay, that means you're working! It's when you keep it messy that things start to become a problem. To make sure this doesn't happen, clean off your desk every evening. All it takes is 5 or 10 minutes to straighten things up, and you'll come to a clean desk every morning, ready to work.
Finally I hope you found this post helpful, it took me a long time to write and search for links that might be helpful for you.
Tell me your favorite strategy to clean and organize your office, and don't forget to spread the word with your friends and family. Thanks.

A major problem for most people is having too much work and not enough time to do it. One solution: fine-tuning your time-management skills. By using your working hours more efficiently, you attack stress on several fronts:
No matter how you juggle your schedule, the number of hours in the day will always remain the same. But it is possible to adjust your habits to buy more time for the things that matter most.
Walking away from a complex task might seem counterintuitive, but breaks can actually make you more productive. Removing yourself from the work environment immediately reduces stress and gives your brain a chance to “catch up.” If you’re working on a hard problem, your subconscious mind will continue working on it even if your conscious mind is trying to relax—which is why sometimes, solutions magically pop into your mind when you aren’t thinking about the problem. Either way, you’ll come back refreshed and in a healthier, more focused mental state for work.
Habits happen naturally after they’re formed—they become a ritual, something you can slip into automatically, something you don’t even have to think about. For example, if you have to update an editorial calendar every day, make it an unconscious habit, sparing you the necessity of remembering it in a desperate scramble. Forming habits is the hard part—a good rule of thumb is to force yourself to commit the action every day, with no breaks from the routine, until it comes naturally.
On average, your brain is able to remain focused for only 90 minutes, and then you need at least 15 minutes of rest. By taking breaks roughly every 90 minutes, you allow your mind and body to renew--and be ready to fire off another 90-minute period of high activity.
For some people, 15- to 20-minute breaks might be tough to pull off, but taking short breaks throughout the day can still help you to refresh your mind and reset your attention span.
Prepare a list that contains all the things you shouldn’t waste your time on – useless tasks, unnecessary meetings, worthless phone calls, and so on. Then place it next to your “to do” list.
This one is fairly counterintuitive; basically everyone says not to check email right away, but I do and find it extremely useful.
Dealing with important issues first thing helps you make quick decisions about whether your day needs to be adjusted to fit in with what everyone else is doing or whether you can proceed with the tasks you already had planned.
No matter how busy you are, there are always “negative spaces” in your day—and these gaps are when you should “multitask.” Try to fill the empty spaces with productive work: On your lunch break, watch a tutorial video or catch up on your emails. On your drive into work, listen to audiobooks or podcasts. During your workouts, catch up on some voicemails or watch a TED Talk. The more you learn and work in these negative spaces, the more you’ll get done overall.
Remember this rule: Tuck it, transfer it or trash it. Quickly glance over every piece of mail and every memo or e-mail message you get. If it looks as if it’s potentially important, file it right away in a folder marked “pending” or delegate it to someone else to take care of. If it’s not relevant or it’s something you’ll never look at again, trash it. Handle your mail the same way at home.
Start your workday right—at home the night before. After dinner, pack your lunch for the next day, while you’re already in the kitchen. Lay out the kids’ clothes and your own and pack your briefcase. Then spend a pressure-free hour or more doing things you enjoy before bedtime.
Try to begin your day the same way. If you work at home, maybe take a short walk before you go to your office. Have a cup of tea or read or meditate before starting your work. An opening ritual will ease your mind, body and soul into the day.
Make sure your time is focused on your one or two top priorities. Ask yourself: “Is this how I want to be spending my time right now?” Remember: you are your calendar. So treat your calendar with respect.
For many of us, cooking dinner every night is a frustrating, time-consuming process, even if you know your way around a kitchen. Here's how I (a self-proclaimed fool in the kitchen) turned cooking from a time-consuming chore into a quick, easy, and delicious process.
Effective menu planning is rewarding in terms of time and money, especially given how little effort it takes. Those who do it well seem to have internalized its rules. The good news: The rest of us can learn, too.
It's whatever way you organize yourself to cook a meal, whether that's breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It is the plan you make before you shop. Some people plan a month in advance, freezing neatly-labeled packets of soup and stew. Others wing it, shopping for that evening's meal at the farmers' market and picking up whatever looks good to them. Meal planning is a really personal thing. What works for you may not work for me. The goal, I think, is to find a process that is both enjoyable and effective.
This may feel like an indulgence, but just let yourself do it. Browse blogs and websites for recipes that look delicious. Hang out on Tasteologie. Pile up some cookbooks and reach for the sticky notes. Get inspired!
Do whatever works for you. Don't get caught up in a system, just use whatever works best and most easily. Personally, I like Pinterest because it's easy to visually browse what I've saved.
This might sound obvious, but it's easy to get caught up in our weeks and forget to ask our households what they would like to eat. I get extra inspired, too, when I feel like I'm cooking a meal as a gift.
Right now, the weather is changeable in many parts of the country. Look at the weather forecast, and try to predict if you're going to be in the mood for soup (or grilled shrimp salad!) on Friday.
One of my best inspirations is my own record of things I've cooked in the past. Take a look at what you were cooking a year ago, two years ago. It's a good way to remember things you used to cook, and still love.
Now that you're getting inspired in what to eat, start a calendar of what you'd like to cook over the
Monday is pasta, Tuesday is fish, Wednesday is tacos. This doesn't work for everyone, but it may be especially helpful for those with kids. See if they want to get involved with planning their favorite tacos one week.
Looked at your recipes and make a shopping list. Some of the meal planning and recipe-saving services let you do this easily, extracting ingredients from the recipes you have saved.
Some folks really like to organize their meals around sales. Is organic chicken a dollar off this week? Or canned chickpeas? Check out your grocery store circular and adjust your meal plan or shopping list a bit.
Most of us have at least some tolerance for leftovers. I regularly cook one or two big healthy casseroles at the beginning of the week and eat off them all week long for lunch. Some people can only eat leftovers for a single night. Either way, try to make your cooking always do double duty. Make a little extra of everything, and if you don't want it right away, freeze it.
Wash and dry lettuce. Chop onions. Roast vegetables. Brown sausage for pizza. Shred zucchini for quick stir-fries. Stack up glass containers of prepped ingredients in the refrigerator and bask in your own awesome preparedness.
Going beyond prep, cook components of the meals. For instance, start a batch of tomato sauce while you wash greens and prep squash. The sauce can go on pizza one night, and in lasagna the next. Or roast a chicken right then that you can eat that night and use for sandwiches and pasta the rest of the week.
The freezer is your friend. Actually, it's the friend of future you. Make a double batch of that sauce mentioned above and freeze half for later. Make a double batch of soup, stew, chicken cacciatore, cooked beans, throw it in the freezer. Let a month go by, and those leftovers will look fresh and tasty!
It's easy to get overwhelmed when your fridge is over-full. Also, things get hidden in the back, lost behind the mustard. Don't let things go bad. Keep your fridge airy and light, with a sensible, realistic amount of food in it. Keep a list nearby of everything in the fridge, especially leftovers, as a visual reminder of what remains to be eaten.
Meals are easier and quicker to prepare if you keep your pantry well-stocked. Don't run out of olive oil at inconvenient moments. Have spices ready to dress up chicken and beans quickly. Keep a lemon and a sheaf of fresh herbs in the fridge at all times.
Download as many copies as you need and keep them around the house to make it easy to keep track of your meal planning. Give me feedback, a tell me down below if there is any concepts and subjects you want me to cover next.
Real food, a term we hear about a lot. If you're someone who's concern about what you put in your mouth like me, then the term Real food matters to you.
A problem you'll face when you're trying to eat healthy and clean is paying to much for grocery, or that's what you're made to think, eating clean doesn't have to be expansive, at all.
There are two components to eating Real Food on a budget. One is learning what foods to prioritize sourcing well, and the other is learning how to manage your kitchen properly to stretch those dollars.
The goal here is to eat a traditional balance of fats by reducing the amount of Omega 6 fatty acids in our diet and increasing the amount of Omega 3 fatty acids. Try to use more coconut oil, butter, and olive oil in your cooking. Whatever you do, eliminate all yellow seed oils like corn oil, vegetable oil, canola oil, etc.
By this, I mean for you to eat meats from humanely raised, pastured animals or wild caught seafood. High quality eggs are trickier to find.
If you’ve done the first two things on this list and still have some wiggle room in your budget, then start buying as many organic fruits & veggies as you can afford. Prioritize buying organic on thin-skinned fruits & vegetables like grapes, peaches, leafy greens, etc. If a fruit or vegetable has a thicker-skin or peel, you can feel safer buying non-organic b/c you can simply peel it and eliminate most pesticides that way.
You may say that in the short term real food is more expensive. So how do we make it work? How do we eat real food on a budget?
This is my no. 1 tip on saving money, because saving money starts at home before going out to the grocery store. Make a list of the grocery you need preferably organized by where things are found in the store.
It’s not necessary to make everything from scratch (unless you want to, which can be fun!). To save money, though, figure out what you spend most on and learn to make THAT.
Store bought breads, Quality condiments like Ketchup or Mayo and Any specialty ingredient you love – Convert one large bag of shredded coconut into coconut milk for smoothies and coconut butter.

“If you shop at the grocery store for tomatoes, potatoes, zucchini, salad greens or strawberries — and who doesn’t? — then you are the perfect candidate for becoming a kitchen gardener,” says Dan Shapley of The Daily Green.
“Growing your own will save you an incredible amount of money — more than $1,200 if you plant all five, according to the analysis of one Maine gardener.”
Not only will this impart tons of flavor to simple meals, you can dry the extra to use year round. MUCH more affordable than buying jars at the grocery store.
Get the hubs to watch the kids for a few hours while you prep snacks to keep in the freezer. Here are 20 Grab-and-Go Snack Recipes.
Beans are a great way to add bulk to meals, but if you’re an idealist like me you want them properly soaked. Problem is, I often forget to take them out the night before to get the process started. Meal planning is one way to help, but an even simpler way is to have them ready to throw into the pressure cooker. Not sure what to do once they’re prepped? The bean recipes in Eat your beans post are my family’s favorites.
Make and freeze these banana walnut muffins (if the cost of walnuts is an issue omit them – the muffins will still be great!)
I’m not sure I can commit to NO shopping, but with my new freezer packed full, I’m excited to see how little I can spend by eating the food I already have.
I do love eggs and bacon for breakfast, but in a effort to save money, it doesn’t make sense to “pair meat with cheese, eggs with cheese, meat with eggs, and the like unless I’m cooking up something special.”
Don’t get me wrong, I do love some wilted kale or steamed asparagus (both with butter, of course), but I just know they don’t pack as much nutritional punch as high quality fat and meats. BUT, to save money without gorging on tons of grains, a big serving of veggies (smothered in fat and accompanying my protein) is a great way to fill your tummy.
I swore I would never do this (it always seemed so tedious), but now I can see how planning the week’s meals in advance will save us from those last minute restaurant lunches or expensive trips to the grocery store. I will share my meal plans in the coming weeks so we can compare notes.
We save up unused vegetable parts and uneaten leftovers to make hearty broths and soups each week, use chicken bones to make gravy and broth. This way, I can generally get four meals out of each chicken!
I hope you found this post helpful and rich in advice, this is what I do usually and it helped me a lot in saving money through out the week.
I will give you 13 ways to deal with them with no sweat, these ways have helped me since I was 17, when I figured them out, some of them I have retained through life and personal experience, some were given to me as an advice from people I look up to ,either way I feel these will help you as they helped me ALOT.
Don’t enable others to take advantage of you by making excuses for them. The more you value yourself, the less time you spend with people who don’t value you. If you make excuses to spend time with toxic people, you might have to evaluate some of your own issues. You might be dealing with a lack of self-esteem, which is attracting others of the same nature.
While you may find it incredibly easy to chop down the lies and baggage that toxic people pile on, restrain yourself from getting involved. It isn't necessary to validate anything that is being questioned because you know the truth.
This one may seem obvious, but it requires the most pro-activity. Just because you’re in a work or home environment, doesn’t mean you have to engage with that person. If it’s someone you’re very familiar with, like a spouse or co-worker, you probably have learned some of their behavior habits, which makes him or her more easily predictable. So, in the future, think rationally about when you need to engage and when you can walk away.
Toxic people are very negative and like to spread negativity amongst the people that they encounter. The saying that misery loves company is very true. When you encounter toxic people, do your best to raise your positivity levels and list the reasons why your life is worthy of more.
Maintaining an emotional distance requires awareness. You can’t stop someone from pushing your buttons if you don’t recognize when it’s happening. Think of it this way—if a mentally unstable person approaches you on the street and tells you he’s John F. Kennedy, you’re unlikely to set him straight. When you find yourself with a coworker who is engaged in similarly derailed thinking, sometimes it’s best to just smile and nod. If you’re going to have to straighten them out, it’s better to give yourself some time to plan the best way to go about it.
When it comes to toxic people, fixating on how crazy and difficult they are gives them power over you. Quit thinking about how troubling your difficult person is, and focus instead on how you’re going to go about handling them. This makes you more effective by putting you in control, and it will reduce the amount of stress you experience when interacting with them.
No person who hurts others is happy with themselves. By verbally beating others up, toxic people actually batter their own selves. Their external toxicity is the symbol of how they treat themselves. The pain you feel after their remarks is lesser than the pain and misery they have to live with every hour of their lives. Be compassionate, therefore; this kind of understanding and attitude will help you to be less affected by their words and actions.
You shouldn’t have to go at it alone. Besides, gaining outside perspective is always a good idea. Sometimes even simply talking out the situation with someone can foster a solution to your lingering problem. Someone might be able to see a solution that you can’t because they are not as emotionally invested.
Trust me, toxic people are experts in arguments. They will quickly bring you down if you attempt to over-smart them with arguments.
Don't be tempted to bend the rules or change who you are as an individual. Always be yourself and be proud of it. Own it! Never shy away from what you believe in and do not allow others to make you feel less than who you are.
Make yourself seem too busy to give them your time. Keep finding ways to get busy and keep excusing yourself from having to talk to them. You can even make it obvious that it’s an excuse, for they don’t value your time anyway so you shouldn’t care if it’s an urgent business or not.
Patience really is a virtue and moreover it's an attribute that you must have when dealing with difficult people. Stay calm and do not get overly emotional. With patience comes wisdom.
Seek comfort in prayer. Pray for your ability to restrain from adding to the toxicity and pray for the people who feel the need to bring misery upon themselves and others. It's easy to write people off but it's important that you pray for them - as there may be a deeper underlying issue.
Finally, I hope you found these advice helpful, and somewhat assuring that everything is going to be okay in end.

I've started a new series on my blog to start decluttering and cleaning the house, the car and the office.
Maybe you may not think you have much to declutter, but you do. I do. I went into working on this post thinking that I didn't have much left to declutter -- but, boy was I wrong! Maybe you have SO much you don't know where to start. So, follow along and you'll soon discover the joy of decluttering -- just be careful because you could feel the exhilarating freedom of getting rid of stuff you really don't need!
The first step is to ask yourself 10 question about each item, it may take time, that's why at the end I'm going to give a schedule to declutter your entire house, so bare with me.
You only need to follow along and your house will be decluttered completely in 30 days, how easy and simple.
Please tell me if there are any special topics you want me to cover on this series down below. Thank you!

You can get ready for a situation like that by building a network of friends, relatives, and neighbors you can call on to watch your kids. Try taking turns watching a friend’s children so when either of you needs help on short notice you can call the other. If you know responsible adults who don’t have kids, offer to mow their lawn, run an errand, or take care of their house or pet when they are out of town.
It depends on the maturity and abilities of each child. Of course, you should never leave an infant or young child alone or unsupervised. They need to be old enough, mature enough, and capable enough to be safe and to get help if they need it. Here are things to consider:
There are a couple of ways you can search for parenting classes and other services in your area - search for Programs in Your County or call 2-1-1.
I want my organization - company, church group, service organization, etc. - to get involved in preventing child abuse. What can we do?
There are a variety of things you and your organization can do to help prevent child abuse. Check out your options in How You Can Help.
April is Child Abuse Prevention Month. Learn how you can help support child abuse prevention efforts in April and year-round. Also, check out this year's activities on Facebook and Twitter.
You can't tell by looking. Child abusers can be from any ethnic group or income level. While most adults don't abuse children, an abuser is usually a person the child knows, such as a parent, neighbor, or relative.

Listen to your children if they say they don't feel comfortable around someone and let them know they can talk to you about anything.
Tell your kids to say "no" and “get away,” and to tell you right away if anyone tries to touch or hurt them. Tell your children to talk to you or another responsible adult such as a teacher or grandparent.
Teach your kids the difference between a good secret, like a surprise party, and a bad secret, like something that makes them uncomfortable. Make sure your kids understand that it’s ok to tell bad secrets.

You are not alone. Everyone needs help sometimes and there's help out there for you. Take a look at what's available in your community.
If you suspect abuse, you should report it. Do not try to investigate the situation yourself. In Texas, call 1-800-252-54001-800-252-5400 or report online at www.TxAbuseHotline.org.
Give a time-out. Experts say this helps everyone calm down. Make sure the length of time-out matches the age of the child (3 minutes for a 3-year-old, 4 minutes for a 4-year-old, etc.).
Encourage good behavior. Praise your children when they do something well or follow directions. Give them a pat on the back and point out what they did well.
In 2015, 66,721 Texas children were abused or neglected by their parents or other caregivers, and 171 of them died because of abuse or neglect. [learn more]
No, not in Texas. Punishment becomes abuse if it causes injury. A blow that leaves a mark, bruise, welt, or swelling, or requires medical attention probably would be considered abuse.
There are different types of neglect. Neglect includes failing to provide for a child's basic physical, medical, emotional, or educational needs. Leaving a young child home alone or unsupervised or failing to provide needed medical care may also be considered neglect. [find out more]
People who abuse their kids often love them, but many things can lead them to do things they regret. Things like trouble managing stress, lack of parenting skills, or drug or alcohol abuse can all be factors that contribute to child abuse. Read more about why people abuse children on this website.

" Israel’s violence against Palestinians is both gendered and racist. Women and children - the victims most usually decried by Western feminists - but also all adult men, both gay and straight, are oppressed by Israel. The violence takes on multiple forms, but pervades every aspect of the lives of all Palestinians. Women are targeted as the mothers, sisters or wives of present and future “terrorists”.

Tcha! I lost my breath there. I guess you too would have, unless otherwise you happen to be Ajay Thakur. But if you are Ajay Thakur, you can probably read this entire column in a single breath. Ajay Thakur is capable of this because he has no lungs.
Okay, that is an obvious lie. Ajay Thakur is capable of this because he is the star raider for the Chennai franchise kabaddi team, Tamil Thalaivas, and when you watch him in action, you may, well, also forget to breath.
He has been in great form, and it was such a treat to watch this quicksilver player in action at the ongoing Pro-Kabaddi Season-5 at the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium in Chennai, which many sports lovers will remember to be the historic venue for many memorable film-related functions.
With Ajay Thakur leading from the front, you will guess Tamil Thalaivas to be leading the league, and your guess will fetch you ‘minus 5’ points as that question had negative marking for wrong answers.
Tamil Thalaivas are actually bottom-placed, but despite the local team not doing well, it was great fun to be at the stadium this week as enthusiastic fans kept the spirit up in the stands, especially when one zealous chap held a placard that read in bold-letters: “Welcome back CSK”.
Since the placard-holder, a youngster in his mid-teens, was not very far off from where I was sitting, I went up to him and asked why was he showing his support to CSK in a kabaddi match, and his response was, “I am just accompanying my elder brother here. I like kabaddi. But I like cricket more. I am looking forward to watching CSK next year”. We know ‘Knowledgeable Chennai Cricket Fans’ come in various forms. Just that this one came wrapped as a kabaddi fan.
Talking of cricket, kabaddi has a problem that cricket also faces. It is a problem that NBA teams also faced: The names for franchise teams. They are all uniformly silly and hideous. In the Pro-Kabaddi league there is a team named Patna Pirates. Why would any one want that name? Sounds less a kabaddi team, more a collective reference to Lalu’s family.
Then there is U Mumba. This name was probably accepted because every other bad name was already taken. The Gujarat franchise is called Gujarat Fortune Giants, which, of course, sounds a whole lot agreeable when you compare it with Rising Pune Supergiant (nee Rising Pune Supergiants). But for us in this city to take potshots at other teams’ names is a bit rich, especially since our football team is called: Chennaiyin FC. (Fun fact: Chennaiyin FC won the title in 2015 by the cunning stratagem of distracting the opponents with its name).
But the Pro-Kabaddi league stands out for one thing that is increasingly rare on most other sporting fields: Players’ honesty. Most of the kabaddi players when they know that they have been touched, they voluntarily put their hand up to signal that they are indeed ‘out’. This was a surprise for me, for I have been majorly exposed to cricket where players like Shane Watson don’t mind referring the decision to the third umpire even when they are actually clean bowled.
The Pro-kabaddi league has given the sport an exciting edge. The matches are snappy, the raids are fun, and they have tweaked a few rules, brought in new ones, like the ‘do-or-die raid’, ‘super raid’, and going forward we hope they will also include the most revolutionary rule ever seen with regard to kabaddi, which we saw in the film Ghillie: the team that had lost in the semis to makes it to the finals. (Of course, in the universe of Tamil films, kabaddi is the most forward-looking of sports, achieving what most sports have failed so far in real life: pitting man against woman in the same contest).
Talking of films, the brand ambassador of Tamil Thaliavas did not turn up for even one match. Just as well. Because Kamal Haasan is the brand ambassador. Frankly, we can all agree TN had reached critical mass in Kamal events long back this season.
One more occasion of him holding forth with a mike in his hand, even Ajay Thakur would have quickly let out his breath with an audible sigh.

Pine Ridge offers a unique opportunity to buy land at a reasonable cost in the wonderful horse country around Southern Pines. This is the best value in years when it comes to owning land with direct access to the Walthour Moss Foundation. Several of the tracts at Pine Ridge even have frontage on one of the two lakes in the community!! Pine Ridge has a small common area that is open to all property owners. The common area is 2 acres and can be used for schooling or lessons. This area is for the owners to mold as they see fit. We envision it as a place where you can meet and ride with your friends. Downtown Southern Pines is just a short 5 or 10 minute drivefrom Pine Ridge, depending on which route you take. The closest feed store is 5 minutes away at most, and the closest grocery store is about 10 minutes away.

After you have plotted a waveform, you can left-click on the waveform node-title label at the top of the graph window which will set a cursor cross-bar and with popup a new floating window with the cursor position information.
Move your pointer over the new cross-bar and a number "1" will appear. If you now left-click the number that is showing you will be able to move along the graph and position the cursor.
If you click again over the node-title label then you will get the second cursor (ie. the cursor number 2) which will give the absolute value at each cursor position and the difference between the two cursor positions in the popup information window.
The SMA connector(SubMiniature version A) is a 50 ohm coaxial connector. It is visually similar to an F type connector that is commonly used for audio/video communication, but has different dimensions, mechanical properties and is used for different applications such as RF communications up to 18 GHz. Due to its construction, SMA connectors provide a strong and durable connection that minimizes reflections, limiting attenuation, and makes it a great choice when working with microwave frequencies.
The SMA male connector is identified by inside 1/4″-36 threads and a 5/16″ hex nut. A standard polarity connector will have a male pin.
The SMA female connector is identified by outside 1/4″-36 threads. A standard polarity connector will have a female sleeve.
The RP SMA male connector is identified by inside 1/4″-36 threads and a 5/16″ hex nut. It will not have a male pin, but will have a female sleeve.
The SMA female connector is identified by outside 1/4″-36 threads. A standard polarity connector will not have a female sleeve, but will have a male pin.
For many years, all IT enthusiasts struggle with CD and DVD for system installations, upgrades, recovery or just to test a new release.
Also I was always having problems with GPL, shareware, freeware, IDEs, scripts, and other initiatives that from time to time stop working, or don't support your target distro or go buggy.
I had a hard time dealing with BIOS/EFI/UEFI different standard, brands and approaches to bootstrap your system and startup a selected OS from a block or stream device (ie. HDD, ODD, SSD, etc.)
To make it even more difficult, old BIOS desktops usually make USB option very difficult task (since USB is relatively new in PC world of BIOS devices). So many updated solutions just drop support for old systems, and people like me that like to use old (but as good as new) devices that are neglected by the Y/Z generation, but in some cases are the very best to help many who can not afford continuous updates of hardware (almost every six months), specially for poor countries and community schools. And also to have a positive environmental attitude: reduce, reuse, recycle.
So after many years testing all options available I believe that now I have a stable (and understandable), straightforward solution.
3.1. Now with a clean USB you can just start by resize it using gparted or a win32 partitioning application, so that is about 512MB and leave all the rest as free space.
Notice that you will not need to much space for the first partition because it should hold only the syslinux modules, configuration files and your customization image for background.
3.2. Now create as many new partitions as needed to accommodate each live ISO you will want to boot, but follow this rule: use a round value always larger than the ISO file size. Exemple: for 1.1GB ISO use a 1.5/2GB partition. For a 220MB ISO use a 512MB partiton. For a 640MB use a 1GB partiton. Usually 512MB increments is a good rule, but avoid very tight choices, exemple: for a 1.9GB choose 2.5GB not 2GB. This is just to avoid last minute problems and have to start all over again. Remember, this takes time. But this is not a strict order, try it out if you need to save space
3.3. Remember that DOS only understands 4 primary partitions and on USB only ONE, so you should a good strategy is to create a extended partition and many logical partitions (as many as you wish/need), limited to your USB available space/size, remember that sectors usually are in 512 bytes increments.
4. Format the first partition as FAT (FAT16 not FAT32). Sometimes FAT32 will work, but FAT16 will make first bootloader sector be on the right spot (on sector number 63) or you will hack it with fdisk and more the first sector to position 63.
The bootloader must start on setor 63, which is the physical sector number (or LBA) containing the first sector of the partition (unlike the sector count used in the sectors value of CHS tuples, which counts from one, the absolute or LBA sector value starts counting from zero).
6. Edit the /boot/syslinux/syslinux.cfg and insert the ISO partitions you will create, one by one, following this framework at the end of the file:
Please double check your device location (use df -h) and also check the correct partition to set the X variable of the command, since each partition was made with the size as a critical factor.
Many people are having trouble accessing the old gmail login page as the new login page just plain SUX...
Keep that folder and open a new one (because you will need to return here to set it back to True before you login).
If you forget this last step to enable javascript again the next page will say javascript needs to be enabled but you can choose to use the html version which is just as good.
So choose to use Gmail's basic HTML view, which does not require JavaScript or change back the javascript.enabled to True again and choose "try again".
The new gmail login page sucks and yes Google should listen to all of us bickering about it and change it back.
They said they were making it easier for us to sign in. Bullcrap!!!...it made it harder and more annoying.
Change it back or we all might just quit gmail (ie. look what is happening to youtube - when you don't hear your customers!).
This new sign-in is very annoying to us, costing us time and money. The new page is neither faster or makes it easier or beneficial for the users.
Back when we the user could put the email and password in the same popup container was more user friendly and is more important to keep our privacy.
I believe this is the best solution ever (tested on different Ubuntu base systems with the same problem) for software-center crash bug.
The solution that I have found to solve this bug, after many months of research, and many misleading information found on the web/google/blogs/forums is very simple, but difficult to understand for newbies and non-coders.
CAUTION: The Internet is full of 'false solution' (ie. or very case specific situations) to software-center bug affecting ubuntu users, and that lead to make your system even more corrupted and buggier than before, so please do take your time to understand what you are intending to "sudo" with or you will be in trouble.
After reading around quite a bit on several similar and somewhat related bug reports, the following 2 steps solved it for me (or seem to have solved it for all the systems I could identify with same crash log - which is also misleading - caution reading logs!).
Does not need to purge software-center or upgrade distribution or worst: DO NOT REINSTALL YOUR SYSTEM! Does not have to do with dbus or proxy or hardware problems, these are just side effects.
I diagnosed the problem as a 'pip' bug or 'pip configuration' corruption and its consequence on python subsystem.
So I targeted it as the result of a python 'pip' installation bug after a wrong 'pip' installation of a non standard package repository.
Not only does this solves python exception error with pip upgrade, but also a greater bug of Ubuntu community, which is the software-center crash bug.
Every rechargeable battery has certain number of charge discharge cycles which is specific to its capacity (current output or voltage).
Don't take it to 40% and put it on charge and still keep using it. Battery temperatures can reach around 40°C while you're using your phone with the charger plugged in and that's not good for you battery life.
There are two main types: Lithium ion and Lithium polymer, both are having different chemistries and they are not same. Lithium polymer is light weight and can have more Coulombs* ratings, which means capable of giving more current than lithium ion. Lithium polymer is less likely to die quickly than lithium ion by over charging. But still both lithium ion and lithium polymer can be over charged by leaving charger on.
* The coulomb (unit symbol: C) is the International System of Units (SI) unit of electric charge. It is the charge (symbol: Q or q) transported by a constant current of one ampere (A) in one second (s):
Also turn brightness down, remove from your device unneeded apps and emails, check which apps consume most battery or are get alerts, and in areas of bad reception do a network reset. A lot of battery life especially on iPhones are due to bad upgrade and apps in the background using your resources.
Not only I did setup the printer using only a Linux station with a Mozilla/Firefox browser, but I believe the information on the WEB and also on the "quick start sheet" that comes with the printer (in the box) it not clear about this. You do not need to use CD/DVD or the other paid OS.
For my surprise and exactly what made me choose the EPSON printer was that it is really committed to support GNU/Linux users.
Does EPSON L455 scanner and printer work over wifi without the need of a USB network host computer ?
YES! But you need to install all the packages as describe in the documentation you downloaded, and also configure properly the network, printer CUPS and SANE conf file (all detailed in the documentation).
In less then 30 minutes I figured out (ie. followed the instructions) and was not only printing with quality control but also: scanning documents and changing the network DHCP IP to a fixed IP address using just the a web browser connected to the printer WEB-GUI. And also, don't forget to change the Admin password!
YES! But you need to download and configure from Google Play the EPSON iPrint app. Should work with iPhone too.

[The following is the second in a series of conversations between Antenna contributors regarding the Lifetime drama series UnREAL, which recently completed its first season. See part 1 here, and stay tuned for part 3 on Friday!]
Jason Mittell, Middlebury College: One thing that fascinates me about the show is how it simultaneously dismantles the romantic fantasy peddled by The Bachelor, and offers its own savvy version. Framed by its presentation on Lifetime, the series is targeting female viewers who “know better” than to be duped by conventional reality TV (a savvy attitude that Allison Hearn has argued is core to reality TV fandom). The narrative constructs Rachel as the stand-in for such savvy viewers—and yet makes her the object of desire for both the hunky cameraman Jeremy, and the hunky “suitor” Adam. Despite the fact that her life (and hair) is a total mess, Jeremy finds her hotter than his perky blond fiance, and Adam seems ready to choose Rachel over the line-up of primped and perfected contestants.
If one of the appeals of The Bachelor is the vicarious desire for women to imagine that if only they were in the competition, they could beat out those other shallow boobs for his heart, then UnREAL dramatizes that by putting a viewer surrogate for women who might scoff at such desires behind-the-scenes, and then making her inadvertently beat out all of the shallow boobs. She is the savvy viewer incarnate, and she wins the hearts of the show’s only two attractive straight men by being smarter than the other women, without even showering!
So I’m curious if others found themselves motivated by these romances? Any shippers? Or were you with me, on the sidelines rooting for the show’s purest “romance,” Quinchel?
Melissa Lenos, Donnelly College: I know I’m in the minority with this opinion, but I find the romance elements to be the least interesting part of the show. While I get the structural intrigue of framing a sort of anti-romance within the staged romance of Everlasting, I like the show best when it’s focusing on Rachel’s (and Quinn’s!) character development and motivations and general messiness as a human.
Kathleen Battles, Oakland University: You are not in the minority, Melissa. I also found the romances to be the least interesting parts of the shows, especially Rachel’s. Quinn’s “romance” with Chet was far more interesting, particularly as it was mediated by Quinn’s especially non romantic idea of love.
I also find myself deeply uncomfortable with the idea of “shipping” Quinn and Rachel. I found their relationship to be, as I said on Twitter, the central “romance” of the show—but that is different than shipping. Theirs is a complex relationship of teacher/student, boss/worker, idol/worshipper, etc. I also find the poster above deeply, and hilariously, ironic.
I can’t say how much I enjoyed the last minutes of this show (minus Jeremy’s visit to Rachel’s mother—which I only saw later as my recording clipped the end). The scene of Anna taking her moment (I love how self-aware the contestants were) and claiming something better for herself in her white dress followed by Quinn and Rachel discussing the coming season of the show was wonderful on so many levels. Their spat out “I love yous” were a perfect end. The show is unrelentingly grim, as many have noted, but I find the constant tension between the allure of romance and the realization that it is unattainable utterly compelling.
Phillip Maciak, Louisiana State University: I totally agree with your take on the final minutes of the finale. UnREAL is a show built around this narcotic, corrosive relationship between Quinn and Rachel, their shared competence, its costs, etc. But it was fascinating to me that the season didn’t actually end there and, instead, cut to that seedy bit of business that your DVR mercifully edited out for you. (The cut to Jeremy was even aesthetically disappointing, given that we’d just had that crane shot as a nice visual punctuation mark.) This was a great finale, but I thought that final twist was both a move to the show’s weak side—Margaret Lyons referred to Jeremy as a “humanoid henley”—and an uncharacteristic hedge. That “I love you” exchange, preceded as it was by Quinn’s essential admission of her betrayal and some pointed references to murder, left plenty of questions open for us. We don’t have to be shipping Quinn and Rachel to know that their relationship is both more interesting and more important than any of the erotic relationships on the show. Dredging up an essentially abandoned subplot from earlier in the season—one that was excessive even by this melodrama’s standards—to amp up the stakes seemed both confusing and confused. And so did the shift of focus back (away) to Jeremy, especially in context of Kathleen’s earlier point that the heterosexual couplings mostly serve to shift our gaze to relationships between women. I had kind of hoped we were heading into a glorious season two without either Jeremy or Adam, but Fake Chris Pratt isn’t going away that easy, I guess.
Melissa: That moment in the finale when Rachel says, “I don’t think our audience is interested in girls with jobs” felt like a shout out to those of us watching for the Quinn/Rachel relationship—and watching these women work is so satisfying!—rather than the romance. To me, this was first and foremost a show about a woman who is very good at her job, and sometimes loves her job, but also knows that her job isn’t very good for her. Sound familiar, academics? (I’m 30% joking.)
Myles McNutt, Old Dominion University: I definitely felt the chemistry between Rachel and Adam, but the show has an uneasy relationship with romance—its takedown of Everlasting‘s forward-facing romantic framing is thorough and matter-of-fact, but at the same time it leaned on the love triangle, and although the finale shifts to more complex “romances” like Rachel and Quinn there’s still the reliance on a more conventional romantic thrust when it comes to promoting the show. The original key art for the show somewhat inexplicably featured Jeremy, for example—the key art eventually shifted to Adam (the romantic partner with a clearer link to the themes of the show), but in both cases you see the show leaning on a more traditional Lifetime framing even as the writers showed more interest in other areas.
I feel this is a space the show could evolve in future seasons—the depiction of Everlasting itself ended up very scattershot, and unfocused, and while this is not a show about the contestants, I do feel it’s a space to clarify and focus—and evolve—its position vis-a-vis “romance” as it continues to live and breathe in this world.
Melissa: That’s what I was wondering by the end, Myles—if future seasons will embrace the less obvious—but ultimately more interesting—tensions explored in season one.
Kristen Warner, University of Alabama: I know how y’all feel about the romance function of the series. But I’m here for it! I love the romance genre and all of the many ways that it finds itself deployed in series where it may or may not be warranted (looking at you Homeland and The Good Wife) or may or may not be considered ironic like UnReal. So, yeah—give me all the lingering stares and the angsty dialogue and the flirty banter and the hay rolls and the scorched earth manpain and the romantic jitters. Haters gonna hate.
While I vigilantly tried to remain “shipper agnostic” in my choice of suitor for Rachel for many reasons (my distrust of Marti Noxon one of the biggest with regard to triangles—best not to unpack that 15-year-old-suitcase), it was fun to watch Rachel enact different versions of herself with both men. To Jason’s earlier point, I’m most certain our identification is linked to Rachel (although I have seen a number of women stress how much they wish to be Quinn especially because of the messiness of her relationship with Chet) and that she is indeed the best at making us “normal” girls feel powerful in how she pulls these men folks’ strings. That IS the quintessential essence of good fantasy. I mean, at one point she and one of her men roll around in a bale of hay for Crissakes. They are clearly playing at well-known romance conventions: the “Rustic bodice ripper” versus the “Billionaire English Gent” types to be specific.
My point here is that I don’t think UnReal is necessarily subversive in the way it sells the romance to the consumerable “savvy” viewer; I can think of a host of “new era” romantic comedies that do similar work. However, I do think the show excels in identificatory suture in that it makes it super clear that the things that excite and arouse women aren’t just hard bodies—although say what you want about Jeremy, but between the henley, the clawfoot tub, the glass shower and the log cabin house, I’d find myself at peace, I’m just saying—but that the personas she performs with each of those men are all wonderfully fantastical and immaterial. For me the scene that sums up the moment of meta romantic fantasy is when Rachel discovers that watching the fantasy version of herself and Jeremy on that beach talking about love and their future and (cis, white, hetero) normalcy is what ultimately gets her off after all of her previously failed attempts. Meta because as a viewer watching her watch a fantastical version of herself be happy how different is that from reading the romance novel or watching a soap opera and suturing yourself into it? Not really much difference at all.
Dana Och, University of Pittsburgh: Yes, all of this. That moment of Rachel achieving orgasm finally with that video of her and Jeremy is the indelible moment of the show to me. It is easy to mock the various romance myths being overtly marketed in dating reality shows—though another great moment was the horse riding scene—but this moment cuts to the myths of romance that we spin in our real lives (and then post on Facebook). Smart.
Jason: I totally agree with Kristen that Rachel as savvy romantic heroine has a long lineage in various genres and media, but I’m particularly curious about its articulation to the reality dating show. The Bachelor and its ilk seems to be television’s most unreconstructed site of conventional romantic fantasy, or at least it seems to be to me as an outsider who rarely watches them. As y’all have said, things have gotten (or have been for a long time) darker and more complicated on soaps, Lifetime movies, romcoms, romance novels, and prestige prime time dramas—but not (ironically, I guess) “reality.” Does UnREAL throw down the gauntlet to dating reality shows to acknowledge and complicate the fantasy?
Kathleen: I think the show actually reveals how complex the fantasy already is. If anything, the show doesn’t so much throw down a gauntlet to reality TV as to show how complex the work of building even the most basic fantasy of romance really is. Let’s not forget one of the series writers came from the world of The Bachelor. Here is a show that yes, asks a lot of hard questions, is filled with cynicism, but also keeps reminding us just how damn good Quinn and Rachel are at creating this fantasy world. Sure the fantasy is trite, but this show reminds us over and over again just how much work it takes to make it actually happen.
I really appreciate Kristen and Dana’s points about the ways that the show also includes so many nods to romance beyond reality. The love triangle itself is a pretty well worn trope central to so much fiction aimed at women—as in the various “teams” women can join. This show also plays with the good boy/bad boy set up well (Jeremy/Adam, Dean/Jess, Angel/Spike). I think we see moments where both Rachel—in the wonderful scene discussed above—and Quinn—between getting her ring and catching Chet—submit to the fantasy, even though they are ostensibly savvy.
I also feel like this comment might refer to the above two threads, but in this whole discussion, I just keep wondering why a show needs to be “dark” or “complex” to pass some legitimation test. I think one thing the show perversely does is demonstrate the extreme complexity of managing and running a reality show where unlike a scripted show helmed by the auteur showrunner, producers are forced to make something out of a hodgepodge of events. And though it doesn’t focus on the contestants enough, I think it also demonstrates a range of complex reasoning among the them. Why must we consistently equate “darkness” or “anti-ness” with “complexity” as well?
Jason: One of UnREAL‘s hooks, especially with savvy viewers, critics, and scholars, seems to be the speculation over what we’re seeing is “real” concerning how the reality TV industry works. Knowing that Sarah Gertrude Shapiro worked as a producer for The Bachelor before applying that experience to the fictional world of UnREAL fuels such matters, despite her (assuredly lawyer-mandated) insistence that all actual events and characters are fictional. Whether specific events are fictional or fictionalized versions of real “reality,” there is no doubt that the series captures the underlying realities of reality TV production, where drama is created both on-set and in the edit bays, where casting is as crucial as it is in a Hollywood film, and where savvy contestants are self-aware of their own performances, potential leverage over producers, and possibilities of post-reality notoriety. In other words, nobody involved in making reality TV has any illusions that there is anything “real” happening—and I would argue this extends to a great deal of the audience as well.
Thus the series serves a pedagogical function, teaching viewers how to watch reality TV with an expanded understanding of what might be happening behind the scenes. Although I’ve read enough about reality TV that I felt sufficiently savvy, I was surprised by the role of “reality fluffers” like Rachel, working off-screen to heighten drama and point characters in the “right” direction. This pedagogical impulse interests me in large part because I’ve decided to teach the first season as the semester-long case study for my Television and American Culture course next spring. It will replace Homeland‘s first season, which I’ve used three times before—while Homeland worked well to teach serial narrative, explore premium television’s industrial strategies, and raise issues around representations of nation, gender, race, and religion, it has grown a bit tired for me. UnREAL allows more conversations about the meta representation of television itself, foregrounds questions of genre, and most importantly, highlights how television can be “worth” teaching beyond the elite realm of HBO/Showtime (and I know some of my bro-ier students will squirm productively at watching Television For Women!).
So how do the rest of you view the series pedagogically? How might you teach it productively? And how would you deal with inevitable questions that students will ask about “how real is it?”
Dana: I would pair it with Big Brother (a show that actually does have a very short window between events happening and then being constructed into storylines and aired, as well as one live show a week), Big Brother After Dark (“You will not talk about production” bellows over the loudspeaker endlessly while we watch unedited live feeds of “houseguests” eating pudding and talking about stubbed toes), and the final episode of The Hills. These texts offer a range of reality show examples for how the construction of the “real” is already visible and open to interrogation, not to mention the ways that these discussions of manipulation are part and parcel of audience investment, discussion, and resistance (in particular with the racism scandal unveiled and mainstreamed by Twitter users during #bb15 but visible in banal ways daily on Big Brother live feed, Twitter, YouTube, Tumblrs, blogs, and message boards). A quick peek at the #bb17 hashtag on Twitter will reveal lots of fans talking not only about how CBS shapes narratives for the three hours per week of televised shows, but also the “houseguests” misconceptions about playing to the audience. If so much of the denigration of soap operas and reality television is wrapped up in the projection of a naive and unsavvy feminine audience, a consideration of online discussions and artifacts could complicate and—gasp—maybe even dispel some of the horror at being aligned to Television For Women.
Phil: I’m with Dana. For me, I think the pedagogical value lies, not necessarily in its journalistic expose of how the sausage gets made, but rather in its up-front visualization of the constructedness of the “reality” space. I teach a course called “Multimedia Realisms,” for instance, and I think the pilot at least will be able to serve as a zippy introduction to the labor of manufacturing a documentary aesthetic during the weeks when we discuss Reality TV and its single-camera comedy offspring. The thing I like about it, though, is less in the way it explicitly teaches us about the genre (here’s how we do the talking heads, here’s how the narrative comes together, etc.) than in the way that it frames that mediation visually. For example, I love how many screens this show has constantly zipping in and out of frame—the dailies, the surveillance cameras, even the iPhones—and I look forward to having students literally name and peel away the layers as we move into discussions of texts for which those layers are not so readily visible.
Melissa: There was a moment early on—it’s after Adam cuts Britney—when Quinn walks down a wall tearing down a timeline with pieces like, “Britney hogs Adam at the Ballroom Dance, Britney ruins Pepper’s first kiss with Adam”—she’s making the point that they’ve already structured the entire season (before the second episode!) around the “character” Adam has just cut. Quinn is adamant that—above all other “types”—they must have a villain for the program to work. The wall has other things written on it—scheduled catfights and skinny dipping sessions—and when I first saw this scene, all I could think of was how I can’t wait to use it when I talk about narrative structure in any of my classes—media studies, film or literature-based. In the past, with first-year students, I’ve used the basic structure of Cinderella (and the old Classroom Jedi trick of having them try to name a story that isn’t basically some version of Cinderella)—I think a few screenshots of Quinn’s timeline could do a lot of that same work … while also fulfilling all of the same Cinderella narrative arc-points.
From episode 1.2, Quinn shows how “we built a whole season around Britney,” not accounting for her getting voted off in the first episode.
I am still in Canterbury. This week I completed one of my courses on the Resurrection Narratives (the stories of the resurrection of Jesus in the four Gospels and 1 Cor 15). I am still teaching the other three plus a once weekly adult ed session.
The weather actually turned quite warm for two days this past week, but as I am sure you can guess from the title of this entry, it is cold again.
A group of people asked me to do a day of reecollection on the Holy Spirit as a preparation for the feast of the Pentecost. There were 28 participants, and I think it went quite well. I spoke especially of how difficult it is to get an accurate picture of the Holy Spirit, but that is OK, because the Spirit is so much more than we can picture or define. I also spoke of discerning what the Spirit wants of us, and also of the gifts of the Spirit and how we are to use them.
Please keep our friars in Kingston, Jamaica in your prayers. Things are always very violent there, and it seems as if the country is finally trying to address (which in the short run means extreme violence). The friars are outside of the city, but there is always a certain amount of danger in situations like this.
We have fixed the glitches with the daily reflections and I hope it will smooth sailing from no on. The next part of the project that I am going to address is to work on getting more spiritual reading reviews. The purpose is to give the friars a chance to give their recommendations on spiritual reading to whomever might read this site.
I finished two works this week. The first is called the Last Empress by Anchee Min. It is about the last empress dowager in the Chinese empire. It takes the story from her point of view. From the western point of view, she is always seen as a dragon lady. Yet, from the inside you see the tensions with which she was contending (family, national, international). It is easy reading and quite a good book to get an insight into that era of Chinese history (from 1860 - 1905).
The second work is a series of courses from the teaching company on the Greek and Persian Wars by John Hale. This covered the period from around 500 B.C. until the death of Alexander the Great. For history buffs, this was pure gold. The teacher has an excelent, exciting presentation style. I was quite impressed.
I am still in Canterbury. I am teaching four courses here, one of which I will finish next week. The other courses will run until I return to the States for the second session of our Provincial Chapter on June 11th.
The weather is slowly improving. It has gotten to 20 centigrade (I think that is around 70 farenheit). The countryside is magnificent. Everything is so green. Now, the cost for that is frequent rain, but there is always a price to pay.
I have added a few adult ed classes on scripture study for those who wish to attend. The first class last night was on the book of revelation. It was a two hour class, and we had about 25 attend. I was very pleased.
I have to apologize. We have had a technical glitch in our podcasts of scripture reflections. I hope that it will be fixed today.
Great Britian has a coalition government. It actually seems quite peaceful here. I am sure it is only a honeymoon, but it is good to hear it after weeks of election polemics.
I have finished two books this week. The first was a history of Julius Caesar by Jacob Abbott. He is an author from the turn of the century (C. 1900) who wrote a series of reflections on historic figures. It is not the most insightful book, but it gives the basic details. I always find that whenever I read history, I pick up something for by understanding of Scripture.
The second was a biography of Erasmus by Johan Huizinga. First of all, I was thrilled to read something by this author. I had read a book of his, The waning of the Middle Ages, when I was in the seminary in a course taught by Fr. Roger Haas. That was the first course that I realized how much our views of history can be influenced by the point of view of the author. Furthermore, Erasmus was a central figure in the development of the Renaissance. He studied and published critical editions of many Greek and Latin manuscripts, including a critical edition of the Greek New Testament. Many of his ideas were considered to be controversial, and some consider his a forerunner of the Protestant reformation (although he remained a Catholic until the day he died). The book was well done. Especially appreciated were a series of his letters which were included with the text, including a long description of St. Thomas More. The irony behind this book is that I picked it up at a store called Ollies, which is like Big Lots. Who else but I would have bought a book like this at Ollies?
I am still in Canterbury teaching my courses. I have students from great Britain, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Cameroon,and Nigeria. It is always a challenge/blessing to teach such a diverse group. It makes you take stock of what is universal belief and what is culturally determined. So much of what we think is right and wrong is simply the way that we are used to doing it.
I will be giving a few adult ed classes as well over these coming weeks. People are so hungry for scripture that wherever I go, they ask for additional instruction.
One sister asked me to look over a short book that she has written. Again, it is privilege to help someone who is just starting out to write. I have been so blessed in that apostolate that I feel a strong obligation to help anyone who is starting out.
The weather is cold, cold, cold. We have gotten close to freezing a couple of night this week. It is supposed to warm up a bit at the end of the week.
I met a class mate of mine from Rome (back in the early 80's) who now lives in Canterbury. We did Bible studies together at the Biblicum (which, if you have ever been to Rome, is a few blocks from the Trevi Fountain). It was great to see him again after all these years.
I finished one book: England under the Tudors by Arthur Innes. I have always been fascinated by that era of history: Henry VII, his son Henry VIII, and then three of his children: Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth. These were not always the nicest of people, but they reigned in England at a crucial time when England was transformed from a backwater second class power to the ruler of the seas. Henry VIII comes across as talented, crafty, cruel, even paranoid and autocratic. Elizabeth is seen as great, and yet indecisive and devious.
I finally made it to Canterbury. Our Franciscan Institute is situated about a 20 minute walk outside of the old city walls. Canterbury is a beautiful tourist town. I went down there last Friday and it was packed with students from France and Germany on their Spring break. It almost has the spirit of Assisi in terms of taking one back to earlier times.
I was originally to teach two courses this term. (They divide the school year into three ten week terms, this term being called Trinity Term because Trinity Sunday falls in it.) The courses were an introduction to the New Testament and the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark and Luke) and Acts. Just before arriving, I got some bad news. One of the OFM friars, Shamus, had a mile heart attack and I was asked if I could cover another two courses: Introduction to the Old Testament (Mostly for adult ed learners) and a seminar on the Resurrection Narratives (the stories of what happened when Jesus rose from the dead in the Gospels and First Corinthians). I teach Monday to Thursday, which gives me a good weekend to work on writing projects and to visit the sites.
Please keep Fr. Shamus in your prayers. His heart attack has turned out to be quite a bit more serious than they first thought.
The weather is just what I remembered it to be when I was here two years ago: cool and cloudy, almost gloomy. It should clear up in a couple of weeks.
The big excitement here is a general election in Great Britain tomorrow. There are three major parties, and it is possible that none of them will win an outright majority, which would mean a coalition government.
I finished one book: the second volume of the Memoirs of General W.T. Sherman. This volume went from his conquest of Atlanta (during the Civil War), he burning of a fifty to hundred mile swath to the Sea, and then the end of the war and the aftermath. Most of it is good reading, but he gets very defensive about two issues. The first is his march to the sea. He destroyed everything in his sight. His theory was that war is hell, and it would end sooner if people felt the consequences of their choices. Yet, he struggles to build a defense for actions that today we would consider war crimes. The other section in which he becomes defensive is his treatment by the Secretary of War at the end of the war. The Secretary of War released some information to the press that put Sherman in highly unfavorable light. He is very, very touchy about that, and he probably had a right to be.
The first place the vast majority of consumers turn for information on local businesses is the Internet. That means your customers and prospects are looking for you online, from their laptops as well as tablets and mobile devices. In other words, your business needs to be online. Whether you have a website that needs to be improved, or don’t yet have a website, be sure to apply these 10 tips to help you get the website your business needs and de­serves.
In order for search engines to understand what’s on your page and better connect you to potential visitors, you need to have your most important information (keywords) included in your website. These typically are embedded during the meta-tagging process in the following three key areas:
• Title Tag: descriptive, keyword-rich and specific – tags are major contributors to ranking and should be less than 65 characters long
• Meta Description: keyword-rich – this explains what the website is about and helps click-thru rates
You’ll want to wrap these keywords naturally into your copy, since your website should appeal to human visitors first, search engines second. Keywords to consider:
• Your company name and key people, such as “John Johnson, plumber” and “Johnson and Smith Plumbing Company, Dallas”
• Products or services your business offers, such as “plumbing,” “child care,” “oil changes” or “wedding cakes”
• The geographic area you serve, such as “San Jose, California,” “Twin Cities metro” or “greater Cleveland”
• Phrases customers may search for, such as “car wash coupons,” “Minneapolis dry cleaner,” “free roofing estimates” or “Phoenix estate attorneys
Make it easy for visitors to contact you. Display your phone number prominently at the top and bottom of every page. Include your email address and possibly your physical address in the footer (the bottom bar) of every page. Be sure to create a “Contact” page that includes all the above information, plus a map, directions, hours of operation and possibly a form visitors can fill out for more information.
Save the smiley faces and animated graphics for emails to your friends—your website should have a professional look that matches your brand. Use colors that go with your logo colors; choose one or two fonts and use them consistently across the site; make sure graphics or photos complement each other and look professional. If in doubt, keep it simple.
A “call-to-action” refers to text on your website that invites visitors to do something. Clear calls-to-action get visitors to take the next step and go from just looking at your website to contacting your business. Calls-to-action could include:
Most people just scan the information in websites rather than read it top to bottom, start to finish. Make pages simple to scan by remembering an “F” pattern—put important content across the top of the pages and down the left side. Also, use bold headlines and subheads to make information easy to scan.
Navigation tabs or buttons should be consistent across every page. As mentioned above, you’ll want to position navigation using the F-shaped reading pattern, with buttons, links or tabs running across the top or left side of the page. Also be sure to:
It should look something like “Home> Catalog> Product #1”, giving visitors an easy way to backtrack.
Think of a newspaper — the biggest stories are on the top half of the page, or “above the fold.” Your website should do the same. According to a recent Nielsen report, 80% of site visitors won’t scroll down the whole page, so make sure the important info is near the top:
Make it clear what visitors should do – calls-to-action, that include your number, a contact form, and maybe an option to download information, etc. Keep in mind that “above the fold” is a moving target with the increase of mobile and tablet use, but it’s still critical in website design.
If your site takes more than a few seconds to load, visitors may abandon it and go to a competitor’s site instead. You can help ensure the site loads quickly by keeping image sizes low (but still of good quality) and limiting the number of videos, widgets, photos and social media sharing buttons embedded in the site.
Your website should help potential customers get to know you and trust your work. To help build credibility, include samples of your work on the site; testimonials from happy customers; links to newspaper or magazine articles that have featured your business; any awards you’ve received; and logos of any local organizations you belong to, such as the Chamber of Commerce.
Whether your customers are consumers or other businesses, connecting with them on social media is a great way to spread the word about your products or services, as well as increase traffic to your website. You’ll want to know on which social networks your target audience spends their time. Here’s a quick rundown of the most popular sites:
• Facebook – still reigns as the largest social site and offers opportunities to nurture relationships and target ads
• Twitter – great for communicating real-time news, assisting with customer service and supporting event coverage
• LinkedIn – serves as largest network for businesses and professionals and is ideal for building relationships, partnerships and hiring
• YouTube – the largest video-sharing site provides a place to easily share your expertise, tips and behind-the-scenes company videos
• Google+ – a growing networking site that has a link to a company’s Google+ account is a good way to influence shares
• Pinterest – one of the most visual social sites with a female-oriented member base. Great for retailers and other highly visual businesses.
• Instagram – great for showcasing your company with stylized images and videos. Perfect for businesses in hospitality, retail and entertainment.
• SnapChat – one of the newest kids on the block, this social app allows users to share short-lived photo and video messages.
Bottom line, all websites have a call-to-action, even if it is to click on the next link or read the next page. Is your call-to-action getting you results?

I'm fascinated by cities. I lived in Plymouth for 3.5 years and in London (not Essex) for about 5 or so. I loved them both in different ways, though comparing Plymouth to London feels vaguely ridiculous.
Anyway, discussions of definitions of city should be left for another day. I want to think about what makes a city smart. This post was prompted by catching an update on how London cabbies are using social media to update each other and how the network has grown from the 2 cabbies who hatched the plan, to the 400 they currently have registered. As an aside here, this led me via the Twitter account to the website for tweetalondoncab which makes my eyes want an eye bath quick smart but lets not cast aspersions where strengths evidently do not sit. I've got more chance of voluntarily wearing mascara than passing the knowledge.
Park that thought for a moment (ha ha ha, *donk*) and move instead to the the Victorian sewerage tunnels underneath London. A ready made duct system, which combined with the underground subterranean rivers beneath London, covers hundreds of miles hidden away beneath feet, little thought of, but much relied upon.
Then there's the obvious. The tube. Or rather, the tube and its little brother, the post office railway, the combination of which cover approximately 270 miles of track and are the object of obsession ranging from being able to name the location of every station on the network to photographing every 'ghost' station.
So how is this relevant? From Traffic Wardens to bus drivers, cabbies to sewerage, to me what makes a city smart is not how many networks of varying descriptions a city actually has, but how those are used. Perhaps back in the days of the Industrial Revolution having an asset such as sewers was a sign of a forward thinking city but these days our assessment of a city fit for purpose revolve more around its ability to host an Olympics and how many wi-fi access points it contains.
But these are distractions. In the same way we are all learning to hijack each others networks, to essentially buy our way into the value other peoples networks contain, in which we value the networks people bring to their jobs, we should value a city on its ability to utilise the existing networks within a city.
Take for example, the Highways Agency traffic cameras used to inform networks where traffic incidents were without needing to be on the scene or rely on someone being at the scene taking the initiative to inform someone. What a waste to only have authorised eyes accessing such information - why not distribute not only the access but also the responsibility for monitoring issues on such cameras out to the local people who have to pass by those places monitored by the cameras each morning on their way to work.
Intelligent cities enable dual or even triple use, and they distribute responsibility to the masses.
Then there are those cabbies. Cabbies get everywhere and they get paid to go everywhere more to the point, though if Londoners are to be believed they go everywhere that is North and nowhere that is South (and my personal experience after being evicted from La Scala at 4am and attempting to get to Dulwich bear this out). What do those cabbies see in the process of their journeys across the metropolis? Do they see the patterns above ground that those who traverse the same paths day to day can only see? Do they see the errors in those patterns, the missing person from the always standing there who wasn't supposed to be on holiday this week? Or the phase change, even, in the traffic lights around gyratories which perhaps wasn't planned?
Intelligent cities take advantage of the familiar and predictable and enable error reports to be made instantly and easily.
Sewers. An unfortunate necessity in the ever more clean and surgically detached digital 21st century. We don't like to think about them, we don't like to talk about them. But what could they tell us if we sent nodules down there with sonar capabilities which bounces and bounced and mapped the landscape above them, between the tunnels and the streets, so that engineers would not need to consult ridiculous amounts of land registries and wait for the data to arrive - instead they could communicate this to those who require it, the utility companies, who would never again accidentally slice through, perhaps, the cable that they did not know was there.
Crime. Cities are crime hot spots - so many people and so much to steal. So many tourist too busy gazing open mouthed to notice the brushing too close and the hasty getaway. Above all cities now, layers of connectivity in the form of 3G, or of free wireless, or as Google has shown, open routers, all keys to the door of location. Reporting crime, or even accident often starts with 'where are you?' for how else will assistance reach you and how many of us are 100% confident that we could fire back an answer immediately, if at all? So no system to hit a button on a mobile and triangulated instantly, transmit that data to the nearest ambulance control centre, to be recorded, linked and assistance despatched while the controller on the other end of the phone deals with the weird intimacy of preventing death before assistance arrives.
The potential for expanding the IQ of a city does not require any physical expansion. We do not need more houses, greater history, more majors nor faster connectivity in order for our cities more intelligent. Instead we simply need to consume our surroundings differently, look at them differently, understand them to be different and know that if a network is only serving one group of people it is a missed opportunity, a potential calamity, a missed cost saving exercise.
Thinking differently isn't just small. It's huge. My only question is, who is going to step up and take the lead?
Can't have intelligent cities until we have ubiquitous connectivity. Gets us back to the same old story. We have patches of smartness. With connectivity, with people. They all need joining up. Until connectivity is easy and boring it won't happen. I think it was Brian Condon once said that, in 2004 at a colloquium. (the forerunner to unconferences). Bring on the fibre, that's the secret. Join up all the people. Lets have a digitalbritian with a network of people.
Can't answer your question hun, most politicians just get instructions on dead trees and haven't time to look at stuff in real life.

Residents in North Dakota will vote on the legalization of recreational cannabis in this year’s public ballot. Secretary of the state has confirmed that marijuana activists have succeeded in collecting the required number of signatures to make the question of legalization a part of November ballot.
Dave Owen, a cannabis activist who spearheaded the canvassing campaign for the legalization initiative, has termed it a public referendum on recreational cannabis. Last month, Owen’s group Legalize ND was able to gather 17,965 signatures in support of the measure. According to local laws, 14, 637 signatures are required for any question to qualify for the ballot. After verifying the collected signature, the state administration has green-lighted the initiative for the November Ballot.
If voters approve the initiative, it will legalize personal cultivation and possession of marijuana in the state. The measure will also allow the production and sales of cannabis on a commercial basis. Unlike most statewide cannabis laws in the country, the measure doesn’t set any limit on the amount of cannabis a person can possess or the number of plants that can be cultivated domestically.
National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), an organization working nationwide on marijuana law reforms, has congratulated the local cannabis activists who tirelessly worked for the legalization initiative. NORML’s executive director Erik Altieri has particularly appreciated the work of all those volunteers who went door-to-door for canvassing and gathering the required number of signatures.
Altieri believes that the issue of cannabis reforms is not partisan or regional anymore. It is indeed a fact that more than 60 percent of all US citizens want to end cannabis prohibition. One after another, the states are choosing the sagacious path of regulation and legalization instead of persisting with prohibitions and incarcerations.
While voters are gearing to give their opinion on the status of adult-use cannabis, North Dakota Attorney General has already opposed the measure. Even before the activists started to gather the signatures, he had told the media that marijuana legalization wouldn’t be good for the state.
The Attorney General is of the belief that legalization will put the burden on the healthcare sector with increased cases of substance abuse linked to marijuana. In order words, the law enforcement challenges will be shifted from one place to another.
Recreational marijuana might get legalized this November. However, patients in North Dakota are still waiting to get legal access to medical cannabis. Voters passed the Compassionate Care Act for MMJ legalization two years ago through the same public ballot. However, state lawmakers are still trying to work out the provisions of the MMJ program.
Activists are hopeful that the success of the adult-use initiative will speed the development on medical cannabis. The state has received 20 license applications for MMJ dispensaries so far. But it’s not clear when the state will issue licenses to the eligible applicants. It is expected that the sales of medical cannabis will begin next year.

Blue is just everywhere at present in interiors: blue design pieces, blue interiors, blue paint, blue textiles. Probably you noticed this already…if not, maybe after this post you will start seeing blue everywhere as well!
I love what I see around in the shades of blue and since there are really plenty of beautiful inspirations I decided to put together a selection for you today on the blog. Plus some advices. Indeed…it’ easy to say blue, but which shade of blue? That’s the point. It’s very important to choose the right blue hue, to avoid mistakes: as I already told you here, going for coloured walls at home it’s not as easy as it seems, and it’s always better to ask for an architect or interior decorator advice while choosing the right colour.

Thank you for posting Steve Jobs' commencement speech. I've had the benefit of his genius for over 30 years. We bought our first Apple computer in January 1980 and I've had one (or more) ever since.
A life lesson... please he was just a guy... the motivation that we need in life is inside of us, usually people is motivated by their kids, but well.
That is very good comment you shared.Thank you so much that for you shared those things with us.Im wishing you to carry on with ur achivments.All the best.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) has long been known as a state that tends to show up most in young adults usually after age 20 but before age 40. Unfortunately more children than ever before been diagnosed with this condition many before 12 years. The good news is that diagnosing the disease earlier means that treatment can be offered before but there are many annoying symptoms that can occur with multiple sclerosis in children. they often include vision problems coordination problems and cognitive disorders.
Another sign of multiple sclerosis in children can be sudden problems with coordination which does not seem to have an explanation. clumsiness the weakness dizziness and difficulty in balancing all be symptoms of MS fatigue muscle spasms and leg and arm numbness are also symptoms that may contribute to problems with coordination. Of course some children may notice these signs right after a hard workout running for miles or for days with little sleep. Therefore it is important to note that there may be another reason for these signs as well as multiple sclerosis in children before going to a doctor to get the problem checked out.
Many children with MS eventually find it hard to concentrate at school and may also have trouble remembering things. While parents may not notice this kind of cognitive disorders immediately it may become clear when grades suddenly drop for no apparent reason. Of course sudden fatigue and vision do not usually help to improve their grades so a drop in school performance is often one of the first signs that parents pay attention to their children. voice can also be heard stilted with a somewhat monotonous voice and sporadic outbreaks of volume when speaking. such changes may be evident to teachers friends and colleagues over time if they are not immediately noticeable to parents which means that the constant contact with your child can help in getting a case of multiple sclerosis in children diagnosed. c0tBTXVli5

Doyle Dykes is unequivocally one of today�s brightest-shining stars within the arena of fingerstyle guitar. In an era where indulgent, new age droning has become pass�, Dykes has breathed new life into the form of contemporary acoustic guitar, amalgamating flamenco fire, sparkling balladic harmonics, virtuosic tremolo, molten-hot single-note passages, and southern alternating bass techniques into a form of all-too-rare steel-string ascendancy.
But he is not just another in-your-face technician; his compositions teem with aggressive originality, and his takes on standard hymns are enough to convert even the most jaded listener. In a nutshell, Dykes draws deeply from his well of spiritual and musical influences, and pours out fresh water�music that both transfixes our ears and captivates our hearts. But Dykes� ride to relative stardom has not been overnight.
Growing up in Jacksonville, Florida, Dykes was surrounded by a musical family. Receiving his first guitar in his early teens, he immediately went to work, extricating licks from his favorite records, including a lot of Chet Atkins and Merle Travis. Though he flirted with the singer/songwriter mode of expression, Dykes felt the strongest resonance when playing unaccompanied guitar.
In his mid-teens, he added the banjo to his repertoire, and peppered his formidable guitar playing with banjo speak, engrafting frailing and rapid-fire chromatic single-note techniques. Traveling with his family, Dykes attracted increasing attention. He ultimately joined and toured with a gospel group called The Crusaders, then took a job touring with The Stamps, Elvis Presley's former backup band. Disenchanted with some of the backstage antics, he returned home to Jacksonville, Florida, got a day job, and married Rita, his high school sweetheart.
Though Dykes settled into a nine-to-five routine, Providence was lurking around the corner. Setting off a chain reaction of ripe opportunities, �Hee Haw� senior statesman Grandpa Jones performed at a festival near Dykes� hometown. Invited to audition, Dykes lost no time in trying out for Grandpa�s band and was subsequently hired. This was Dykes� link to the Grand Ole Opry, where he later shared the stage with many of his long-time heroes, including Chet Atkins, Merle Travis, and Tennessee Ernie Ford.
Feeling restless, Dykes felt his church-roots beckoning. With the blessing of Grandpa Jones, he left to begin his own ministry as a pastor in Jacksonville, simultaneously playing occasional tour dates. He soon realized that his instrumental music was reaching people, so he dedicated himself to ministering solely through his six-string companion, playing stunning solo renditions of such hymns as Amazing Grace and The Lord�s Prayer.
However, Dykes soon became frustrated again, as he found preaching to the choir too confining. He sought to minister, yet desired a larger audience. One night, while pouring his heart out in prayer Dykes told God that he wanted to be a musician, not a preacher/evangelist. "I felt a presence in the room," Dykes recounts, "and a very warm feeling came over me that let me know this was going to happen."
�Happen� is indeed a good word to describe what has been going on in Dykes� life since that momentous day. Offers have been pouring in, not the least of which have been a record deal with Windham Hill and an endorsement with Taylor Guitars. Through his experience, Dykes has learned the value of being specific in prayer, realizing that for God to take our prayers seriously, we need to take them seriously.

Save The River/Upper St. Lawrence Riverkeeper is monitoring popular summer swimming locations on the River from July 3rd through August 28th on a weekly basis. Due to this season’s high water not all beaches usually sampled each year can be sampled now. However, all beaches sampled on July 3, 2017 passed.
Save The River’s annual sampling program provides a glimpse of the water quality at popular swimming areas during the peak recreational swimming season. For the 2017 sampling season Save The River volunteers will collect water quality samples at five swimming areas along the River: Wilson’s Beach in Cape Vincent, Potter’s Beach on Grindstone Island, Round Island in Clayton, Lake of the Isles on Wellesley Island, and Scenic View Park in Alexandria Bay. Frink Park in Clayton is closed to swimming at this time.
Results are expressed in numbers of bacteria colonies found in 100 milliliter (mL) sample of swimming water. The NY State Department of Health has set a swimming quality limit of 235 colonies of E. coli bacteria per 100 mL of water.
As in previous years, samples collected by Save The River will be tested for E. Coli bacteria. Results will be compared to levels set out in state and federal regulations. Save The River will make the results available to the public each week with a pass/fail system at the organization’s office, online on its webpage (www.savetheriver.org) and by following Save The River on Facebook and Twitter. Results will also be posted on www.swimguide.org and in the T.I. Sun.
Following SD’s recent Annual Show, I gave an interview to 亞洲週刊 (Asia Weekly), a Chinese language international affairs newsweekly. I want to share its original English version here.
Yesterday was the annual World Graphics Day, the day when ICOGRADA celebrates its birthday and an occasion for designers to reflect and “contribute to greater understanding between people and help build bridges where divides and inequities exist.”*
And this year, they are asking designers all around the world, “Why do we value design?” Well, for me, it’s more like “Do you value design?” If you do, then you can ask why. These answers require a bit of thinking indeed. It’s easy to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ but ‘why?’ That is the gut of the question.
I do value design because it adds depth into our lives. When done properly and with respect, it is a functional art piece. Many aspire to become designers without fully understanding the dedication, passion and hard work put into a well-typeset poster or an ergonomic task chair or a naturally ventilated space. Design is powerful! It adds value to my life and in return, i value design.
Time passes very fast!!! It was already two years, and I successfully completed my Master of Engineering in Aerospace Engineering. In here, I feel grateful to have my wife where she has been so consideration and supportive along these years.
During these two years in South Korea, I have learnt and experienced the things that have enhanced my personal skills to be better man. In addition, with this qualification, it allows me to further my PhD. Although it will take me another 3 to 4 years to complete it, but I still feel it is worth for all these.

Maya, a five-year-old Border Collie (pictured), presented symptoms of lethargy and occasional vomiting and diarrhea. She was a dog who loved doing agility trials, but who had become much slower in her performance. Her blood profile was normal, but a very astute doctor kept investigating, and when "Maya" flatlined her ACTH stim test, a diagnosis of Addison's was made.
Addison's disease is an endocrine disorder where the adrenal glands, near the kidneys, fail to produce enough hormones. This disease is relatively uncommon (approximately one case per 3000 dogs) but it is more common in dogs than humans. It is very rare in cats.
The common symptoms of Addison's are lethargy, occasional vomiting or diarrhea, weakness, low body temperature, low heart rate, and shaking. The symptoms are often vague, may be intermittent, and can be attributed to many other causes. The problem is probably under-diagnosed; the doctor must have a high degree of clinical suspicion. The disease can be fatal if left untreated.
Addison's usually affects young to middle-aged dogs, but can occur in any age. About seventy percent of cases are female. Some breeds are more likely to be affected: Great Danes, Newfoundlands, Portuguese Waterdogs, Rottweilers, German Shepherds, Westies, Wheaten Terriers, Springer Spaniels, but the breeds with the highest rates are Standard Poodles, Leonbergers, and Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers.
A regular blood profile may have changes that suggest Addison's, especially certain alterations in the electrolytes. The specific test for the disease is an ACTH stimulation blood test. This test involves two blood draws, one before, and one an hour after an injection of a drug named Cortrosyn. Both of these samples are sent to the reference lab, and the results are compared to one another. A normal animal will respond to the Cortrosyn by a big increase compared to the first sample. An Addisonian animal will not have an increase.
Treatment is either with an oral daily drug, Florinef, or an injectable drug, Percorten, that is given every 25 days. Most veterinarians use Percorten now as it provides better, smoother control of the disease, and does not rely on owner memory and compliance every day. A version of the disease called atypical Addison's may need only oral prednisone. Talk to your veterinarian if you have any concerns about your pet's health.

By Mark Teale Thursday, February 1, 2018 0 Age Pension, Retirement Age pension, aged care, Dream, Housing, income	Permalink 1
In November 2017, legislation was passed that will allow certain individuals who sell their main residence to contribute up to $300,000 of the sale proceeds to superannuation without being constrained by the usual restrictions that otherwise apply to contributions including contribution caps and work requirements.
The value of homes in most capital cities in Australia has increased over four-fold in the last 20 years meaning a large number of people over the age of 80 who are in receipt of an age pension are living in the largest asset that they own.
Aside from the comfort provided by the home and the feeling of security one has when you do own your home, this very valuable asset does not provide any income to meet the everyday living costs of a couple.
It is important to remember that this asset is also exempt from the asset’s test when it comes to assessing a person’s pension entitlement
During this same period, wages and the age pension have certainly not increased by anywhere near that amount. In fact, the increase is closer to only two-fold.
So, for the average full rate age pension couple – what is the incentive to take advantage of this very ‘generous’ change in legislation enabling a person who is not working and over the age of 65 to contribute superannuation after downsizing their home?
Every person’s circumstances are different, but I would like to use as an example of a couple living in Sydney who have been in their family home for 50 years. They are now in their 80’s receiving the full age pension, have close to $100,000 in bank accounts and term deposits, with a car and personal assets valued at $20,000.
What is the overriding incentive for this couple to sell their home for $1.2 million and downsize to a smaller unit costing $600,000 then deposit the balance of the sale proceeds into superannuation?
No doubt their age pension will take a substantial hit, reducing from full age pension of $35,058 per annum to $8,577 per annum paid under the assets test. No doubt that the extra $600,000 they now have in cash will be more than capable of offsetting this loss of age pension income.
However, to provide this new source of income, does the money need to be contributed to superannuation?
What is their tax position if the money is contributed to superannuation, and an account based pension is commenced drawing the minimum for a person who is 80 – 7% or $21,000 per annum each.
Their total yearly income now equals $50,577 – account based pension drawdown of $42,000 combined, plus a combined age pension of $8,577.
Tax payable would be nil, the income from the account based pension as we know is tax-free and certainly, the individual age pension is well below the tax threshold.
It looks attractive, but if they just deposit the money into Term Deposits with the bank and arrange with the bank to draw a similar income stream form these Term Deposits – what would their tax position be?
As they are over the age of 65, they are both entitled to the Seniors and Pensioners Tax Offset of $1,602 each, meaning they don’t pay tax in this situation either.
So, in this couple’s position, and I would say a large number of age and service pensioners, tax is not going to be influencing factor in contributing the balance of any home sale proceeds into superannuation.
The other very important consideration for an elderly couple when they are asking the question should I downsize is their health.
One in three people over the age of 80 will need to enter residential aged care, what is their position as a couple if one person does have to enter care?
If we use the same set of circumstances – a home worth $1.2 million, $100,000 in cash plus motor vehicle and personal assets of $20,000 – and one member of the couple enters age care.
He or she would be classified as low means and would not have to pay a Refundable Accommodation Deposit. They would, however, pay a small Daily Accommodation Payment of $6.00 per day on top of their Basic Daily Care Fee of $49.42 per day, a total of $20,232 per annum. As they are now classified as an illness separated couple their pension increases to the full single rate of $894.40 per fortnight or $23,254 per annum each.
However, what if the couple have taken advantage of the new legislation – sold their home, purchased a smaller residence and deposited the excess of $600,000 into superannuation and commenced two account-based pensions?
For the person now entering aged care, the ongoing costs in the home would be similar – the basic daily care fee of $49.42 per day plus a means-tested care fee of $7.00 per day.
The big difference would be that the person entering the home would not be classified as low means, and they would be required to pay the aged care facilities advertised Refundable Accommodation Deposit. The average deposit in Sydney is close to $450,000 but do remember this can be as high as $550,000 or more.
As a result of the person moving into aged care and the RAD being paid their pensions have now increased to the $22,080 per annum, not quite the full rate. Reason for this is that the total of the account based pensions is now only $150,000, not $600,000
I should mention that I am a firm believer in people using their assets in retirement, whether it be superannuation or their home, but I do think that when we are faced with an elderly couple looking to downsize and deposit the excess of the sale funds into superannuation we do need to take into consideration all the issues and whether there is a genuine need for the money to be placed into superannuation.
PK believes people have the right to accurate, affordable and unbiased information that addresses all aspects of their preferred retirement lifestyle, thereby giving them the opportunity to make informed decisions that will empower them to live out their lives with dignity, certainty and security.
Tealey’s ambition is to change how people think about their retirement, he wants people to dream, plan and realise retirement is not defined by a magical age prescribed by the legislation.

On one side, there are those blues which are desaturated with a hint of gray, I feel they are like a darker and less sugary version of Serenity Pantone 2016. On the other side, very dark blues, in line with that moody trend I mentioned here among the hottest autumn winter 2016/2017 trends. And probably will going to last!
Da un lato i blu più attuali sono quelli desaturati con una punta di grigio, in pratica una versione più scura e meno mielosa del Serenity che con il Rosa Quarzo è il Pantone 2016. Dall’altro sono i blu molto scuri, in linea con il trend moody di cui vi parlavo qui tra le tendenze più forti del momento, e probabilmente dei prossimi, che vede un po’ tutti gli interni scurirsi.
Ali ABUNIMAH: "France now more repressive of boycott calls than Israel" (The Electronic Intifada, November 4, 2015): click here!
On 20 October, France’s highest court of criminal appeals upheld the conviction of a dozen Palestine solidarity activists for publicly calling for the boycott of Israeli goods. The ruling by the Court of Cassation adds to growing concerns about the harsh crackdown on free speech, backed by French President François Hollande, since the murders of journalists at the offices of the magazine Charlie Hebdo in January. It also makes France, in addition to Israel, the only country to penalize appeals not to buy Israeli goods.

The first two songs selected from the pewter soup tureen that had its own stool on stage were "Cooksferry Queen" and "Why Must I Plead," and my immediate thought was, "Damn! Why didn't I think of Why Must I Plead?" Silly, I got to hear it anyway, as this very special all request, solo acoustic show began in perfect style.
A Richard Thompson show always leaves me feeling the same way, stunned by the beauty of his guitar playing, so much so that I drift off and tend to lose sight of what he is singing. No one can play an acoustic guitar quite like RT.
The requests kept coming, two or three being removed at a time, for "pacing purposes." "We wouldn't want 15 wrist-slashers in a row," Thompson explained. "Turning Of The Tide," "Persuasion," "She Sang Angels To Rest," and an aborted, but still quite good version of "Both Sides Now," all being performed from the heart, even if Thompson gave the hairy eyeball to just about every song he pulled.
Someone requested "She May Call You Up" by The Left Banke, which Thompson performs live often. He offered up some info that will forever haunt me. "I could play the whole Left Banke first album." WHEN?
Someone else requested "Peace, Love, & Understanding," to which Thompson replied, "You should try that at an Elvis Costello show. You may have better luck."
I didn't get to hear my request, "The Way That It Shows," but I did have to leave a bit earlier than expected. Nothing personal, Richard. Well actually, yes it was.
Richard Thompson has two more nights of this at City Winery and if I was a rich man, I'd be at both. Get there if you can!
What was more exciting ?....seeing " Burning Wood " in person there or seeing the great " Richard Thompson " perform live ?
I don't buy this " by request " format....Let this " one of a kind " genius build his own set...instead of letting dopey fans dictate the performance, excluding Sal & I..........of course...
I love love love seeing him. I think that Meanstreets has a point though. The request set, by it's nature, does not have a structure. It seems willy nilly. That said, the songs on Wednesday night were pretty great. so I was generally happy. I saw him last fall in Great Barrington and I felt his rapport with the crowd wad better as the banter was not just about the song selection. The guy is seriously funny and smart and I felt his banter was too song related.

I made my first trip to Africa — South Africa, to be precise — the first week of April and it was nothing short of amazing. I’ve broken this Travel Log down by city, as the places we visited — Johannesburg and Cape Town — were pretty distinct. Be sure to click through the slideshow to see some of the images I took on my vacation.
First off, the 20-plus hours of flight time from Los Angeles was crucial. I went with a group of about 25 people from my church, and we arrived late on Thursday so our fun didn’t really begin until Friday. After enjoying breakfast at the hotel, our group took a brief walk to Nelson Mandela Square and the attached mall. The South Africans could definitely tell we weren’t from there, as seen in the looks of confusion/judgment on their faces. However, I remained impressed by their impeccable style. I loved all the head wraps the women donned with pride. So many patterns and intricate ways of styling them. I was taken aback by the sheer magnitude of the Nelson Mandela statue in the square. This is a country that really loves, respects and appreciates its late former president. That Mandela has made such a profound impact on the world was evidenced by how Africans and Americans and other foreigners alike lined up for photos with the ginormous figure. Later that night, we attended a service at Rhema Blessings House Church, where my pastor, Wayne Chaney Jr., was speaking at the church’s five-year anniversary celebration. It was such an awe-inspiring feeling to see South Africans worshipping Christ in their native dialect. I think it was Zulu. Suddenly the world felt small. Also, it was lit! The worship team had the most energy I’ve every seen of any choir and by far the best dance moves.

This is another Cyrsti's Condo archive post from my birthday in 2011, which turned out to be quite the day and gives all of you a glimpse into my life a couple years ago. As I look back I thought, "Has it only been two years ago?"
Today had to be my best birthday ever! My third visit to the VA therapist seeking a hormone permission letter was late in the afternoon. As I got ready to meet my daughter for a birthday breakfast, I received a text from a long time female friend who I have progressively come out to over the past couple months. She wished me a good birthday and a positive trip to the "Doc" which meant a lot!
My breakfast with my daughter was very different. Almost immediately she asked me if I knew one of the performers in one of the top drag queen acts in the area. They are known as the "Rubi Girls" based out of Dayton, Ohio. As it turns out I had seen their act (impressive) and actually knew one of the performer's employees. As surprising as this was, more surprising was the fact I was having the conversation with her at all. The rest of the breakfast was equally as good and I'm still not sure how I did so well in the daughter department.
On to the therapist appointment. We exchanged the usual "how's life" questions before I asked the magic question: "what reservations did she have about writing a permission letter?" She didn't hestitate and said she expected the question and pulled a file folder off her desk The folder contained the "Harry Benjamin Gender Dysphoria Care Standards". As we went through the highlights it seemed I met most all of the criteria. (I'm not exactly sure anyone but Harry understood them all.) She was very positive and said she would like to take one more step before writing the letter. The step was a final consultation about me with a very experienced gender specialist in Columbus. Ironically she is the same person I went to for help over 20 years ago. I know "nothing is over until it's over" but I'm cautiously optimistic I will have the letter in two weeks at my next visit.
My last (but far from least) stop of the day was a lite dinner date with a GF down in Cincinnati. Without getting too personal, it was a wonderful ending to a special day. On the trip home I was going pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming but I have a real aversion to pain and just made sure I wasn't driving up I-75 in a dream. I can guarantee you I-75 between Dayton and Cincinnati, Ohio is no place to be dreaming behind the wheel and I wasn't. The day was all so real and so wonderful!"

Summary: A recent report from the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorney calls for a change in the law regarding student loan debt. Citing student loan debt as an impending crisis to the economy, other experts agree the 1998 law prohibiting filing bankruptcy for student loans must be changed.
Forget home foreclosures and deep credit card debt, student loans are racing to the top of the list of causes for filing bankruptcy. The advice that it pays to have an education needs an update. It should say paybacks for an education could ruin your life.
A report issued recently by the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys cites student loan debt in the United States at $1 trillion while the nation’s credit card debt is supposedly about $798 billion. The two types of debt aren’t really comparable.
Those burdened with heavy credit card debt can file for relief through bankruptcy. Many file Chapter 7 and debts are erased. They have the opportunity financially to start over.
On the other hand, those burdened with excessive student loan payments do not have that option. By law, student loans cannot be discharged. Filing Chapter 13 can make a slight difference. During the payment plan period, borrowers are safe from collection activity. In addition, a judge decides on payment amounts. It’s possible for the payment or interest rate to be temporarily lowered.
Before a law passed in 1998 mandating no bankruptcy discharges for student loans, those loans were treated like any other debt. Students could eventually get financial relief by filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Courts could legally discharge student loans after 7 years of repayment.
Then legislators opted for the more extreme law currently in place. The only way student loans can be wiped out through bankruptcy these days is to claim and prove undue hardship.
Since 1998, the majority of borrowers claiming undue hardship status have been rejected. With a few exceptions, it is extremely difficult to gain undue hardship status for the purpose of wiping out student loan debt. When undue hardship is denied, borrowers are left with the choice of making payments or defaulting on the loan.
Complicated bankruptcy laws regarding student loans can be confusing for many consumers. For example, limited loan forgiveness plans do exist. Students working in some service careers such as teachers or firefighters, can have part of their student loans forgiven if they meet all the criteria. Unfortunately, students in the designated professions often end up not eligible for these programs due to minute details in the rules. Finally, the student loan trap is grabbing the attention of many politicians. Suggestions from constituents and bankruptcy attorneys are under careful consideration. The report issued by the bankruptcy attorney’s group, contends bankruptcy laws must change due to the drastic numbers of borrowers faced with little hope of ever getting out of debt.
President Obama recently addressed the student loan fiasco by proposing regulations to cap loan payments according to income. His plan would wipe out student loan balances after 20 years of payments. Those proposals could help future borrowers but they won’t help students already sinking from high payments for Federal or private loans secured prior to 2012.
Borrowers currently repaying sizable student loans should consult with a reputable St. Louis bankruptcy attorney. Bankruptcy questions regarding undue hardship or other concerns are best answered by those in the know.
With the hope of possible changes to stringent bankruptcy laws regarding student loan debt happening soon, current borrowers sinking in student loan debt can consider filing a Chapter 13 petition. The court can establishment a repayment plan and grant some protection from creditors during the repayment process.
Until Congress takes on the student loan dilemma and changes bankruptcy laws granting students the same relief as other debtors, options for those weighed down in debt are extremely limited. Consult with a St. Louis bankruptcy attorney for updates in the law and other bankruptcy questions.

There are some corporate advisors that charge as much as $100,000 or even $250,000 to simply have them available for advice on the growth of the business. And for the right type of advice this could easily be worth it. If it was to help you build yourself to the million dollar or multi-million dollar level it could easily be worth an investment of 100k or 250k because the benefit you get isn't just the increase over one year, it's the benefit of the increase over every year in the future. This one investment in yourself could be worth MILLIONS. Think about it.
Phil Anderson was managing a health club, and couldn’t get out of the day to day operations to really do what he wanted to do, he said “Chris, I feel stuck.”
He went through one of my business building programs, and as a result learned a simple strategy that allowed him to make $600k in a Single day and increase his net-worth by $2million in just a year. Then was able to retire at Age 38. He uses his time now teaching others how to retire rich and young as well.
I have profited as much as $600,000 in a single day and have seen a net result of more than $2 million.
As a direct result of Chris’s unique approach, I have restructured my entire business and lifestyle. I now no longer feel overwhelmed. Every skill learned and applied compounds the results I see.

"Solidarity with the Palestinian popular resistance! Boycott Israel now!"(Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC), October 10, 2015): click here!
"Whether the current phase of Israel’s intensified repression and Palestinian popular resistance will evolve into a full-fledged intifada or not, one thing is already evident—a new generation of Palestinians is marching on the footsteps of previous generations, rising up en masse against Israel’s brutal, decades-old regime of occupation, settler colonialism and apartheid".
"After 1,100 anthropologists signed petition calling for boycott last year, AAA task force presents several options for action".
"Palestinian Student Groups in Gaza Respond to Attacks on BDS by “NYC SJP”"(BDS Movement, 8 October 2015): click here!
"The Palestinian Students’ Campaign for the Academic Boycott of Israel (PSCABI) and all the undersigned student groups, representing the entire political spectrum in Gaza, are deeply troubled by a recent article titled, “The BDS Ceiling,” written by the newly formed group New York City Students for Justice in Palestine (NYC SJP). The most disconcerting aspect of this article is that, despite its veneer of leftist rhetoric, it does a great disservice to those it purports to represent and be in solidarity with".
"...The term “Palestinian Civil Society” is invoked with such reverence and awe that one would be led to believe that “Civil Society” is in fact a monolith with consolidated theoretical understanding of the settler-colonial reality in Palestine, with a coherent strategy to not just petition internationals to boycott and divest, but to build power in Palestine to lead a revolutionary struggle against Zionism".
"Suleiman is on the national steering committee of Students for Justice in Palestine, which represents more than 100 local chapters across the US — a number that increases every year. “The recent news about escalation about campus repression, and Sheldon Adelson injecting all this money to fight us, is actually good news,” Suleiman said."
"The Israel lobby is redirecting resources to a new project after its failure to stop the Iran nuclear deal despite spending an estimated $30 million to halt it. Following the defeat, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered a campaign against the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) movement that is spreading on American college campuses. The funding is flowing from donors closely linked to Netanyahu’s government. But the effort has almost instantly run into trouble. It is inspiring an atmosphere of incitement and intimidation, and the FBI is now investigating violent threats made against BDS activists."
"Lawyers have responded to nearly 300 incidents of “censorship, punishment, or other burdening of advocacy for Palestinian rights” filed by Palestine solidarity activists on more than 65 US campuses in the last year and a half. Palestine Legal and the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) detail the assault in a new 124-page report, “The Palestine Exception to Free Speech: A Movement Under Attack in the US.”"

Comprised of two distinct sections, this book will first help those looking for work to find a great job. The second section then helps those who have a job keep it and thrive while moving forward in a rewarding career. Janice Bryant Howroyd brings her career and work/life balance expertise together to teach you how to manage the everyday job and career challenges all of us face.
She outlines the core principles that have allowed her to rise to the top of her field, leading a global workforce solutions company that has grown into a global success story. Through “The Art of Work: How to Make Work, Work for You!” JBH serves as your mentor and helps you to create your own path to job and career success!
This timeless message about motivation, mindfulness, and character development will impact the world as the gift that keeps on giving.” “Our hope is that with Janice’s new version of The Strangest Secret, a new audience will discover Earl Nightingale’s original ground-breaking recordings and apply them to their own lives,” said Vic Conant, Chairman Nightingale-Conant.
This new version includes updated statistics and additional quotes from some of the greatest thought leaders, including Nelson Mandela and Buddha. It is written as gender-neutral, and for the first time it contains a women’s point of view. Many of these older books focus on saying things such as: “when a man” instead of “when a person”. Howroyd believes that words matter and can make a difference.
A seminal piece on the power of thought, developed in collaboration with Nightingale-Conant, Janice Bryant Howroyd voices this original classic written by James Allen, a pioneer of the self-help movement. Originally published in 1903, As a Man Thinketh is an essay which argues that the key to mastering your life is harnessing the power of your thoughts and helps you cultivate the philosophy and attitude of a positive, successful person.
As a Person Thinks, now enhanced for the 21st century and written as gender-neutral, contains a women’s point of view for the first time. Many of these older books focus on saying things such as “when a man” instead of “when a person”. Howroyd believes that words matter and can make a difference.

All iPhone and iPad users will know that a big part of using Apple devices is iTunes. This companion software is installed on a computer and used to manage and backup the device. Being shackled to this software can be very frustrating, turning many people over to Android, but there are alternatives out there.
iTools for Windows is one such alternative which gives you access to a raft of features that will help you to manage and tweak your phone without relying on iTunes, plus it’s free to download.
To put it simply, iTools for Windows lets you manage your Apple devices in Windows. Most of what this software offers is already available on iTunes, but a lot of people find iTunes tricky to use and look for alternatives. This app is great for those people, offering a free way to tweak your device with a simpler and Apple-free user interface. The primary features of iTools are being able to manage apps (a lot quicker than trying to drag them all around on the phone screen), importing photos and viewing device storage levels. However, you can go further than that.
For example, the Ringtone maker is an excellent addition which is sadly lacking from iTunes. This lets you turn your songs into ringtones, something Android phones do for free and Apple is strangely lacking. You can also access iTunes backup data, so you won’t have to keep switching programs.
The great thing about iTools for Windows is that while the core features are the same as those offered by iTunes, they have gone some lengths towards improving on Apple’s design.
For example, when managing apps, you can see three buttons next to each app which let you check out the app info, back it up or uninstall at a single click. These little usability touches make this software more user-friendly and will appeal to those tired of messing with iTunes.
It should be noted however that the app manager can be slow; this software struggles at time to access devices. This free app is very well laid out, similar enough to iTunes to make it easy to learn, but different enough to solve problems you may get with the original. Managing your media is very easy with a drag and drop interface, plus iTools converts mp3 to m4r automatically at the point of transfer to save you more time and effort.
Those wishing to have a little more access to their phone will find iTools for Windows very useful. Despite being free there are no adverts and this software works with both jailbroken and default devices, which may be a consideration for those who have modified phones.
You’ll even find system cleanup tools to help your device run smoothly, one of many features Apple themselves have neglected to provide. For the power user who wants to try going deeper into their device, this free software is certainly worth a try.

Retirees who find it hard to stay in their residential homes in Dunsborough will soon have another option. This comes after Murray Mallee Aged Care, a non-profit organisation, launched construction of Warner Close; who’s retirement villages which will comprise 50 living units located off Warner Road (at the Far West end of the town). This project is set to test a new model for the housing industry.
Generally, plumbers are usually on pretty high demand to fix damages both in commercials and residential water pipes. According to West Best Plumbung director, Sharon Hitchins, this is one year that has had the highest number of fixes due to freezing temperatures over the 20-plus years she has been working in the industry. She added that they receive calls, almost daily, to go fix water pipes.

After heading Christian Super for nine years, Peter Murphy has decided to leave the organisation to join Financial Planners Perth. The World Vision chief operating officer Ross Piper will fill in the vacant seat; the superannuation fund announced on Wednesday. The announcement is the fund’s response to the resignation of its chief executive, who has officially ended his role in April 2017.
A lot of young christian men and women want a glamorous wedding without thinking about the costs involved. However, not everyone can afford this expense as they do not have the right assistance, information or a source that can help in choosing the right things at the right time at the right price. The good news is an inexpensive wedding reception can be achieved with an elegant flair if you plan a few months ahead of the wedding. Though it is not possible to cut cost at huge rates but achieving a savings of at least 30% is quite possible according to Marquee Hire Perth.

Somewhere between prohibiting Mr. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab from flying and allowing him onto an airplane with explosives stashed in his briefs, there’s a gulf. Rather than bridge this chasm by focusing increased attention on the half million suspicious persons who have been identified, new rules will keep hundreds of millions of non-threatening passengers confined to their seats; books, blankets and computers protectively out of their laps in a response that will do little to address the real terror threat.
As we opened Christmas presents the other morning, the kids and I took notes about who gave us what. That list, scribbled in the chaos of Christmas morning, becomes an important document when it’s time to write our thank you notes.
Because they die one by one, the deaths of airport workers are little noticed events. While families grieve, news accounts focus on the question of whether airline operations were disrupted or air travelers inconvenienced.
In the not too distant future, Southwest Airlines, the company that made its reputation by playing industry contrarian may look more like the competition. In an interview, Southwest chief executive Gary Kelly told me the airline has matured to the point, "we have to be more than just a low fare carrier."

As anyone who has driven with a teenager knows, there is no more valuable teacher of driving skills than experience. Which is why I was so disturbed to read the comment of a Colgan Air executive speaking to a Wall Street Journal reporter earlier this month. Colgan, you remember was the regional airline handling Continental’s Flight 3047 into Buffalo, New York on February 12. The plane crashed into a neighborhood killing 49 people on board and one man on the ground. The National Transportation Safety Board has yet to issue a probable cause report on the accident.

How pretty is this flowy white tunic?! I love the off-the-shoulder neckline and we all know I'm a sucker for over-sized anything! The sleeves are gorgeous too! I have been looking for a top like this ever since I saw a photo on Pinterest years ago of a girl wearing one very similar. I finally stumbled upon this one in the sale section of Altar'd State. Score!
Because the top is so big & flowy [& beautiful], I paired it with skinny jeans to balance me out and the Steve Madden booties I adore from my Dear Mr. Madden post.

This outfit is meant to be my New Year's look but I couldn't help but take a few photos in front of this pretty Christmas set up, soooo...there you go.
I told ya'll I was saving my favorite post from the shoot with Stevi and Roger for last, and here it is!
I'm happy to bring another post featuring Stevi and Roger to The Life of a Lady this week. This time, we're going for a more casual look for both women and men.
These last few weeks have been a whirlwind and I can't help but stop to thank God that I'm finally finding what I think I'm meant to do. I've been enjoying taking my blog further and further and broadening my life with an unexpected interest in photography. I can't wait to see where this newfound passion takes me. Check out some of my photography work on my SERVICES page!
I'm super excited to bring something new to the blog, ya'll! I'm broadening my styling horizons to men's fashion and can't thank Roger and Stevi enough for letting me dress them up for three looks!
The first is obviously geared toward the holiday season! There are so many opportunities during this time of year to get creative with party looks. Hopefully these will give you some inspiration for your next holiday event!

Happy Monday, ya'll! I hope you all had a great Thanksgiving filled with food, family, and memories!

I bought this dress because I've been obsessed with anything suede lately. When I brought it home and tried it on, I was less than thrilled about it because I felt it looked a little boring on me. But then, I added accessories and my mind is completely changed. It just goes to show you that a few accessories can change how you feel about a piece drastically. Just thought I'd share that tidbit of information in case you ever feel something is a little too "blah" for your liking. Now, I love this dress. I've worn it twice already(:
Today, I'm showing you a look that's both, fall appropriate and will still keep you cool when temperatures are still high up there.
Day 4 was spent relaxing by the pool and in the hot tub. I could do this all day, every day, for the rest of my life.
Day one consisted of my first plane experience since I was too young to know what a plane even was...I was nervous, but I got over it and now, I feel like I can fly anywhere.
Happy Monday, ya'll! If you're reading this any time between Monday, October 19 and Wednesday, October 21, I'll be soaking up some sun on the deck of the Royal Oasis cruise ship and enjoying every minute of it! (;
Don't worry, I'm taking plenty of photos and will, of course, post a recap of my adventures to the Bahamas!
This week, I'm bringing wideleg vibes to The Life of a Lady and I am LOVING it! You all know that my love for 1970's fashion is never-ending, so these amazing Free People pants are making their second appearance on the blog. Check out my Back from the 70's post to see their debut.
Today's look is brought to you by coffee. Because that's the only thing getting me through this crazy morning.
I'm obsessed with how it all turned out and sad that it's over at the same time, so we're just going to have to find some time to do it again in the future, right ladies?!
All pieces from these three looks I'm showing you today are stocked in the shop now! ....minus the boots, just sayin.
All pieces (except boots) from these three looks are currently stocked at Susan's Boutique in New Iberia, LA! Head to the shop ASAP to get your look together for Sugarcane Festival weekend if you haven't already!
Day 3 of the Fall Lookbook series for Susan's Boutique in New Iberia, LA has arrived and I'm showing you a couple of great looks that you locals will look amazing in for the Sugarcane Festival this weekend!
All pieces from these two looks are currently stocked in the shop with the exception of the boots, so run and get yours now!
All pieces from these two looks are currently stocked in the shop with the exception of the shoes and hats.
Today, I'm kicking off a weeklong series of posts full of fabulous fall fashion from Susan's Boutique in New Iberia, LA!
Susan's is devoted to bringing fabulous styles to ladies in both junior's and women's sizes. The shop carries the perfect ratio of classic and trendy pieces with tons of unique jewelry and accessories! It's currently full of beautiful pieces to help you transition from summer to fall!
All pieces from these two looks are currently stocked in the shop with the exception of the shoes which can be found in Maegan's and Kristen's closets, but those are off limits to you guys! Sorry(;
Happy Monday! Question: Are you a "dress for the weather" person or a "dress for the season" person?
Me? I'm a "dress for the season but will not be caught in a fur vest and boots in 80 degree weather just because it's September" person. You know, the normal kind. So here's to you, Louisiana, for keeping it nice and toasty outside just the way I like it until you're ready to freeze over completely..at which time, I will be happily locked inside my heated apartment with lots of books and coffee to get me through to summer again. Ok, I'm not that cynical..I just really love summer.
The drop waist top can be paired with jeans or leggings (hellooo comfort!). I went with a light washed pair of jeans this time and cuffed them to show off my favorite pair of tan booties. Layered necklaces (as usual) add detail to this solid colored top.
It's Monday again, and although Monday's are no one's favorite day of the week, you better believe I've got something to occupy you for about five minutes. Haha. Last weekend, I went down south for a quick visit with my momma and enjoyed some bayou-side quality time with her.
Happy Monday, readers! Today, I'm bringing you a post that's very near and dear to my heart! I'm featuring a boutique adventure that my college friend, Jamie Rogers, recently embarked on and I could not be more proud of her! J'aime Boutique is located in Bayou Vista, LA, and it is THE place to go for all of your inner flower child's desires! Everything about this adorable little shop screams boho chic!
It's Monday again, ya'll! My weekend went by way too fast, but I did have tons of fun and I'll have the pictures to prove it next week.
This week's post is the final installment of the Sisters of New Iberia Boutique Spotlight, and this time, I'm showing you the look I chose for myself from this fab little shop!
It's no secret that I love a great maxi skirt. What is a secret, however, is that I've always been a little too self conscious to rock the crop top in it's true, midriff baring form. Hey, I didn't say it was a super juicy/interesting secret. I'm working on letting that insecurity go, though (ignore the rhyme), and trying to let loose a little.
Hey party people! Today, I'm teaming up with Warby Parker to show you how I #seesummerbetter in their amazing sunglasses! I may not be doing a whole lot of traveling, but I'm still having a nice summer! Here's how I spend my free time!
At around 7:30PM last night, my college town was struck with devastating tragedy as a gunman opened fire inside a movie theater I spent many nights at. The shooter killed 3 including himself, and injured several more locals in the place I still call home. It is with a heavy heart that I bring this topic to my otherwise cheerful, bubbly blog. As our community comes closer together during this time of confusion and fear, my prayer is that all of these tragic events come to an end soon. That we rely on our Savior to guide us through what is now a very scary world to live in. We cannot live in fear.
A couple weeks ago, I introduced you to a fab little boutique in my hometown called Sisters. Well, I'm back with Part TWO of my Sisters looks and this one stars my own little sister, Lexi, again! How many times can I say "sister(s)" in one post?
It's always difficult to get back to business on Monday morning, but when you've had an extra long weekend, it's even more difficult...or is it just me? Annnyyywayyyy, Happy Monday, ladies and gentlemen! This week's look is a casual one...most of my looks are.
Last weekend, I had the pleasure of popping into a great boutique in my home town and styling my pretty baby sister with a few of the awesome pieces in the store! Sisters is owned and run by Mrs. Angela Courtois who was the sweetest, most helpful lady anyone could ask for! Her shop is full of unique displays and one-of-a-kind props that make her shop different from the rest. And, of course, she's got some really great pieces from amazing brands!
In honor of Father's Day, my fabulous little sister came up to visit my dad and I for the weekend! We're two peas in a pod, so any time we get to spend with each other is always a good time. We went to see my cousin's band, Quiet District, play in a nearby town and had a blast.
I'm not one to get my nails professionally done all that often. I, honestly, can't remember the last time I went to a salon for a mani. I enjoy it and all, but why drive to a salon and pay to get my nails done, when I can stay at home in my pj's and do them myself while binge watching episodes of One Tree Hill on Netflix all day? No reason. No reason at all.
I've said it before, and I'll say it again; the 1970's has been a long time front runner for the title of my favorite fashion era. Today, we're talking about, English babe, Olivia Newton John, particularly, her ensemble in the photo below.
What I love about this look from her is the mix of chunky accessories (i.e. her belt and platform boots) with a casual t-shirt, shorts, vest combo. 70's glamour and 60's minimalism all in the same look.
Start with a basic, olive colored, long sleeved top. This one is updated a tad bit because of the cropped hemline.
A pair of denim shorts is next on the list. Olivia's are super short, but stick with whatever's comfortable for you.
Part of what makes me love this look so much is the long plaid vest. Any print will work here, since the rest of the look is solid, so have fun with it! The two below are great options.
Olivia's boots scream 60s and 70s. A gray boot with a chunky heel will give a similar effect to your look. If it's too hot to wear a knee high boot where you are, go for an ankle boot!
My favorite part of her look is her belt. I think it's such a fun statement piece. Add the same type of statement to your look with a toned down chain belt like this one, or the many others on the market right now!
Complete your look with a long, gold necklace, and you're good to groove! Haha! Sorry for the cheesiness, but you know you love it as much as I do!
There's something so fun about recreating an amazing look from the past! What is your favorite fashion decade to pull inspiration from? Let me know in the comments!
PS- Check out my post for SBmag.net on metallic temporary tattoos! And bookmark the website to see more posts from me there!
The concept that a significantly lighter, smaller, and faster way to inflate flat bike tires could be carried in a jersey pocket or backpack was revolutionary.

"Israeli citizens for boycott call on Reykjavik to stand by its decision"(Mondoweiss, September 22 2015): click here!
"We write to you as citizens of Israel who actively oppose our successive governments’ policies of belligerent occupation, colonialism, ethnic cleansing and apartheid against the indigenous people of this land, the Palestinians. We write to you today to encourage you to stand by your initial and worthy decision to hold the State of Israel accountable for its consistent human rights violations, and to boycott Israeli goods."
An explanatory memorandum notes that the boycott is meant to show that the City of Reykjavík supports the right of Palestinians to independence, while condemning “the Israeli policy of apartheid” in the occupied Palestinian territories.

"Israeli military companies, all of which are deeply involved in Israel’s war crimes against the Palestinian people, among others, see the Olympic Games as an opportunity for profit and a means to export their “field-tested” expertise in maintaining apartheid, repression of people, and militarization of urban spaces across the globe. They must be stopped...".

The letter can be co-signed by artists and cultural workers via email: letterforpalestine@gmail.com.
"...The cultural and academic boycott of Israel is the other central aspect of the BDS rallying cry. They are particularly important for effacing the myth — so ardently presented by fundamentalist and liberal Zionists alike — that the sphere of civil society is apolitical and in no way complicit in its state’s policies... BDS’s cultural and academic boycott insists that such structural racism should be held accountable at the level of civil society and seeks to expose the oft-heard lie that but for the activities of the state, Israeli society would be a thriving, tolerant democracy."
Eman ELSHAIKH: "We Must Boycott Israeli Universities in Order to Defend Academic Freedom" (Muftah.org., August 5, 2015).
"The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) was a founding member of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement and remains an important part of it today.

Ståle HOLGERSEN: "I was going to a conference... (yet more reasons for an academic boycott of Israel)" (academia.edu, 28 July 2015).
"... Since the state of Israel continues to ignore international rights and UN resolutions; since it continues relentlessly to attack academic freedom in Palestine in all kinds of ways; since the Israeli universities are so interwoven with the actual occupation, there are no other alternatives than an international academic boycott of Israeli institutions – including academic ones. Just kilometres and miles from where Palestinians are deprived their right to education, the Israeli universities produce the knowledge on how to strengthen the occupation. For the sake of humanity please join the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel."

"The Palestinians are poor. They are powerless. They have no voice or influence in the halls of power. They are demonized. They do not have well-heeled lobbyists doling out campaign contributions and pushing through pro-Palestinian legislation. No presidential candidate is appealing to donors—as Hillary Clinton did when she sent a letter to media mogul Haim Saban denouncing critics of Israel—by promising to advance the interests of the Palestinian people. Palestinians, like poor people of color in the United States, are expendable... The fight for the Palestinians is our fight. If the Palestinians are not liberated none of us will be liberated. We cannot pick and choose which of the oppressed are convenient or inconvenient to defend. We will stand with all of the oppressed or none of the oppressed. And when we stand with the oppressed we will be treated like the oppressed."
"...In a public letter, published in Brazil’s O Globo newspaper, Caetano Veloso wrote: “My heart is strongly against the arrogant right position of the Israeli government. I hate the occupation policy, the inhuman decisions that Israel took in what [Benjamin] Netanyahu tells us is self-defense. And I think most Israelis who are interested in our music tend to react in a similar way to the politics of his country.” Veloso also claimed that he hoped that Israelis opposed to the occupation would take heart from their performance — ignoring the existence of Israeli activists who also call for international rejection of their country’s crimes."
"Fifteen trade unions in Gaza have jointly renewed their support for the boycott of Israel and its labor institutions that are complicit in the violation of Palestinian rights...

Roy ISACOWITZ: "Target me with your boycott, please." (Medium, 2 July 2015, source: Haaretz, 2 July).
"Sometimes there’s no choice but a boycott, even if that means collective punishment for all — including the people you’re seeking to help... After almost 50 years of Israeli defiance and evasion, there is little prospect of diplomatic change. The prime goal of the boycott against Israel, therefore, is to persuade the bulk of Israelis that the occupation is not in their interests. And the way to do that is by focusing their attention sharply on what those interests are and how much they have to lose. It follows that boycotting only the settlements and their commerce, as many on the Israeli left suggest, makes no sense...".
"Professor Judith Butler, one of the most prominent spokespeople of BDS, has written of non-violent protest focused on opposition to illegal forms of dispossession, enforcement and denial of human rights. BDS provides the means for non-state actors to act against the Occupation, dispossession, illegal settlement and the terrorism carried out by Israel against the Palestinians. Its purpose is to put an end to a form of civil separation based on racist principles, and to fight for the Palestinians’ right to self-determination. Anti-Semitism?

"In the occupied West Bank, almost anything can come to be seen as a threat to Israel’s security. Even cows. Yes, cows. Here’s the story: During the activism of the first Palestinian intifada, residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour organized boycotts of Israeli goods in an act of civil disobedience intended to pressure the government.

I have had the most beautiful experience with this woman. first of all it is very communicative and makes a GFE REAL, smells very nice and is very clean and lives is a clean place! I felt very good doing great sex I'm happy to see it and she has a beautiful body and an angel girl is even a beautiful and sweet girl !!! visit her 100%
If for some reason you are chatting with me without being truthful and honest with me about yourself then pass me by. I want someone local to arkansas,or surrounding states. I don't have a lot of.
i guess you know the other girl and know that he is involved with her? i wouldn't bring her up. just lay it on the line with the guy.
I'm a certified nursing istant at a nursing home. I'm a full time college student at Presentation college. and i am just looking to put some excitement into my life. I have been single for the last.
im a fun going extremist that likes to live my life!!i dont hold back and some times its bites me but things happen!anything else you wanna know feel free. If you want talk more Kik me I'm.
I can understand this..you took it personal. But good for you to recognize that this has to do with you and your expectations.
So you need a new behaviour which reduces your anxiety, without the nasty side-effect you're experiencing.

Her: Me too. She hasn’t eaten in a couple days and sick all over. She’s on a new diet hoping she’s better by tomorrow. She’s starving.
But here you have a man who demands his obviously innocent wife to prove she didn't cheat because he is insecure VS a woman who has some reasons to be insecure but should just ignore it cause you know, he's not doing anything wrong (or so he says)
Most have described me as a nice guy with a quick wit. Teasing in a caring sort of way. Polite and interesting conversationalist. Educated but 'down to earth'.
Don't let him make you feel bad, you have no reason to run off to another country to meet a stranger and if he is rude because you are uncomfortable or because you said "no" to this very unreasonable request my advice is..........don't talk to that particular person anymore! And good luck with your Spanish!

Ideally, an XP team consists of all talented and experienced people. Every person is assumed to have good communication skills, technical skills, ability to analyze and synthesize, understanding of business drivers, ability to make trade-offs based on business constraints and the ability to work as part of a team. Indeed, there probably are thousands of people who qualify on all these counts scattered around the world. But IT is a pervasive beast. It touches almost every aspect of modern business. IT is also labor intensive. The demand for really good people outstrips supply by a factor of hundred if not more. IT vendors who practice XP are therefore forced to move away from the ideal of more or less homogeneous poly-skilled teams.
Instead, we hire people who have a subset of the above skills and assign them to specific roles in a team. So we have roles like developer, analyst, QA, manager, UX dude/dudette etc. It is essential to recognize that this arrangement is a departure from the ideal - a compromise driven by market reality. How we look at roles depends on our model of the ideal world. If you agree with the XP ideal, then roles are labels attached to the activities on a project. e.g. performance tuning activity needs developer role, activity of scope negotiation needs manager role.
But all too often, we lose sight of the ideal and think of roles as labels attached to the people on a project. e.g. person A is a manager, anything she says outside her labeled area of competency should be taken with a pinch of salt, person B is a developer, anything she says outside her labeled area of competency should be taken with a pinch of salt, and so on. We forget that the labeled area of competency is merely a mutual agreement at the time of recruitment. We end up discounting the credibility of people outside their labeled domains.
This kind of thinking also magnifies capacity constraints in a team. Say we have 4 people with label QA and 12 people with label developer on a team. What happens when stories start piling up in QA? We are less likely to see if some developers can add temporary capacity to QA. Oh no, that would never do. Developers can't test. They are not wired to test. Mass stereotyping sets in.
Soon people start buying into their labels. Developers refuse to test. If you can communicate well, you are suspect as a developer. Managers shy away from writing code, or (shudder) gaining even basic user level technical competence. They go about saying "I can't handle technology", as if it were a feather in their cap. We become more and more entrenched in the silos created by our labels. Truly ploy-skilled people get disheartened in the process. A person with a label of analyst may have a great aptitude for domain modeling. But her inputs may be sidelined by developers. After a while she either starts believing in her artificial limitations or she starts looking for another job where her skills are more broadly appreciated.
It is no good to call everyone consultant and then use a different labeling scheme when it comes to staffing projects. To the extent of their skills, people should get to play multiple roles within a single project. Oh, that complicates staffing. So? Should the tail wag the dog?
Organized religion came about partly as a result of our need for identity and self-worth. It is probably reassuring to say "I belong to this group" and then move on to thinking "My group is better than the other group". We may have outgrown traditional organized religion but we seem to be falling for newer versions.
Your post is based on the false premise that roles can be interchanged arbitrarily. Let me explain myself:
Hardly: developers are able to fulfill testing roles but hardly ever the other way around. Managers programming? Nevermind that, unless they've grown from a core developer's position and then only recently and in de the same space (Java, .NET, etc.). Am I stereotyping now or am I speaking from experience, you know... from reality.
It is often claimed by Scrum evangelists that there should be no single point of failure and people should be able to fulfill most roles in their teams to provide high availability and increased predictability. Your post seems to underline exactly that notion. Your entire point seems to be increased availability for solving piled up stories. Congratulations, you've managed to reduced the level of various competencies and roles to the level of the lowest common denominator, a gray area that exceeds in no single quality. No, I'm not saying specializing is necessarily best, but it has been proven that the human mind produces the best and highest of quality products when it is doing what it likes, and it likes what it does best, especially when it is being recognized. It comes from and generates motivation, one of the primary pillars of a healthy team.
I dread the day my managers check in code and my testers assess story points. Especially when the reason is because stories are piling up as you say, in which case you've failed to apply Agile in the first place: One of the proclaimed notions of the Agile methodology is that stories *don't* pile up. That's the entire point: predictability, transparency, time management through abstraction, sprints, velocity to avoid piling up stories. Piling up in QA? This should never happen in an Agile setting to begin with. What, you're getting your stories tested in batches? That's not Agile at all. And even so, it is widely acknowledged that code is the most complex when it is arriving in its final stages; the codebase has arrived in a state where many bugs/workarounds/fixes have been applied already and the code inherently increases in complexion quadratically as everything needs to integrate with the rest. It is exactly in this stadium where non-professional or inexperienced 'developers' do the most harm. Hell, it's hard enough to get developers to develop a good product before this phase, let alone non-developers during!
Yes skills by extension, not by people but by activities. That was your point right, hiring people not based on a subset of skills but rather by what activities they could perform spanning multiple roles? Your gripe seems to be the hiring process geared towards singular roles, so you advocate a different mindset that allows for multi-disciplinary teams. This way other people can jump in secondary roles to handle piled up stories -conveniently the only example you mentioned as almost any other problem can't be solved this way, and you don't even need a different hiring procedure: any developer can take on a testing role-.
This is a Contradictio in terminis: You want a team that can handle arbitrary downspikes of any role (developer as QA tester), yet you counter my statement of the false premise of arbitrarily interchanging roles by falling back on the extend of specific skillsets of people. If taken to your absolute ideal, or maybe an exaggerated version, everyone can fulfill any role if the hiring process/mindset was fixed for this. And that's where my rant came in, as you end up with a mediocre at best team, since you would need jacks of all trade masters of none.
It's too bad you kept it so vague, because you'd realize the extend is rather short and unrealistic to be mentioned in a broader context.
I don't mean hiring/recruitment when I say 'staffing'. When I mean recruiment, I say 'recruitment'. 'Staffing' is also referred to as 'RM' (resource management) in consultancies. It is the act of building a team out of a bigger pool of talent. So my post is not a presciption to change the way we hire. I just want to encourage RM to recognize that people are multi-displicinary by nature. In the name of operational efficiency, our industrial society tries to coerce people into being uni-disciplinary cogs in its giant wheels. It ends up devaluing human potential in the process.
I don't care if you mean hiring or staffing, you're beating around the bush with wordplay. The point stands for staffing, which is to say you keep ending up with a mediocre team whose members can fulfill multiple roles.
Exemplary blogging: you've made no practical point with your post and failed to address any criticism by using either silly wordplay or the condescending strawmen card. Real mature.
Well, It seems like in such situation 'language' can be serious tool to define, or un-define, 'boundaries' of presumed roles. As you said, labeling everyone consultant might not be the right thing but there definitely is need for something more generic here. Do you think six-sigma sort of labeling in terms of experience in play-ground helps? Something like everyone is 12'th player but experience level (in being a 12'th player) matters when it comes to labeling (12'th player for 20 years might not be great example for cricket field though :))
I feel this is a natural 'evolution' as we move from specialist based approach to generic based approach. While I do no see it replacing the specialization based labeling but hiving off another 'acceptable' branch of skill recognition (and grading). Maybe we will soon see agile, super agile, cannot-rest-by-bum roles soon which will indicate resource's ability to be agile (even in accepting levels within role).
I don't know six sigma but I think labeling people should simply be avoided. Then how do we assign people to projects? Use a full text search on their professional profiles. Assuming they have described the work they have done, they will show up in relevant searches. I am assuming here that we don't want 'efficient', 'robotic' lookup and assignment of 'resources' to projects. The person in charge of staffing better know the people in question. Yes, this approach will not 'scale' but who says it must be necessarily scalable? This is just plain dogma of the knowledge industry.
Within historic houses furniture surfaces are often richly decorated which can lead to an increased risk of damage due to the different environmental responses of materials. These composite objects are extremely difficult to study and a systematic work assessing the damage caused by changing humidity and by exposure to light still needs to be performed and is the focus of this proposal. With wood having been assessed as the second most damaged material in English Heritage collections, a number of curatorial questions arise, which need to be answered in an interdisciplinary context. The management of furniture collections, particularly decorative surfaces which are extremely costly to perform conservation interventions on, could become even more difficult due to climate change.
Although these objects are well known to be at a great risk of damage, the unanswered questions are still very fundamental. How dry does the environment need to be for damage to occur? How fast does damage occur? How long does it have to be dry for damage to occur? There are also questions about what constitutes damage. Understanding how conservators, curators and the public feel about these questions can also inform decisions about how to manage and care for the collection and its display environment. Intensive cooperation with English Heritage curators and interpretation officers is therefore planned to answer these questions.
Experimental, as well as in situ research will be carried out in order to understand the effect of the display environment. Since small changes are difficult to measure, sensitive equipment is required in situ. The impact of modern scientific equipment within a historic interior also has to be assessed. After the sensitivity of objects to the environment is modelled, the integration of these models with environmental modelling will be attempted. This will allow for examination of various scenarios, informed by climate change predictions.
The outcomes of the project will be intensively disseminated, however, to increase project impact, studies will be performed on how to integrate the new knowledge on the sensitivity of decorated surfaces into heritage management practices, standards and guidelines.
This small exhibition describes the difficulties faced in preserving veneer and marquetry furniture at Kenwood House and the need for further research. Find out more about the range of methods used to understand the collection and improve its preservation. There is the opportunity to discover details of each technique and the information they provide on the collection at Kenwood House. The exhibition will give visitors a better understanding of the types of scientific monitoring used and the research undertaken on collections. It should also help explain how this information can help improve the care of the collections for future generations.
No booking required. Exhibition will be on-site as part of the normal house opening. Free admission.

Today we live in a highly competitive world in which only one thing is certain for companies - change. Intelligent companies continually seek to adapt in order to seize new opportunities that arise. Entrepreneurial organisations transform themselves, this is known as re-invention.
An entrepreneurial organisation looks for opportunities to use all resources more effectively. An organisation with an entrepreneurial culture will actively seek change and be quick to respond. It will be ‘market-led’ and prepared to take risks. For this to be possible, the organisation must have a flexible structure that enables re-invention.
This case study examines how, in the late 1990s, Gardner Merchant re-invented itself from a position of contract caterer in business and industry to become a true multi-service provider, capable of satisfying outsourcing requirements for a wide range of people-based services.
Gardner Merchant is a member of Sodexho Alliance. Sodexho is the largest food and management services company in the world, with a global turnover of £6.3 billion Euros, operations in 66 countries, 250,000 employees and 18,700 operating units. Gardner Merchant is the UK operation of Sodexho and focuses on local delivery of service on a site by site basis, with 50,000 permanent staff at 3,500 client locations providing catering and support services.
The 1990s saw the transformation of most large companies in the United Kingdom. Previously, companies grew very large, employing great numbers of people and managing services such as security, building facilities, public relations, and transport.
Following a turnaround in business thinking, organisations started to downsize, to strip out non-core activities and concentrate on their strongest assets. Large companies began to outsource many of their non-core activities - they used outside contractors to provide them with goods and services which were not part of their core business. This created a tremendous opportunity for companies to concentrate on meeting the requirements of large companies for specialist services.

Over here in Geneva, the Laboratory was involved in the Lift 12 conference with various activities. Fabien attended the event and Nicolas is part of the editorial team and, as such, he took care of one third of the keynotes presentations with sessions about games, stories, mobile and near futures. He also organized three workshops, one about networked data (with Interactive Things), one about location-based games (with Mathieu Castelli) and another one about foresight methodologies (with Justin Pickard and Anab Jain from Superflux). The week was therefore very active and it was a great event overall. Lots of encounters with good people, new ideas and existing memes (it’s now time to digest all of those).
Well, here in Los Angeles we mostly were working on, oh — let’s call it Marshall Stack. It’s a Project. It’s another project along with Ear Freshener that belongs to the Project Audio Suite. It was some very pragmatic, tactical bits of work that we were doing which meant corralling the team, especially the instrumental implementors — the engineers. It also meant writing up a UX specification but doing it in a non-tedious but very clear way. No boxes and arrows. It’s narrative. It’s more a story than flow chart, which I like. My hope is that it engages people in a way that a story does, rather than making people’s eyeballs glaze over and close as a flow chart or wireframe potentially can do. There was some good, very promising engagement with the technology team who come across as confident and certainly capable. But there’s always that nagging concern that comes from a twinge of engineers’ over-confidence. When idioms like “we can just smash this”, “correct me if i’m wrong — but this smells like just a weekend project” — a little bell goes off in my head that is a mix of “great! this’ll go smooth” and “hold on..but *how and which weekend are we going to smash it?”
Part of the job of creative lead in this case is, I think, to run ahead of that end of things as, at this point — it’s the known unknown. Meaning — there isn’t certainty as to how to implement this although it is definitely possible — we’re not trying to get to Mars or make a cold fusion reactor in a mayonnaise jar. This is entirely doable. It’s now time (4 weeks), enthusiasm and motivation and quite a bit of good, engaging story telling that will put a lovely frame around the experience.
I’m doing some detailed logging of the evolution of Marshall Stack because I think there are some good procedural lessons in the project. The bump and shove of a project and where things get lost and where new things get found. The evolution of things from initial aspiration to a sudden simplification; how different aspects of a project get culled in the interests of expediency. Ways of communicating and sharing and discovering new facets of a concept. Etc. We’ll see. It’ll make for a good postmortem narrative, or whatever you’d call it.

"The statement by the Israeli association comes as a debate is being conducted by the American Anthropological Association about a boycott on Israel".
If anything can be learned from the case of South Africa it’s that one cannot expect boycotts alone to change the situation.
"Two recent reports suggest that Israel could face catastrophic consequences if it fails to end the mistreatment of Palestinians under its rule, whether in the occupied territories or in Israel itself... If the watching world really wants peace, economic wishful thinking will not suffice. It is past the time simply for carrots. Sticks are needed too".
"We are Jews from the United States, who, like Jewish people throughout the world, have an automatic right to Israeli citizenship under Israel’s “law of return.” Today there are more than seven million Palestinian refugees around the world. Israel denies their right to return to their homes and land — a right recognized and undisputed by UN Resolution 194, the Geneva Convention, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Meanwhile, we are invited to live on that same land simply because we are Jewish. We renounce this “right” to “return” offered to us by Israeli law. It is not right that we may “return” to a state that is not ours while Palestinians are excluded and continuously dispossessed".
James ZOGBY: "BDS: A Legitimate and Moral Response to Israeli Policy" (The Huffington Post, The Blog, June 13, 2015).
The Israeli government response to the "Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions"(BDS) movement has been predictable. Being incapable of engaging in any reasonable form of self-criticism or even self-reflection, Israeli leaders have, instead, turned their wrath on their accusers and their victims.
As the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement grows, its co-founder, Omar Barghouti, has become a target for Israeli demonization. +972's Rami Younis sits down with Barghouti for a rare discussion about BDS's goals, its recent successes, and increasingly frequent accusations that the boycott movement constitutes anti-Semitism.
Ali ABUNIMAH: "Israeli universities help Shin Bet torturers recruit students" (The Electronic Intifada, 12 June 2015; Haaretz, 11 June: "Israeli universities providing data on graduates to Shin Bet. Security service uses information to contact possible new recruits", by Chaim Levinson).
Israeli universities are passing on personal information about their students to Israel’s Shin Bet secret police. According to Haaretz, the universities give the internal intelligence agency (which is notorious for its use of torture) lists of their graduates, including identity card numbers, to use in an effort to recruit them. The revelation will likely bolster support for the international boycott of Israeli universities called for by Palestinians.
The bulk of recent incidents concerning the anti-Israel boycott, which are mainly symbolic for now, could have served as a warning sign. But a mixture of nationalistic and false statements is blinding the Israeli public and preventing a real discussion of the issue. Here are a few examples...
Akiva ELDAR: "Anti-boycott call rings hollow as village awaits demolition" (Al Monitor, June 9, 2015).
Israeli plans to demolish the Palestinian village of Susiya and other similar acts will not generate support for the government's campaign to stanch the growing movement to boycott settlement products and in some cases products made in Israel.
Gideon LEVY: "Israeli propaganda isn't fooling anyone – except Israelis" (Haaretz, June 4, 2015; some extracts in: Philip Weiss, "Levy says BDS may undo Israeli denial and propaganda– even as Lapid calls it Hamas’s ‘puppet’", Mondoweiss, June 7).
"...It’s only to be expected when facing a worldwide campaign aimed at implementing justice and international law: the stage of denial, of repression and clinging to the false, nearly magical belief that if Israel will just explain its position better and invest the appropriate resources [so-called 'hasbara'], everything will be fine. In other words, Israel continues to think that the world is dumb (and Israel is smart)...You can blame the Palestinians for everything and obscure the simple fact that this brutal occupation is Israeli. You can tell the world that it all belongs to us because the Bible says so and believe that anyone will take you seriously. You can be sure that the memory of the Holocaust will serve us forever, and justify any injustice. Of course, it won’t work indefinitely. It hasn’t worked in any country in history, no matter how strong and well-established, not even in the mightiest empires. Justice always triumphs in the end, even if very belatedly. And justice says that Israel cannot continue to tyrannize another people forever, even if Haim Saban himself lends his support."

L1 news March 22, 2016. Today in Maastricht: André Rieu accompanies HM Queen Elizabeth II on the red carpet from his castle and they drove in a Limousine to the Vrijthof. What is going on?? “André Rieu composes a waltz for the British Queen. Orchestra leader and violinist Andre Rieu records a waltz specially for the 90th birthday of the British queen. This is being reported by 1Limburg (local media) and the Dutch newspaper “De Telegraaf”. HM Queen Elizabeth II will reach the age of 90 on April 21st 2016. For the accompanying video clip, a look alike of the Queen arrived in Maastricht this Monday morning. The video clip will show Rieu and the British 'Queen' walking the red carpet. From the violinist's castle the couple went to the Vrijthof Square in a Limousine, where they also made recordings. It's not the first time Rieu composes a piece of music for the British royal house. To honor the British Queen's jubilee a few years ago, Rieu already composed a Coronation Waltz. Later Rieu composed a waltz for the inauguration of King Willem Alexander of the Netherlands (also called the Coronation Waltz)”. We can see that the “King” and the “Queen” have much fun together! And we look forward to see the video clip of the Windsor Waltz! “Style lookalikes” revealed us the name of the Queen Lookalike: Mary Reynolds, from Harrow, Middlesex, UK. Thank you “Style Lookalikes” for your mail!

Although it is rare, if you happen to have any questions that we are not 100% certain about the answer, we will consult the National Wood Floor Association to make sure the answer we give you is correct. We are a member of the NWFA, so you know you can trust our advice.
A: This is a matter of opinion. If you wait until after the floors are done, you will need to clean the walls, etc. before painting and you will need to be certain that no paint gets on the floor because it is difficult to remove without marring the finish. You will need to cover the floor completely with a drop sheet -all the way to the edges of the room. Do not apply any kind of tape to the floor.
If you choose to paint before the floors are done, it’s a good idea to leave the baseboard and 1/4 round unpainted because the edging machine usually leaves a small mark near the floor along the edge, and this could be covered when the baseboards and 1/4 round are finally painted. If your 1/4 round (or baseboards) are not yet installed, it is actually a good idea to leave them off during the installation or sanding and finishing to allow sanding of the entire floor right up to the walls. This provides a nice flat base for the trim to sit on. At the very least, leave the painted 1/4 round until after the floors are finished. You will end up with a cleaner appearance.
Keep in mind if you paint beforehand, that you will have to wipe everything down after sanding. Even though we clean up after we have sanded, there is usually a fine dust that clings to walls, etc.
A: If you have a forced-air furnace system with a humidity control, this is the ideal situation and you can successfully do floors at any time of year. Because wood expands and contracts with changes in humidity, the use of the humidistat kept between 35-45% will minimize this movement. If you do not have a humidistat, then the contraction of the wood is most noticeable in the winter when the air is dry. The resulting gaps in the joints of the boards will close up again in the summer months when humidity is slightly higher. It is for this reason that you are probably better off installing hardwood in the winter when the pieces of wood are at their minimum dimensions, they’ll go together tightly when they expand in the summertime. They should go back to their original positions, without much indication of movement to occur. Sometimes gaps result in some of the joints that do not completely go away. This is not the fault of the installation or a defect in the material, but a normal condition of the behaviour of wood.
If you are building a new home, it is important to have the heating system installed (and the humidistat set at 45%, if applicable) before the flooring is delivered to the job site. The wood should be introduced into conditions similar to those of the living conditions. Wood that is installed in a house without heat, especially in cool months will not behave properly once heat and humidity levels are changed (upon moving in). This is something that is quite often overlooked by builders and can play an important role in the performance of the completed floor.
Q: During new home construction or major renovations, what is the best time to install/finish wood floors?
A: Sometimes wood floors are installed at the wrong time during construction, from unawareness to rushed situations where too many things are going on at once at the job site. Hardwood can be installed long before it must be sanded and finished, which is actually an ideal procedure provided the floor is adequately protected from dirt, water, mortar and grout, etc. This allows the flooring to physically get used to its surroundings. The building should be at the same temperature and humidity levels as comfortable living conditions, 61-71 degrees and 45% humidity. Flooring installed before these conditions can be damaged. When the building is finally lived in, the floor may “move” dimensionally due to the drastic swing in temperature or humidity and may have to be resanded, etc. It is not always practical or possible to have flooring installed this far ahead of finishing. Flooring can be successfully installed and finished in less time provided the conditions exist before flooring is delivered to the job site. Often these factors are overlooked by the hurried contractor and can result in an expensive lesson to be learned. Knowing this ahead of time will assure the best possible performance and life from your hardwood floor.
Leaving wood floors done while there are other tradesmen in the area usually creates havoc and should be avoided. The floor man must ensure good conditions in order to do a proper, dust-free job. These can all be altered by vibrations in the walls (from hammering, etc.) that can dislodge particulate that lands on wet finishes. Simply opening a door when it is windy outside can ruin a freshly finished floor, even if the door is nowhere near the floor. Also, tradesmen walking across the floor, using ladders, extension cords running across the floor, etc. can all have an impact on the outcome of the floor.
The best time to do most of the work on wood floors is after everyone else is finished, except for maybe the final coat of paint on trim.

Consistent with this observation, the percentage of labeled mitosis (PLM) analysis showed a notable increase in the time of the G0/G1 phase.

If you were to look up the creator of the saying “no day is ever the same here”, you will find that they were a Plasma employee. 2017 has been another great year of innovation and progress. At Plasma we are always thinking about the things we will do next, so grab a nice winter warming drink of your choice (mulled cider for me) and take some time out to think of all that we have achieved.
There is lots written about all the clever things we are doing for our customers and our sector, so let’s chat about all the amazing things we have done as a team. We have welcomed over 70 exceptionally talented contractors and permanent team members. The South West is full of some very big, impressive companies but we continue to attract the best. I know it’s not our coffee, so it must be the very interesting work we do for our customers and the opportunities we offer. More than 20% of us enjoyed a promotion, a role change and/or took on some additional responsibilities. It is great to see the number of people progressing through the technical career ladder into Lead, Senior and Associate Fellow roles.
Despite our growth, we maintained our commitment to our training and development. We increased our Graduate and Apprenticeship intake and the number of people on our Management Development, Operational Excellence and Early Careers Programmes. We invested in personalised line management development programmes, Kepler Tragoes Analytical Problem Solving and more. Congratulations to all of you studying externally, from Bachelors to Masters Degrees. Graduation (and the graduation party) is now in your sights. Thanks to everyone who attended numerous external courses at Universities and Conferences and brought their learning back into Plasma. We started our Partners in Leadership Accountability Builder Training with our leadership teams around our business, based on the Oz Principle of getting results through individual and organisational accountability.
One of our highlights was our Early Careers Programme participants who undertook three month secondments to other OI sites, including our business’s in California. They made such an impact we nearly had to kidnap them back. It has been a privilege to support post and pre doctoral students through sponsorship and time in our business.
We always want to learn more about other sectors and continued our programme of getting out to other best practice organisations in Operations and Health and Safety. Our Innovation Development team have also been out sourcing the most up to date thinking and bringing back new processes and techniques to embed innovation, from Coffee House meetings to creating innovation spaces around our site.
Our local community and environment has been a big focus for us this year. Thank you to everyone who has been involved in all of our Go Green initiatives, especially Louise and Rita, from planting and wildlife protection to sustainable Travel. A very big thank you to all of you who have devoted time to careers fairs, local school visits and providing work experience to promote STEM subjects.
There is so much more we have done but you have probably finished your winter warmer drink now and it’s time you reached for that chocolate. Just one more won’t hurt. Big Christmas wishes to you and your family!
The 50’s and 60’s witnessed legendary filmmakers like Bimal Roy, Mehboob Khan, Guru Dutt and Raj Kapoor, who had the amazing potential to infuse art and commercial elements in the making of a movie thus making potboilers like MADHUMATI, MOTHER INDIA, PYASA, AWAARA etc.
Decades later Rajkumar Hirani better recognized as Raju Hirani has attained the same credentials as the above mentioned legends. His movies have the same ingredients that keep people in splits straight till the end with just the right amount of emotions. November 22, marks the birthday of Raju Hirani , who is making waves these days thanks to his upcoming movie PK. Raaga.Com wishes Raju Hirani happy returns of the day and pray he continues to entertain with quality cinema.
Readers would be surprised to know Raju Hirani is perhaps the only film director in Bollywood who has the prestige of giving a hat trick of successful films viz. MUNNA BHAI MBBS (2003), LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI (2006) AND 3 IDIOTS (2009). Even the legendary Bimay Roy could not achieve this feat. His first two films PARINEETA (1953) AND DO BIGHA ZAMIN (1953) were super hits but his third film NAUKARI (1954) was a dud at box office.
With PK Raju Hirani’s credentials are at stake because if he hits the bull’s eye yet again at the box office with PK then he will prove why he is called- The director with golden touch!
On being quizzed 3 IDIOTS did 200 crore business will PK break the record. Raju says, “ For me a movie makes Rs 100 crore or Rs 200 crore is a number, nothing more. Yes, a movie should do well business-wise, as, after all, it is an industry but not at the cost of good content.” He adds, “ For me a good content is more important than money. It’s sad a movie’s success is judged only by the money it makes.”
Hirani, who shares a warm relation with Sanjay Dutt on being asked about the biopic on Sanjay Dutt said, “The movie is only one tenth of Dutt's life which the world knows. In the same breath he also added that, despite everything he has gone through, there is an honest child inside Sanjay Dutt.”
Aamir Khan with his array of super hit films like 3 IDIOTS, DHOOM 3, LAGAAN etc has not only fans in India but has fans around the globe. However any guesses whom does Aamir Khan adores?
Well the secret was recently revealed when Mr. Perfectionist aka Aamir Khan was left awestruck when he met Hollywood’s superstar and Mr. Universe Arnold Schwarzenegger at summit in New Delhi.
According to reports Schwarzenegger is in India for a Summit. Incidentally, Bollywood star Aamir Khan was also attending the same summit. And the two happened to meet each other. Elated at meeting Schwarzenegger, in person, Aamir was so excited that he tweeted, ““It was a bizzare feeling! I looked up when the door opened and I see THE TERMINATOR walking into my room!.”
Aamir Khan in his tweet revealed that he was in New Delhi for HT Summit but when he came to know that Arnold Schwarzenegger is also present for the summit he requested the HT officials to give him a chance to meet him.
Tweets Aamir, “I told the HT staff I wish I could meet Arnold Schwarzenegger. So they told him. And he just walked in to my room!!!”
Speaking about his meeting with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Aamir Khan reveals, “He’s really cool. Very warm and friendly.”
Aamir Khan is such an avid fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger that he says, “I’m a huge fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger! And I love him not only for his body, but also for his movies. I think he’s an underrated actor!”
After Bharat Ratna Lata Mangeshkar, star of millennium Amitabh Bachchan became the second recipient to receive the prestigious 2nd Yash Chopra memorial award. Dedicated to the memory of the late producer-director, the Yash Chopra Memorial Award has been instituted by the TSR Foundation of T. Subbarami Reddy.
Announcing the award an elated T. Subbarami Reddy briefing the media said, “The award is given to deserving and prominent figures from the Indian cinema for their outstanding contributions in diverse fields. This year the jury members unanimously decided Amitabh Bachchan as he definitely deserves the award.”
SimiGarewal, the eminent Bollywood actress and member of jury candidly confessed, “As a jury, when we were thinking about Amitabh Bachchan for this award, we didn't even have to catch a breath. Everyone was unanimous of the fact that he is deserved it."
Amitabh Bachchan will be conferred the award in December this year, the date hasn't been decided yet. The award consists of a gold medal and prize money Rs. 10 lakhs.
The award is quite apt for Big B because Amitabh Bachchan besides having dedicated his entire life to Indian film industry shared a warm relation with Yash Chopra. It was with Yash Chopra, who gave Bachchan some of his most memorable hits like DEEWAAR (1975), KABHI KABHIE (1976), TRISHUL (1978), KAALA PATTHAR (1979), SILSILA (1981).
In fact it was Yash Chopra who dared to change Amitabh Bachchan’s angry man image into a romantic poet in KABHI KABHIE and SILSILA.
Further when Amitabh Bachchan was in financial crises after the failure of his home production ABCL (Amitabh Bachchan Corporation Ltd) it was once again Yash Chopra, who gave a new lease of life to Amitabh Bachchan with his hit film MOHABBATEIN (2000) and opened doors of stardom yet again!

Patrick STRICKLAND: "New bill would ban boycott advocates from entering Israel" (The Electronic Intifada, June 10, 2015).
A right-wing lawmaker plans to introduce a bill to ban foreign nationals who support boycotting Israel from visiting the country, the newspaper Haaretz reports. Yinon Magal, a member of the ultra-nationalist Habayit Hayehudi (Jewish Home) party, is now attempting to recruit fellow lawmakers to support his bill. If passed, the bill would ban supporters of the Palestinian call for boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) from visiting present-day Israel and the occupied West Bank and Gaza. It would also bar foreign nationals of Jewish ancestry who support boycotting Israel from obtaining Israeli citizenship.
Israeli cultural, as well as academic, institutions will always claim that the boycott infringes upon their freedom and punishes artists and academics who are the most “progressive” and opposed to “the occupation” in Israeli society. This argument, aside from being quite disingenuous, is in fact intended to deflect attention from three basic facts : first, that the boycott was called for because Israel was denying Palestinians their basic rights, including academic and cultural rights ; second, that the Palestinian academic and cultural boycott of Israel targets institutions, not individuals ; and third, that those institutions, far from being more progressive than the average in Israel, are a main pillar of the Israeli structure of colonial and apartheid oppression.
The Israeli obsession with showing ‘our side’ of the story not only guzzles financial and human resources — it is a conscious attempt to distract the world from policies of occupation.
A male anchor on Israel’s Ynet news provided vivid insight into the state of Israeli freedom of speech this week with his reaction to a Jewish-Israeli guest who supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement aimed at holding the state to account for its breaches of international and human rights law.
Mark BROWN: "Film-makers ask cinemas and Bafta to boycott London Israeli film festival" (The Guardian, June 8, 2015).
More than 40 artists and film-makers write to the Guardian to accuse cinemas of becoming ‘silent accomplices’ to the persecution of the Palestinian people... The letter says that because the festival is co-sponsored by the Israeli government via its London embassy there is a direct link between the cinemas, the screenings and Israeli government policies... The letter stresses it is not a request to refuse to show films by individual film-makers “but to reject the involvement and financial support of the Israeli state”.
"Government efforts to fight ‘Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions’ are bolstering the movement and creating the political debate the campaign seeks to achieve.
... A number of artists recently announced that they will cancel their performances in Israel, intensifying the sense of many Israelis that their country is becoming increasingly isolated. As the British National Union of Students this month publicly endorsed BDS, senior Israeli university officials approached the Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, warning of a growing academic boycott...".
Gideon LEVY: "For the sins of occupation, boycotts are a light punishment" (Haaretz, Opinion, June 7, 2015; medium.com).
"...Does anyone think that Israel can go on without being punished? Without being ostracized? And to tell the truth, doesn’t Israel deserve to be punished? Hasn’t the world been unbelievably tolerant so far? Orange or SodaStream, academic boycott or artistic boycott, these are light punishments. The penalties will grow worse the longer Israel avoids drawing the necessary conclusions. As opposed to attempts by Israel and the Jewish establishment to divert the discussion, at its heart is not anti-Semitism. At its heart is the occupation. That is the source of the delegitimization... ".
"First such event held by the sociology and anthropology department, and possibly the university; fact that discussion did not completely condemn BDS, and included some expressions of support, is considered unusual.
Chris McGREAL: "Sheldon Adelson looks to stamp out growing US movement to boycott Israel" (The Guardian, June 5, 2015).
"Billionaire gambling magnate and Republican party donor convenes closed-door meeting to combat US university movement amid growing Israeli alarm over growing Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign in US and Europe".
...Clearly, academic freedom is an inviolable principle that should be defended, but it remains an illusion for the Palestinians under occupation since 1948. The BDS does not weaken supposedly neutral and liberal spaces of critical knowledge, as its moderate detractors often argue, it rather represents the beginning of a process that aims to extend freedom to all.
"The British National Union of Students voted to boycott Israeli companies and align with the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement" (Forward, June 2, 2015).
"In a 19-4 vote with one abstention, the confederation of 600 student unions across the United Kingdom passed the pro-BDS proposal on Tuesday at a meeting of its National Executive Council. The motion “condemns Israeli military presence in the West Bank and Gaza,” according to the Jewish Chronicle, and calls on students to “co-ordinate a nationwide student day of action to commemorate UN Palestine Solidarity Day” on Nov. 29. Titled "Solidarity with Palestine: Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions", the motion was proposed by the School of Oriental and African Studies students union in London".

In the fog-filled Scottish Highlands of 1457, a sensual dare brings together a fiery lass and a mysterious suitor - but it will take more for them to discover they've fallen in love....
The fiercely handsome Vincent Danzel never backs away from a dare. So, when he's challenged to make a particular young lady fall in love with him without taking her to his bed, he jumps at the chance to woo the unsuspecting lass to her knees...
Sybil Eschoncan's visions warn her that an unsuitable man will enter her life, and Vincent's sudden appearance confirms her prediction. But she's unprepared for her wild attraction to the rake - and perplexed by his unwillingness to claim her...
Vincent vows to resist his mounting desire, even as Sybil's every word intrigues him and her every touch ignites his senses. But when another man lays claim to the tempting maid, Vincent must risk everything to fight for the love he never expected to find....
Sybil dipped her head and slanted her shoulder and made a move around him in a dismissive fashion. He took a sideways step and blocked her. Sybil looked at his feet and then tried again. This time she moved to the other side of the hall, taking three steps and gaining a half-step forward of progress. One of his sideways lunges however and she was blocked again. She blew the slightest sigh through her lower lip, making it puff out and a wisp of her hair flutter.
Sybil ran her gaze up the mass of flesh he was displaying for her and met his eyes. The wretch was smiling. He was openly doing it now and showing full teeth. She tilted her head to one side and regarded him, forcefully ignoring every bit of how it felt. Every bit. Especially the itch of sensation at each breast tip, where she must have donned an under dress that hadn"t been rinsed thoroughly because it chaffed with what had to be lye residue. Especially there.
Sybil pulled in a breath and complied, giving her voice the most enticing, sensual, deep-throated undertone she knew how, as she drew the first syllable of his name out in a lengthy fashion before finishing it with a moan of sound.
The reaction was immediate and visual. The mass of man jumped slightly as if an itch of sensation made it inevitable. Sybil was around him and almost down the hall before she heard his boots coming after her.
She stopped, turned fully and put both hands out, blocking his way for a change. She was watching his reaction as he slowed to a crawl of movement and then halted just shy of her, and just stood there, breathing deeply. Sybil was matching him but kept the beginnings of agitation to herself.
"I"m na" delaying you," he replied. And gave that little smirk-smile that came with one dimple. "At least....na" this time."
She took a deep breath. "My step-mother is a verra gracious woman. Anymore. Especially to me. I dinna wish any of that changed," she replied.
His confusion was almost perfectly portrayed. Sybil had never met a better liar. Poser. Deviant. Her eyes narrowed even more.
""Tis obvious to me, my toad price. You are one of my step-mother"s newest lovers. She has them. Ever since my father"s death in spring of last year there has been a string of handsome young men about the castle. All dancing attendance on her. Without end. â€˜Tis her reward for the life she lived with him. I doona" begrudge it to her."
That was odd. She didn"t like odd. She swallowed the excess spittle her mouth was cursing her with and continued, making certain he knew of her knowledge.
"Dinna" let it fash you." She ran her eyes up and down his frame and ended up back to his belly, where a roping of muscle was still moving with his heart pounding. "You are by far the most handsome. Much. She sees well. It"s my guess, she"ll na" be dismissing you as quickly as she does the others. Unless you give her reason."
She finished on a whisper. He was choking. It sounded in his next words. He was a terrible choice for a lover. He wasn"t even loyal. Sybil was already thinking through the selection of herbs she could use. The Lady of Eschon didn"t deserve such a cheat and a wretch. Both of which he was proving himself to be the longer he bothered the only other young female in the castle: Lady Sybil.
He was stammering through it and that started the most entertaining flush to his cheeks. Sybil watched it. The man was extremely handsome. She had to give him that. He was more than handsome. He was a stunning, beautiful specimen and the flush was making the gold of his eyes glow. Her stepmother had let her eyes be her guide this time. She hadn"t looked beyond that.
Sybil had it decided. She was going to use crushed and dried chicory on him. She pulled in her lower lip in thought, wondering at the exact portion that wouldn"t prostrate him with sickness but would have him visiting the castle latrine more oft than he could Lady Eschon"s bedchamber.
He grunted. Then he moved a step toward her, standing above her and breathing hard on her, and making her regret the outstretched arms and aggressive stance. Especially since she"d been the one assuming it. Oh! He was getting a double dose of chicory with bruised leaves. Enough to cause gastric distress for a sennight. That"s what was happening to him, she decided.
He reached a hand to touch her chin and lift it. She had two choices. Give up her stance, wrap her cloak about herself and try to escape him again, or wait. Bide her time. Create the events that would serve her intent and not his. She narrowed her eyes to make her choice less noticeable for him.
"What if I were to tell you that the moment I set eyes on you this morn, nae other woman existed...anymore?" he murmured, in such a soft, seductive tone Sybil nearly believed it. Almost. He was good. Amazingly good. And he had a voice like warm butter. He was the best one Lady Eschon had enticed to her side. Easily.
"Other than remarking that such a thing would definitely give her reason to replace you, I"d have only one thing to say," she replied.
"And...that would be?" He moved closer, but it wasn"t by moving his feet. Or if he was, she didn"t hear it. Since he had a forefinger beneath her chin and was still forcing her to look up at him, she wouldn"t have seen it, anyway. She watched him lean a bit closer to her, roamed her eyes all about his face for something to look at other than the mesmerizing quality of those gold-enhanced dark eyes, and had to swallow the increased spittle in her mouth. She knew he felt it.
He blinked a dark fringe of lash, shadowing the honey color into opaque black before letting it back.
"What condition might that be?" He was tilting his head and slanting forward even closer, pulling her to her tiptoes with the lifting of his hand at her chin. And with pursed lips he was a completely devastating sight. If she were a female that cared for such things.
Sybil gulped. "Poor...eyesight." She managed to whisper it and then watched as he lowered the dark brush of eyelashes he had. That was tantamount to closing his eyes. She wondered at the man"s sanity. And bravery. And idiocy.
The moment before he"d have touched his lips to hers, she moved. The hall could have him. She was finished with this nonsense.
"Steamy sensuality and quick-witted dialogue make ONCE UPON A KNIGHT delightfully entertaining, while emotional issues are touchingly captivating." - SingleTitles.com
"I loved Vincent"s utter fascination with Sybil and I enjoyed how the two of them verbally sparred. In the conversations between them, much is left unsaid, leaving the two characters to depend on other clues to determine motives. Sybil made Vincent work and he needed to work. Also, I appreciated their attraction to each other, which brought the sexual tension up a notch. Put simply, I liked Sybil as she"s strong and has learned to take care of herself." - All About Romance Novels

Looking for a quick getaway that has all the makings of an Adult Disneyland? Then look no further than Viva Las Vegas.
My sister-in-law, Natasha, had never been to Vegas and since my friend, Bucky, was headlining in a show and colleagues were attending the JCK, it seemed like the perfect weekend to go for broke (no pun intended)!! Girls Trip!!
There are lots of great and affordable airlines traveling to LV this time of year – so while the temperatures are rising, take advantage of the low $$ for travel. Pack a carry-on only; don’t waste a minute of your time at baggage claim and heaven forbid your luggage gets lost. It’s a quick trip: 2 tops, 1 bottom, a bathing suit & cover up, 2 dresses, 1 pair of heels and a pair of flip flops . . . that’s all you need!!
Once you arrive, be prepared to wait in line for a taxi. This line appears to be never ending, depending upon the time & day of arrival, but it moves quicker then Space Mountain and there’s some pretty good people watching along the way.
Once you get to your hotel, you may also encounter a long line to check in. Understand, Vegas truly never sleeps, so people are checking in & out at all hours of the day. Join the Total Rewards program online so you have a member number, as most casinos have a special check-in line & tons of discount for members . . . and it’s free to join. And always smile, be courteous and ask for an upgrade. I found that being kind (that and a discreet tip to the person checking you in) will pay off handsomely in the long run. You’re not in your room for most of the day, but a higher floor, better view and executive lounge privileges can sure make your stay that much sweeter.
Shopping in Vegas is just insane! It’s the best of NYC, LA, London, Paris and your favorite mall all wrapped up on one long strip. From the highest end boutiques to the most convenient of touristy shops – you could literally arrive there empty handed and go home with an entirely new wardrobe!!
If you love to eat like me, you’ll be in a gastronomical paradise!! From the mom & pop diners to your favorite celebrity chefs, there are a gazillion opportunities to tantalize your taste buds. Enjoy breakfast in Rome, lunch in Paris and dinner in NYC . . . it’s a culinary feast of the senses. Don’t have a reservation? No prob! Be flexible, go on an off hour, be willing to sit at the bar, smile . . . and don’t forget to tip the guy or gal that squeezes you in without much of a wait!!
Entertainment abounds in Vegas, from the biggest headliners, to musical reviews, cabarets, comedy and everything in between. If you’re worried about seeing that one big showstopper, then perhaps book in advance. But I found walking up to the ticket counter was just as easy, you see the actual venue & there are no overpriced service charges from a third party! Perhaps the best secret is that house seats are ‘on hold’ until the day of the show for special guests of the headliners, etc. If you’re at the right place at the right time, a coveted seat may be yours!!!
Want to feel inspired? The various hotels are all incredibly different and feature one-of-a-kind architecture and design features that are truly museum quality. Be sure to allow some time to just wander from one place to the next to the next . . .
Finally . . . it’s totally hothothot in Vegas and you must stay hydrated!! Carry h2o with you at all times and wear sunscreen. If hanging out by the pool, rent a covered cabana or lounge chairs that offer you shade and protection. While they can be $100-200 for the day, with food/beverage minimums . . . it’s completely worth it for you to have a place to hang your hat, take a little nap if you stayed out too late the night before and just enjoy the wild and wacky pool scene. When it’s 114 degrees outside, getting burned and blistered can happen quicker then you think and ruin the rest of your trip!
Yep, you really can do Vegas in 48 hours and survive!! And, if you happen to get caught up on one or more of these steps, just remember:

Belarusian jurists doubt in the legitimacy of president Lukashenko's candidacy at the upcoming presidential election in October 2015. Meanwhile, the Belarusian constitutional court does not see any reason to examine the case.
On June 22, well before the October voting, a group of Belarusian jurists around Tamara Kovalchuk called on the constitutional court to scrutinize several legal inconsistencies, which concern the current presidency of Alexander Lukashenko. They cast doubt on the legitimacy of his candidacy at the upcoming presidential election.
The jurists mainly appeal to paragraph 112 of the current election law of the Belarusian Republic, which regulates the thematic scope of national referenda. One passage explicitly excludes those questions, which concern "the election or the dismissal of the president of the Republic of Belarus". But that is exactly what happened on October 17 in 2004 when people were asked whether they allowed "the first president of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, to take part as a candidate at the presidential election of the Republic of Belarus".
To understand the context, we must remember that the second term of incumbent Lukashenko's presidency came closer to its end and the constitution of that time limited the presidency to two terms. According to official results, almost 88 % of voters affirmed the question and thereby the according modification of the constitution. Because of legal inconsistencies like the above-mentioned, Kovalchuk and her colleagues regard the 2004 referendum, and following presidential elections in 2006 and 2010 illegal.
Without responding to any details, the Belarusian constitutional court reacted some weeks later with a one-page letter, which briefly stated, that "reasons to initiate a proceedings could not be established". Discussions on that topic were deleted from Belarusian news pages, Kovalchuk reported.
Although Ukraine and Belarus have chosen opposite directions of political development, their systems remain very representative for the whole post-soviet area. Considering their very essence, those two paths may lead to the same destination. It was visible especially in the context of the last presidential elections.
In both Ukraine and Belarus things are seemingly clear. In Belarus everything revolves around the “essential” president, Alexander Lukashenko, who is doing his best to remain in power as long as possible. His foreign policy, despite some fluctuations, is mostly Russia-oriented, as the nieghbour is the main guarantor of Belarusian internal and external stability.
Ukraine paints the picture of a great struggle to reach status of a fully “European” and “democratic” country. Its whole political agenda focuses on strategy of rapid exit from the zone of Russian influence as well as on the great promise of deep social and economic reforms. Its political system bases on democratic and free market mechanisms. O at least it looks like that at the very first glance.
Recent local elections in Ukraine reveal an image that western media would rather keep quiet about. The “wild” electoral campaign has exceeded previous standards and the level of political brutality has doubled comparing with elections in 2011. The source is mainly the internal conflicts that tear the country from the inside. Political powers formed during the post-Maidan wave of changes become exactly the same thing that the Maidan was fighting against: exclusive groups of interests taking care mainly of their own posts.
President Poroshenko’s “Solidarity” movement has quickly turned into a typical post-soviet party of power with no ideological orientation, no concrete program and no intellectual base. The President still has not fulfilled his electoral promises about giving up his lucrative businesses. Thus, he has not applied the “anti-oligarchy policy” even for himself. Moreover, his political position is becoming weaker on a month to month basis, what is quite beneficial for the rest of post-Maidan parties.
Ihor Kolomoisky - Poroshenko’s main adversary - is developing a political project of “UKROP” formed under his personal patronage. The “Right Sector” paramilitary organisation (accused of direct connections with Kolomoisky’s industries) seems to be more and more active on the anti-Poroshenko side. To say more, forces like Timoshenko’s “Batkivshchina” and Sadovyi “Samopomich” also gain certain benefits from Poroshenko’s impotence. Like in a classical conflictology case, weakening of one pole creates opportunity for another – a way to a fundamental change goes through conflict, instability and turbulences.
Belarus and its people used to be very proud of the so called “social stability” prevailing in their country. The popular claim is that there is no threat of neither a revolution nor any aggression from abroad. Living standards remain on the highest level in whole post-Soviet area, but on the other hand… it is still far from those prevailing in European Union countries.
The model of Lukashenko’s economy bases on the state’s direct engagement. This system is highly ineffective and cost-consuming, and easily falls down into inflation, causing an endless debt loophole. To put it together with a political system that seems to be unadaptive and resistant to any change, it creates a situation that one can describe as more a threat of stagnation than blissful stabilization.
During the last presidential election there has been a clear signal sent to the world that any change in Belarus is possible only under Lukashenko’s authority. It has been proven in western countries that democracies used to be more flexible in terms of innovation and adaptation than their undemocratic counterparts. Therefore that – praised by many – “stability” will not last forever in Belarus. Especially, when the public mood will get radical.
The point where those two seemingly different systems meet is the outcome. Walking different paths, both countries were able to achieve mostly the same destination. Average wages in Kyiv and Minsk remain on similar level (around 200 USD per month) and the same goes for increasing prices. Superficial stability is reached by paying very high costs. Economic competitiveness remains on a very low level, no matter if it is because of state governance or maintaining oligarchy. And still, geopolitical positions of Belarus and Ukraine are equally unsure. None of them is free from the threat of Russian aggression.
Recent elections show the most significant features that both post-soviet republics have in common. One of them is definitely worth noticing: the voting process is still used only as a tool of high-level political fight, where interests of people recede into the background.
In Belarus the voting day is mostly described as a celebration or a ritual that allows authorities to build an illusion of legitimacy. In Ukraine it is only one of many ways to regulate a conflict between political or business powers that seems to be unsolvable by other methods.
Konstanty Chodkowski is a journalist for Eastbook.eu and member of the Polish Geopolitical Association.
Mr. Skeltal and his kalcium-clad bois shamble toward the Unkonstruktion fuckbois, intent and eviserating the rest of them.
Miraculously, nothing happens. The sledgebros shrug off the damage and continue sipping their cheap coffee.
"Bah!" Jeered Mr. Skeltal, "Time to make you lazy orange fuckbois dance!" He pressed his dooter against his bony lips and tries to rouse a skeletal band from the grave.
But his efforts fall upon deaf/super dead ears. "You bastards have no taste in music," he mumbles while hiding under his hat.
Zupponn reaches the foot of the building and squints up at the top of the roof as if cacluating a way up.
Feat success! The two pumpkinsmen immediately stop their resistance and sit down, staring expectantly at the Apostles.
He then sets his sights on the peaceass below while slowly drawing a dagger. "I'm either a little drunk, or you're very blurry. Good thing you stick out so much."
Another just barely survives being shot point-blank. This dimmy alone has survived getting shot on two seperate accounts now.
The explosion destorys the ramp, kills the mechanik who had just recently caught on fire, and disrupts the other mechanik.
Meanwhile the PumpKing lands just in front of the generator, dully noting the dust that appears in front of him. "Just how long has this pocket 'verse been suspended in time?" He wonders to himself.
His buddy comes into the cottage and nails the mimic to the wall. "That's the ugliest chest I've ever seen," he grunts.
"Hey you stud-heads, quit screwin' the pooch and give this thing a shove!" Orders UnBuilder Bill. The Sledgebros realize their break was over anyway and casually stroll over to the Studlift.
UnBuilder Bill revs the studlift's 1 horsepower engine as the sledgebros behind give it a good push. "Ramp or not, this wall is goin' down than the time I have to retire!"
The impact creates a large opening in the wall and weakens it even further. It won't be able to take much more after this.
The kultists must clear the dead trees in order to continue and need at least three minifigs to complete the summon, otherwise whatever sort of creatures they rise may not be compliant.
I know this battle's aging toward a year old, but I'm just waiting on orders from Bookwyrm, Scratch, Zupponn, and Motorhead Fan. I'll probably send those chaps a message, but if they don't reply/don't wanna, I might have some openings.
The ranged Skelebois move up and take aim and combine their fire on the studlift. One of them critfails so bad he falls over disrupted.
Mr. Skeltal and his boneherder beast scuttle up toward the UnKonstruction Krew’s frontlines and rises his dooter.
“Ho-ho-ho, he-he-he! Dem UnKonstruction bois are eatin’ beans!” He sings aloud, attempting to demoralize the krew.
Heroic feat failure! The UnKonstruction Krew has taken a lunch break instead and have gained a +1 bonus to all their rolls until the end of this turn.
The Studlift lowers its dekonstructor-arms onto the tower. The tower starts to creak backward, its foundations already comprised.
The tower winds up killing two of Ken’s Scream Team (a bitchin' witch and Funkenstein who probably wishes he hadn't taken the lumber under the tower), the kannon operator, as well as crushing the catapult.
Bill the UnBuilder climbs partway out of his Studlift to shout at the Skelebois, “Hey boneheads, why don’t you make yourselves useful and tear down this wall?!”
The nearest three boneflingers turn around and stare at the fence but have already used their attacks for the turn. “Wait… what were we supposed to do?” Needless to say, the feat doesn’t do much. Feat Success??
Meanwhile one of the nailgunners shoots at the disrupted pumpkinsmen, but his armor deflects the attack.
The ex-studlift operator finally gets up after being disrupted and wonders what in the BrikHell is going on.
I dunno what happened to rest of the pictures for the Kultists, but to sum it up the melee troops moved up to engage the skeleboys after Kath used his SN dice to boost their attacks. One skeleton goes down. The ranged kultists tried to shoot at Mr. Skeltal and his steed, but were just an inch or two out of range.
“Fight on my children, peace will be upon you soon! One way or another.” He chants and manages to grant them a +1 bonus to their attacks for the turn.
The rest continue pouring into the alley. They swing their picket signs madly but their damage is tanked by the Vampire Knight.
But he’s just short of dislodging part of the roof. “Dangit. Wait did that really just make a dong sound effect?”
Another pumpkinsmen fires at the dimmy who had just speared one of his brethren but fails to damage the seemingly impervious protestor.
The PumpKing grasps the keg of Maniac Beer and considers taking a swig, only to realize there wasn’t a tap on it. "Bah, perhaps its better that way."
The PumpKing creates a wall of pumpkin vines to cut anyone else off from the generator. Feat success!
Persistently, the bitchin’ witches continue following Zupponn up the building, one of them magiking up the door.
But the witches weren’t having it. One of them throws her bottle of potion at Zupps, but he easily parries it.
"I've fought countless undead, golden-armored elves, and now you creepy, flowery clowns. What's next?" Ken said as the TruceAss's life force ebbed away.

How to buy Bristlenose Catfish might seem like a strange title for an article. After all you can buy Bristlenose Catfish from nearly anywhere. Aquariums, Live Fish Stores, Pet Shops and of course private breeders.
Therefore if you’re just buying Bristlenose as algae eaters for your Community Tank then in most cases it’s just a matter of buying some from a reputable source, placing them in the tank and that’s it. This certainly was the case for me when I first bought Bristlenose Catfish for my Bettas tanks.
What I discovered later on though, was that if you’re buying Bristlenose to breed then there is a little bit more to it than that as after I bought my first two pairs I discovered that there was another consideration as well that very few take into consideration. In fact I think this consideration is so important I’ll write about it later in this article as in the long run it might just save you a whole lot of wasted time going down a path that comes up fruitless (or maybe fryless?).
First of all though, if you are buying Bristlenose to breed then there are probably two major ways in which you can go about it.
You can buy a group of juveniles, place them in you community tank, give them some favourable conditions, then sit back and wait for them to mature and let nature take it’s course. This of course works for many and how well it does work can be a little bit “hit and miss”. Juvenile Bristlenose are difficult to sex and of course it’s not until they get older that the male grows his bristles and it then becomes obvious. Therefore, this is the reason why many “would be breeders” buy several juvenile Bristlenose, as it increases the likelihood of at least getting one male or female to form a breeding pair amongst the group.
The next method many new Bristlenose breeders use to buy Bristlenose Catfish, is to go out and buy a specific Bristlenose pair or trio. Either method has it’s advantages. Having a trio of one male and two females increases the likelihood of a successful spawn while placing a pair together does ensure you know the genetics of the fry. So I suppose whichever method you decide on can simply come down to personal choice.
Next up is to select your actual breeding pairs and this is where many new breeders make their first mistake. You see sometimes breeders sell a whole spawn at an early age to another party to raise and then onsell again as they come into sexual maturity, when the sexes are just becoming more distinguishable. These Bristlenose can become good breeders as they are young, healthy and virile but here’s where the first mistake in often made by the new breeder.
They buy a pair or trio of these Bristlenose and then try and breed them. This can be a mistake. You see you can breed brothers with sisters from the same spawn and you can do it successfully but what you will find is that “you” as a the buyer won’t know how many generations back these Bristlenose have been interbred. And of course the reason why is because the seller probably won’t know either or in some cases he/she might but because he’s/she’s got an investment that he/she wants to sell, you may find you won’t get the full story anyway. Therefore you won’t have any idea what their linage is.
Therefore diversity of genes with Bristlenose , just like with any species is important. It ensures strong healthy offspring and in this case fry that are stronger, more disease resistant and more likely to survive and grow to adulthood. So if you like you can try breeding Bristlenose from the same spawn and maybe you’ll get away with it but then again maybe you won’t. You may find that your Bristlenose will spawn, produce lots of eggs and fry and then slowly the fry will die and you’ll be left with just a handful.
Then you’ll probably sit back and wonder what went wrong. Was there a problem with the condition of the water? Were the parents inexperienced or is it just a case of second time lucky? Was there interference from some other fish in the tank? You may be just left scratching your head.
Therefore you could then spend a whole lot of time trying to remedy all manner of suspected issues only to then try again and suffer the same result the second time. Then at the end of the day the real cause was simply the fact that you chose to breed a brother and sister that had come from a long line of interbred Bristlenose.
Therefore if you want to save yourself the hassle, the easy way around it is to simply still buy the same amount of pairs you’re after from the same spawn but then go and find another spawn from a totally different source, buy the same amount of Bristlenose the second time and then swap them around. If you want you can then sell the excess Bristlenose pairs/trios you don’t want and advertise them as having diverse genes and hopefully they will be more attractive to a buyer for that very reason.
Then of course the other way is to buy Bristlenose Catfish individually from different sources to ensure their genetic diversity. At the end of the day though, how you go about it is up to you.
So there you have it, if you want to buy Bristlenose Catfish for the purpose of breeding look for diversity of bloodlines and buy from a different source.
NHS workers need a pay rise - Britain Needs A Pay Rise NHS workers need a pay rise - Britain Needs A Pay Rise
NHS staff across the country are spreading the word about why they feel the government’s pay offer is so unfair.
They’ve already had years of pay freezes and caps during the recession, which have seen wages for people working in the health service fall significantly against inflation. This year, the government are rejecting an independently advised pay settlement, and offering 1%, again behind inflation, and this time with so many strings attached that most won’t even get that.
We think NHS workers deserve fair pay, just as millions of others across the UK are missing out on a fair share of the recovery.
If you agree, march with us in London on 18 October, to tell our politicians that Britain Needs A Payrise.
March forms up from 11am on Victoria Embankment, before heading to a rally in Hyde Park. More info on getting there.
Will you be marching with us in London? Sign up and we'll update you with all the latest about the event.
Athur Conan Doyle was the son of Charles Doyle a Civil Servant from Ireland and an alcoholic and Mary Foley. He was one of ten children. His grandfather was John Doyle a famous caricaturist.
At home and then a local school in Edinburgh. Jesuit Preparatory School in Hodder, Lancashire. Stonyhurst, a Jesuit Secondary School nearby. University of Edinburgh. Helped fund his course by working as a surgeon on ships such as the “Hope” which was then bound for the Arctic and the “Mayumba” bound for West Africa where he nearly died of Typhoid).
Whilst studying he worked as a medical assistant to Dr Richardson of Sheffield which only lasted three weeks. He then moved to Shropshire working for Dr Elliot and then to Birmingham where he was treated like a son by Dr Reginald Hoare and his family.
1882: Doyle set up as a Doctor in Plymouth with a fellow student from Edinburgh Dr George Budd but it was unsuccessful and the two did not get on. Doyle then set up in Elm Grove, Southsea near Portsmouth but had very few patients and therefore little money. He subsidised his income writing detective stories. His first story was accepted by Chambers Journal in Edinburgh.
1887: Arthur Conan Doyle published the first of his Sherlock Holmes story “A Study in Scarlet” in Becton’s Christmas Annual and had enough money to give up medicine. Holmes was reputedly based on one of his medical school lecturers Doctor Joseph Bell. His Short Stories about Holmes where published in the “Strand Magazine” from then on. Became a member of the Portsmouth Literary and Scientific Society.

1893: Holmes is killed off in “The Final Problem” and the reading public were horrified. His pregnant wife was weak with tuberculosis and so they went to Egypt to effect a cure. Unfortunately war broke out between the British and the Dervishes but not to be outdone Conan-Doyle become a temporary war correspondent for “The Westminster Gazette” newspaper.
1897: Arthur Conan Doyle meets Jean Leckie and continues a platonic relationship during his wife’s illness.
1899-1902: He served as a doctor in the Boer War with a hospital paid for and organised buy John Langman.
1914: Attended the meeting of writers called by the Liberal politician Charles Masterman who wanted to form a Writer’s Propaganda Bureau at the start of the First World War. Conan-Doyle wrote the pamphlet “To Arms!” as his contribution. He also wrote many articles about the war for the newspaper the “Daily Chronicle”. Although well into his fifties he served as a private throughout the war in the Crowborough Company of the Sixth Royal Sussex regiment.
1916: Doyle became a convinced Spiritualist, a cause to which he would spend the rest of his life often working with his friend Sir Oliver Lodge.
1917: Death of his son Kingsley Conan-Doyle in October who died after being wounded and contracting pneumonia.
1922: Doyle declared the “Cottingley Fairy” fake photographs to be genuine and was ridiculed in the press.

“Qatar has pledged US$15 billion of direct investments in Turkey,” presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin wrote on Twitter.
“Turkish-Qatari relations are based on solid foundations of true friendship and solidarity,” he said.
The announcement came after Qatar's emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani held lunchtime talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Erdogan thanked the emir and the people of Qatar for “standing by Turkey”, the official Anadolu news agency reported.
He said relations with Qatar, which he described as a “friendly and brotherly country”, would be boosted in many areas.
Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, who is Erdogan's son-in-law, and his Qatari counterpart Ali Sharif Al-Emadi were present at the talks in the capital Ankara.
Turkey has been rocked in recent days by a sharp decline in the value of its lira after US President Donald Trump tweeted last Friday that Washington was doubling aluminium and steel tariffs for Ankara.
Washington's move came during an ongoing dispute over Turkey's holding of an American pastor for two years.
In response, Erdogan has called for a boycott of US electrical goods while Ankara has sharply hiked tariffs on some US goods.
The turmoil has raised fears of a looming economic crisis in Turkey and prompted alarm that foreign investors in the country, including Qatar, could be hit in the fallout.
Turkey and Qatar — which are also a very close US ally — have become close economic and political partners in recent times.
Doha has US$20 billion worth of investments in Turkey, official figures showed last month, and Ankara is now one of the top exporters to the emirate.
In recent days, Qatari supporters of Turkey have begun a public campaign in Doha to change their riyals into lira in an attempt to shore up the plunging Turkish currency.
Underscoring the ties between the countries, Sheikh Tamim was the first foreign leader to phone President Erdogan during the failed coup in Turkey in 2016.
Ankara has been conspicuous in its support of Doha as Qatar battles with continued Saudi-led isolation from Arab neighbours. Turkey also maintains a small military base in Qatar.

A decorating dream in the White House: SD native spends three days as volunteer decorator sty White House
The large spacious gardens at the James River Correctional Center are maintained by just a few inmates. The fresh vegetables are primarily donated to the Community Action Food Pantry. John M. Steiner / The Sun2 / 5
Wednesday is usually harvest day at the JRCC for the various produce picked by the residents who maintain the gardens. John M. Steiner / The Sun3 / 5

Eight inmate gardeners at James River Correctional Center said the long hours come easier knowing the hard work is helping people in need.
The small incentives are a big reward, said Derek Emineth, a JRCC inmate gardener. “We are a good group of guys who work well together and it’s just nice giving back.”
The garden has doubled in space and output since it started with 3,200 square feet in 2016 to 8,390 square feet this year, said Arlie Lind, a correctional officer and garden supervisor. The garden produced 3,911 pounds of vegetables in 2016 and an abundance of periodic rain this year could help them surpass 8,000 pounds, he said.
The produce of beets, cabbage, carrots, garlic, green beans, green peppers, onions, potatoes, pumpkins, sweet peas, tomatoes, squash and zucchini is delivered weekly to the Community Action Region VI Food Pantry, Lind said.
“This is huge,” said Sarah Oberlander, coordinator of the Community Action food pantry. “We don't get any fresh produce besides what people bring in to us.”
The clientele love the fresh produce and are already asking about the squash, but that’s a fall vegetable and will come in later, she said. The pantry is grateful to Lind and the inmates, she said.
Vegetables are difficult to afford on a limited budget, said Maureen Wegenke, executive director of the senior center.
"We have a table set up at the center where seniors and others can pick up this produce,” Wegenke said “What a blessing for them.”
The purpose of the program is to teach new skills that the inmates can take with them when they leave, Lind said. The gardeners, some with and some without experience, are proud of their work and to know the result is helping people in need, he said.
“I’m so proud of those guys,” Lind said. “They do such a nice job and truly enjoy working out there.”
The response from retailers has been to donate seeds to the prison garden program as a way to support the food pantries, Lind said. Country Gardens Floral & Greenhouse Inc. donates potato seedlings and Home of Economy donates other seeds, he said.
“With the support of local merchants we have zero dollars expended in the garden,” Lind said. “Everything is donated.”
The pumpkins are used for a pumpkin painting event with children and fathers, said JRCC Warden Chad Pringle. The kids can take the pumpkin home with them, he said.
The gardeners also built a sensory garden in the recreation yard and maintain floral gardens around the facility, Pringle said. The construction class built raised flower planters for inmate walking areas to contrast the concrete and fence surroundings, he said.
“Just being able to walk by the flowers definitely has a calming impact and we have got a lot of positive comments from people who said they definitely appreciate it,” Pringle said.
The construction class built 12 adirondack chairs for the sensory garden and recreation yard, where inmates can sit among sunflowers and other plants that attract butterflies and hummingbirds, he said. A koi pond is in the works along with a tree nursery, he said.
“We are lucky that Arlie is willing to share his skills and gifts with these guys,” Pringle said. “He is a unique resource.”
Robert Venker, inmate gardener, said the work is like therapy and he enjoys watching the results with the fast-growing vegetables.
Lind said he understands the therapeutic effect of a garden. He said his home garden is a “refuge from when life turns its back on you.” It goes the same that the prison garden is an outlet for the inmates, he said.
“It has changed these guys that are involved in the program for the better,” Lind said. “We give them an opportunity to make a positive change in their life and the majority of the time they will pick that up and take that with them.”

Hello Jamestown friends, I am writing in support of the Jamestown Public Schools referendum. I am a concerned parent of children who have been in the JPS system for nine years, and I feel this small increase in our property taxes, only about $13 a month on the average $100,000 home, is well worth the impact it will have on this community’s children (this is far less than most of us spend on fast food in a month).
These are important updates that need to happen in our schools. In a 2014 facilities assessment, all elementary schools and the middle school scored poorly on air quality. They need their 1950s boilers, roofing and windows replaced and HVAC systems updated. I would hate to see an outdated boiler give out during the coldest days of winter, requiring the school to shut down, parents scrambling for child care and JPS trying to find funding to get the school reopened in haste. These maintenance needs are the largest and most important piece to the referendum.
The second-largest piece is to close Washington and create an addition to Louis L’Amour. This decision was based on more than five years of thought and consultation. Robert Lech and his team have spent many years working with many different committees before reaching this conclusion that the best possible path for our school system is to close Washington. Anyone interested in the process can read about it in the Board Memo on the Referendum 2018 page of the JPS website. Lech, the entire school board and the Citizen’s Advisory Committee understand the emotional attachment to Washington school and Ernie Gates Football Field. I am certain this decision was not taken lightly and if there was a better solution they would have found it over the last several of years of study. And even better, that they have an interested buyer that can repurpose Washington school into affordable housing.
With respect to the football field, if JPS sells the Washington school building they cannot keep the football field in that location. The high school campus is the best and safest place to have that field, not at an elementary school. And the bonus part of having the football field at JHS is that they would be able to make it a multi-function athletic complex to benefit not just the football team, but also track and field, marching band, PE classes and others. To put it into perspective, this multi-functional athletic complex would not be the largest piece of this referendum funding. It’s important to remember that the largest quantity of this money will go directly toward fixing, repairing and maintaining the buildings that house our children’s education!

Of course we all faced the problem of the down time of electricity in Egypt and of course our electrical appliances suffered too,and we heard about saving energy and searching about new energy sources because as our population in Egypt increases we really need to search about another sources of energy.
And as I am a member of Flair Systems Home automation team I thought a lot that home automation systems can really be a part of the solution of this problem.
Home automation systems are saving energy systems because you can control lighting and electrical appliance in many ways and from anywhere to decrease energy consumption.
And let me start with a very simple and easy to install and use system, a very simple system to control our outdoor lighting.
You may live in a building of 5 or 6 floors and you are living in the 5th floor and may be no one is living in the 1st or 2nd floor and everyday you have to go down to turn on the outdoor lighting of the building and lighting in the garden around your building or your garage lighting. And then, you have to turn it off again early in the morning.
Due to some reasons you may not be able to wake up early after sunrise to turn off outdoor lighting so the light may stay ON for 4 or 5 hours and may be more till you go down and turn it off while you don’t need it.
May be you aren’t able to go down to turn ON the light after sunset and if visitor came or if your son or daughter came from the club, friend or from work or anywhere they will find the building dark. Or you may turn on the light very early before sunset after you come from work because you don’t want to go downstairs again to turn it on.
Imagine if every home, every building, every villa and every compound do that, there will be a lot of wasted energy and this will increase the problem beside the frequent increase in population.
Our system use sensors to sense the sun light and automatically turn on outdoor lighting after sunset and turn it off again after sunrise. It will decrease the consumption of electricity and of course save energy.
Another system for floor lighting instead of turning on a lamp in each floor or instead of using a timer which turns on all lights in all floors with press and turn it off automatically after a time.
The motion sensing night light system use sensors to turn on the light of each floor at night automatically as it sense a motion in this floor and only one floor will be lighted at a time because after you reached the next floor the sensor in it will sense your motion and turn on the light in this floor while the previous floor lighting will turned off automatically after 60 seconds or any programmed period of time.
Motion-Sensor can be mounted outside or inside. Perfect for lighting stairs, hallways or to act as a night light for children.
Two simple systems of many other Home automation systems will make a big difference if used widely. And the price is very cheap, everyone can have it in his home.

In September 2001, Barrick Properties Inc. and its general counsel at the time, Stephen A. Crystal, came together to form Barrick Corporation for the purpose of purchasing hotels and casinos. Crystal and Barrick had enjoyed several years as a working team, with Crystal being the general counsel to the Barrick family.
Barrick and Crystal extended past their existing working relationship to become partners in Barrick Corporation and begin the purchase of six hotel/casinos in downtown Las Vegas, Nevada. The purchase was the first of its kind, insofar as buying so many properties and converting the ownership within a 12-hour period after approval from the Nevada Gaming Control Board.
Through its subsidiaries, the company bought out the legendary and long-time gamer Jackie Gaughan. With the exception of one hotel, the sale included all of the hotels, motels, casinos and approximately 37 acres of land owned by Gaughan in the downtown Las Vegas Township. The deal took eight months to negotiate and included 1,904 employees along with 1,850 hotel rooms. The option to buy Mr. Gaughan’s remaining property, The El Cortez, was also included in the purchase.
Barrick sold its interest in downtown in December 2005. Shortly thereafter, Barrick purchased Crystal's interest in Barrick Corporation, as well.
Today Barrick Corporation, through its ownership in different companies, is involved in the acquisition of additional gaming properties in several states and countries.
“Some exciting things are just around the corner for Barrick Corporation in the gaming world,” said CEO D.W. Barrick at a recent Las Vegas meeting and gathering of gaming owners. “Just stay tuned.”

The Madawaska Valley Horticultural Society held its first general meeting more than 26 years ago in Combermere. It has been a member of the Ontario Horticultural Association since 1990. Since then the Madawaska Valley Horticultural Society has grown to more than 140 members, many of whom actively volunteer at society events and on projects throughout this community. The society hosts a number of public events throughout the year including the spring Plant and Compost Sale, the Horticultural Society Strawberry Social, the annual Garden Tour, and the fall Flower and Vegetable Show. They also raise an annual donation for the Madawaska Valley Food Bank and provide a bursary for students at Madawaska Valley District High School.
What made the Madawaska Valley Horticultural Society stand out from other deserving volunteer organizations in 2016 was the dedication shown by those engaged in the society’s Adopt-A-Bed projects and their support for Communities in Bloom. Horticultural society volunteers spent many long hours planning, preparing, planting and maintaining community gardens throughout Madawaska Valley last year. A few of these projects included the tulip garden at the Barry’s Bay Legion, the landscaping in front of the Post Office and the Public Library, the log planters in Barry’s Bay, the flowers on the Combermere bridge, and the flower planters in Kamaniskeg Roadside Park. It was a lot of digging, weeding and watering. These volunteer hours spent beautifying our community represent a significant monetary value to the municipality. But, what is most appreciated by our residents, businesses and visitors is the valuable message they send that this is a strong, caring, and engaged community; someplace to stop and visit, somewhere you’d want to live.
This evening it is an honour and a privilege to present the 2016 Mayor’s Appreciation Award to the dedicated volunteers of the Madawaska Valley Horticultural Society whose contributions to our community bring green space to life and make this a beautiful place for everyone.
With us this evening is Sharon Mahussier, the 2016 President of the Madawaska Valley Horticultural Society (and Peter Dolan who has taken over as President in 2017). I’d like to ask Sharon (and Peter) and the society members that are here to join me at the front as I present the 2016 Mayor’s Appreciation Award to the Madawaska Valley Horticultural Society.

Ali ABUNIMAH: "Why BDS is replacing Iran as Israel’s biggest “existential threat”" (The Electronic Intifada, June 2, 2015).
Judy MALZ: "Israeli academics report signs of undeclared boycott targeting them. Fewer invitations, more articles rejected by leading journals, foot-dragging on recommendations - and university leaders fear it may get worse."(Haaretz, June 2, 2015).
Robert FISK: "Canada's plan to make boycotting Israel a 'hate crime' is stupid and counterproductive. The law change would put Jews and civil society groups on trial for anti-Semitism"(The Independent, May 17, 2015).
"In the end, of course, it’s quite simple. Boycotting a state for its crimes is a non-violent but potentially powerful way to express moral outrage at a time when political statements – or cowardly governments like that of Stephen Harper – fail to represent the anger of voters or have any effect on a state that ignores international law."
"Israeli President Reuven Rivlin held an “emergency” meeting Thursday with the heads of Israel’s universities and colleges to discuss the academic boycott, which he described as a “strategic threat.”"
Despite its bad press, teamwork and its cousin, collaboration, are pervasive buzzwords in the corporate world.
Teamwork is great to disseminate responsibility in such a way that nobody can individually be thrown under the bus in case something goes wrong.
Throughout my long and winding career in the marketing, advertising and editorial rackets I’ve partaken of hundreds of attempts at teamwork that were anything but.
Most of these attempts began by blatantly breaking the #1 rule of brainstorming: the notion that no idea is a bad idea, that no idea should be frowned upon.
It basically consists of a bunch of eager-to-please individuals who, for the sake of not rocking the boat, pretend to agree on something they all secretly disagree with.
Good-intentioned folks “picking their battles” and acting against their will simply because they don’t think it is an a opportune political maneuver to raise their voice.
The Bible, for instance, arguably the most important work of literary fiction ever written, is a massive oeuvre of teamwork.
Dozens, if not hundreds of scribes and scholars making their selfless contributions throughout generations to shape the myths and morality of Judeo-Christian civilization.
Yeah, it is a gigantic compilation of make-believe yet it still is, at least until the advent of the internet and wikipedia, the most ambitious treatise of ethics, literature, fact and fiction known to man.

No body could deny that writing is one of the basic abilities for men. Put it another way, it is unlikely to imagine human civilization without writing ability.
At the top of the list, if we overlook the significance of writing ability, we will suffer a great difficulty in our daily written communication. In addition to what has been mentioned above, it is advisable for us to attach importance to this ability because writing plays a key in our academic performance. To summarize,writing does carry a positive implication for our life and study.
In view of the great value of writing ability, we should take actions to develop this capability. For my part, initially, we are supposed to keep in mind that reading is the first step of writing, so we should read great books as many as possible, learning from the great works how to write concisely and effectively. Moreover, owing to the fact that practice makes perfect, we should frequently practice writing; for example, we may develop the habit of keeping a diary.

Someone has put the presentation I did to the Auckland Linux User Group on the RepRap up as a stream off archive.org:
I put it on archive.org because the Auckland LUG site was abysmally slow, they needed a break anyway. :)
BTW, to view the video you'll need to get the Ogg Theora codec, or just grab VLC at www.videolan.org. But I expect anyone who reads this site knows this stuff.
Encouraged by the great performance of Ed's Z axis, I've fired up an experiment he's been asking for. I've done an extrusion on 240 grit sandpaper (some ask about the scale; the hexagon is 16mm (0.63") in diameter):
Note the relatively well-formed sides, extruded as 0.5mm thick layers. Between each layer, the fan was manually run while the outline was being printed. This seemed to cool things off enough, though there's no ducting to protect the heater yet. As expected, the polymer stuck to the sandpaper like, well, glue sticking to sandpaper really. Of course, the sandpaper is stuck to the glass sheet with glue to keep it flat. The Tower Of Ooze (right) came off OK, but the hexagon was stuck solid. So I end up trying to pull things off a sheet of thin, cheap glass and you know what'll happen if I persist in doing that... Fortunately the paper tore before the glass broke.
I'll do one or two more experiments with the sandpaper - might as well use it while it's stuck there - before washing the glue/sandpaper off and trying a different size grit.
Very nice, layers are much more clearly defined! How about glueing it to that big ol' aluminium plate, it won't crack under removal stress. :)
I'm surprised that even at 240 grit, adhesion is still that strong. Maybe finer grit sandpaper, 600 or so, like the stuff used for sanding metal would still be sufficient.
If so, stuff like polystyrene foam as Plaasjapie suggested (sanded a bit to open it up?) and roughed wood would be comparable, and interesting to test.
Having difficulty getting a sense of scale. How tall is the object? It looks like there are 10ish layers, so I'm guessing 5mm.
Have you considered DIY "sandpaper" made with say- spray glue and granulated sugar? then a little water would release your print, removing the paper could be done later by whatever means apply.
Getting relatively thin but perfectly flat sheets of wood is proving harder than originally anticipated.
I had been thinking suggesting plywood, but more along the lines of 3/4 inch. Small squares (like at 20 x 20cm) that thick are extremely stable and flat, especially in the smoother finish grades.
In better quality grades (more ply layers) flatness and stability is very good all the way down to 1/2, sometimes even 3/8 inch, as long as one steers clear of the general purpose rough plywood. Good lumber yards have both low and high grade plywoods.
Now seeing you mention needing thin...how thin do you need? To fit under the extruder I'm guessing...? Hobbyshops sometimes have very good grade softwood plywood for model airplanes and boats, in all sorts of flavors under 5mm (1/4") thick.
That helps put things in perspective. So, what we're looking at is an extreme closeup of something about the size of a pencil eraser. Those small imperfections are almost invisible at that size.
Yesterday I saw a paper cutting cnc machine using basically contact cement for that (felt just like the back of sticky notes). 3M has a good product: F77 contact cement. The paper cutter was using a flexible plastic backer (with contact cement to hold the paper) and translating that under the head. Probably .030 inch thick plastic (maybe nylon) with a fine texture.
How about a block of Oasis instead of sandpaper (it's that stiff foam that florists use to put flower stalks in). That would be rigid, would have a rough surface to which the Capa would stick, and would be easy to separate things from.
I looked at oasis foam last weekend, and the quality seems dubious. It'll certainly need to be shaped before use. I'll give it a go a some point, but it'll have to take its place in the queue.
How about if the construction surface just had a few blocks that could be clamped down (say magnetically) with their edges flush with the bottom layer of the extruded product to hold it in place?

Looking through historical records for the parish of Barwick in Elmet brings up numerous mentions of the name Vevers. The main sources I've referred to are ' History of Barwick in Elmet' by Rev. Colman, published in 1908, the parish registers transcribed and published by Lumb, 'Records of the Parish of Whitkirk', by Platt and Morkill dated 1892, and more recently 'Scholes is our Village' by Shirley Talaga dated 1985.
Colman provides several pages of information on the Vevers families and considers the name to be a variation of Evers. This ties in well with a coat of arms on a memorial to William Vevers of Scholes who died in 1744, to be seen on the north wall of the parish church. The arms can be traced back to the Eure, Evers or Evre family, who came from Evre, nowadays known as Iver, in Buckinghamshire in the 14th century.
Just when the first Vevers came to live in Barwick isn't known. The spelling and pronunciation of surnames has tended to be rather flexible over the centuries, but in the mid 15th and early 16th centuries two vicars of Leeds were from the Evers family, and the nephew of the later one became a lord in 1544. It is recorded that he used Vevers as one of the alternative spellings of his surname. Although he would not have been the source of the Barwick Vevers (the title would have passed to them rather than going extinct), it probably came from a close member of that family.
Numerous Vevers are to be found locally and only in the Leeds area - Methley, Swillington, Kippax, Rothwell - from the 1540s onwards. The first record I've found for Barwick is John Vevers who is listed on the jury 1548-9, and a copyholder in the manor of Scholes. In the manor of Barwick in the same year was Joan Vyvers, a widow.
Compulsory parish records of baptisms, marriages and burials, the most plentiful genealogical source, however only commenced in 1538, so earlier details are sparse, and there is rather a significant gap in the register between 1600-1630.
The early Vevers families were yeoman farmers, tenants of the lord of the manor, and in the 1700s there appear to have been three main branches to the family. William, whose memorial and coat of arms is in the church, lived at Scholes Hall. William described himself as a gentleman, and had extensive land holdings in the area.
Stephen, a cousin, also a gentleman, owned Morwick Hall. Stephen was a keen horseman, and bred Morwick Belle which he raced at York, alongside such as the legendary Gimcrack.
Richard was a cousin who ran a tannery business at Potterton. At this time, the Leeds area was a major centre for production of leather. Although well off, Richard did not have the same status as his cousins at that time. There are some interesting letters from Rev. George Plaxton about Richard, who was clearly behaving in his view, as someone a cut above his station. In one he is complaining that Richard has refused to serve as a church warden, which was expected of lesser citizens when called upon.
In 1732 Richard sold his business to Robert Fretwell and died two years later. There was no will, but a grant of administration was given to his chief creditor, James Oates, his brother-in-law. His son Richard soon after moved to Hereford, where he seems to have made good, becoming a gentleman, and achieving some success at horse racing. Another son, William, became a clergyman in Wakefield. Robert Fretwell seems to have rebuilt much of Potterton Hall. He had extensive business interests in the leather trade and also ran haulage carts and barges travelling between Tadcaster and Hull, but eventually got into financial difficulties and sold out, and left for India (see 'The Barwicker' No.37).
When William of Scholes Hall died, his son Richard was only 14 years old. An allowance of œ60 per year went to William's wife Priscilla, but the main estate went in trust to Richard with the proviso that it would pass to Priscilla's nephew if Richard died without an heir of his body. Priscilla remarried to John Atkinson but it was not to be a happy union.
Richard never married and died in 1767, at 36 years old, not an unusual life span for those days. With no family heir, he left most of his estate to 10 year old Richard Wilkinson of Rothwell, who took the surname Vevers as directed by the will. As yet I haven't found out why young Richard was so favoured, or why the estate didn't automatically end up in the hands of Richard's mother's family, the Brookes. There were several Vevers living in Rothwell at the time, but I haven't found a family connection with the Scholes Vevers.
Young Richard doesn't appear to have lived in the Barwick area, but took up residence at his benefactor's house in Bishopthorpe, York, and the Scholes estate was subsequently sold to the Gray family. The new Mr Vevers entered Cambridge University, qualifying as a clergyman, and subsequently spent most of his days as rector or curate of a number of parishes (sometimes simultaneously) in Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire. He seems to have reached a well respected position in society and his daughter married Lord Chief Justice Denman.
Scholes Hall is believed to have been originally built on the site of the old Scholes Manor House. The Hall no longer exists, but was where the old people's bungalows now stand, in front of the modern Manor House community centre. The original buttressed wall in the picture has recently been demolished and replaced by a wooden fence.
The will of Richard is a lengthy document. One point it labours is that Richard's mother is to continue to get her allowance, but as she is separated from her second husband, the will is drafted to prevent him getting his hands on any of the money. Divorce was out of the question for most people in those days, and women usually to had to forego any personal property rights once married. Some of Richard's land goes to his cousin John, son of Stephen of Morwick, and there is also a bequest of £50 to pay for a handsome dial or face plate for the church clock, any surplus to go to the poor of the parish.
There is a pedigree of the Vevers family of Scholes in 'Records of the Parish of Whitkirk'. The Vevers family of this time was not obviously connected with Whitkirk, but I've found a number of similar books of the period which were financed by local subscribers, in exchange for a mention in the publication. One subscriber was Henry Vevers from Hereford, a descendant of Richard of Potterton, and the information on Henry's descent is quite detailed, whereas that of the Scholes and Morwick families is less so, and in places conflicts with information from other sources.
Steven Vevers lived in Morwick Hall, but this also was sold to Edward Gray. His widow and sons John and Stephen moved into Scholes Park Farm, which survives, though the Morwick Hall seen today was rebuilt by the Gray family. Much of Potterton Hall was also rebuilt to designs by Robert Carr in about 1740. Robert Carr was also the designer of Harewood House.
Another William Vevers also lived at Kiddal Hall, which was the property of William Rooke of Dronfield and Dodworth. William Vevers married Ann Rooke, though I don't yet know whether he inherited the property. I have found a number of members which I cannot connect to any branch as yet, especially since there was a fair bit of movement around local villages like Aberford, Bardsey and Thorner, but by the mid 19th century any remaining in the parish appear to have died or moved away.
The final survivor in the Parish seems to have been John Vevers, a carpenter who died in 1841. He had spent his working life in Quarry Hill, Leeds. By this time other branches were well established in Leeds and York, and a much more numerous Vevers branch was residing in the border towns of Lancashire.

What do long extinct pig-footed bandicoots, anatomical education and 3D printing have in common? Justin Adams and Paul McMenamin of the Centre for Human Anatomy Education at the Monash Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology are using imaging data generated by the Monash NIF node fellows and the radiography team at Monash Biomedical Imaging. Their work developing highly detailed tissue models of human anatomy and long extinct Australian fauna is bring the dead back to life.
Neurosurgical training using simulators is now becoming more commonplace. High resolution CT and MRI data of cadaver hands, and biomechanical data available on the different tissues of the hand are being utilized to maximize anatomical and biomechanical accuracy in the development of a hand surgery simulator. These types of 3D datasets and rendering methods are being used to help develop the next generation of surgical assist robots by developing methods for generating precise tissue maps from clinical imaging data. Justin, Paul and his team including PhD student Raf Ratinam use the small bore Inveon CT and extended structural scans on the Skyra 3T MRI to generate high resolution images of iodine preserved human tissue specimens.
The CT and MR images are then reconstructed and “stitched” together to generate the tissue maps, enable further segmentation, 3D rendering and visualisation highlighting to allow students to visualise the tissue morphology during surgical training and anatomy classes. The datasets are then 3D printed using multiple materials to mimic tissue densities and generate highly realistic physical models of hand anatomy for surgical practice and training.
The researchers have also used the techniques with patient clinical CT scans to 3D print fractured bones to produce 3D models that allow surgeons to visualise the fracture and locate fastening points that speeds up the actual surgery. Patients could even collect a souvenir of their bone fracture or break, which would make an interesting trophy in the pool room cupboard at home!

He met her at a party. She was so outstanding, Her hair blonde in color but with a touch of browns in it, her color was not like snow white but was a little brownish white yet she was looking like an angel, wearing a black skirt with a pink top with bangles in her hands and Kajal in her eyes without makeup but yet so beautiful. Many guys chasing after her, while he was so normal and casual, nobody paid attention to him.
At the end of the party, he from all the guys over there invited her to have coffee with him, she was ashtonished and surprised by this offer but due to being polite, she promised. They sat in a nice coffee shop, it was rainning outside and was a die for amosphere around so calm and just the sound of rain falling. He was too nervous to say anything as the divine beauty of her was mesmerizing his words and giving him feelings like he never felt before, he had so much to say, so much to express yet had no words thus he sat silent, she felt uncomfortable, and she thought to herself, “Please, say something or let me go home…”
Suddenly out of no where he asked the waiter, “Would you please give me some salt? I’d like to put it in my coffee.” Everybody stared at him, so strange! His face turned red and he started to sweat but still, he put the salt in his coffee and drank it. She got confused and asked him curiously, “Salt in a coffee ? Is this your hobby or are you diabetic or something” He replied, “When I was a little boy, I lived near the sea, I liked playing in the sea, I could feel the taste of the sea, just like the taste of the salty coffee. Now every time I have the salty coffee, I always think of my childhood, think of my hometown, think of all the things i used to have, my friends, my family, my life it makes me remind all of them and many more, I miss my hometown so much, I miss my parents who are still living there. I really do miss everything which i left behind especially the place which i still call my Home.” While saying that tears filled his eyes. She was deeply touched. That’s his true feeling, from the bottom of his heart. A man who can tell out his homesickness, he must be a man who loves home, cares about home, has responsibility of home, a man worth acknowldging… Then she also started to speak, spoke about her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family, her life...
That was a really nice talk, also a beautiful beginning of their story. They continued to date. She found that actually he was a man who met all her demands; he had tolerance, was kind hearted, warm, caring, knew how to respect the things which he cared for, and even he was extremely romantic, and had a glow in his eyes which always made her think about him even when he wasn't there. She fell in love with him and so did he and then the story was just like every beautiful love story, the princess married to the prince, and then they were living the happy life… And, every time she made coffee for him, she put some salt in the coffee, as she knew that’s the way he liked it.
After 40 years of being happily married, he passed away, left her a letter which said, “My dearest wife, please forgive me, forgive me if i ever hurt you, forgive me for all the lies i told you but the fact is this that the only lie I said to you was—the salty coffee. Remember the first time we dated? I asked you for a coffe because i fell in love with you on the first sight of your beauty, first sight of your eyes made me go wild, I wanted to hold you hand,I wanted you to love me for all your life,I wanted to be your one and only,I wanted to paint you face in the sky, I wanted you in my life,I wanted to be with you all my days and all my nights, I wanted to live with you forever, I only wanted to be with you, I wanted love, I wanted to share it only with you, but how could I, I was a normal guy i had nothing in me which would amaze a beautiful and sensible girl like you, i was so nervous, actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt. It was hard for me to change as you looked in my eyes, so I just went ahead. I never thought that could be the start of our communication! I tried to tell you the truth many times in my life, you know what whenever i tried to tell you the truth while looking into your eyes everything gets too complicated for me, have you ever gone from a dark room into the a bright room. You cannot open your eyes because of the pain from the bright light. That is what it is like for me to look into your eyes. The radiance and light given of by your soul is overpowering. I had lived in darkness for to long and I am not use to the light. Your light shined 100 times brighter than any other person I had ever met. So I shuddered at the prospect of looking into your soul. I might get lost and never come back. That is the final frontier of man, To glimpse into the soul of your lover and to tell her something which meant alot to her so I was too afraid to tell you the truth, as I have promised not to lie to you for anything… Now I’m dying, I am afraid of nothing as am always loosing you but even after my death your love will always remain in my heart and would englighten my soul, so before dying I tell you the truth, I don’t like the salty coffee, what a strange bad taste… But I have had the salty coffee for my whole life! Since I knew you, I never feel sorry for anything I do for you. Having you with me is my biggest happiness for my whole life.You erase my fears, angel, And made me think that I could have the world If I want to, Even if that positivity lasted for a moment, You granted the impossible in my life. What more could I ask for? If I can live for the second time, i still want to know you and have you for my whole life, even though I have to drink the salty coffee again.”
Her tears made the letter totally wet. Someday, someone asked her, “What’s the taste of salty coffee?” She replied, “It’s sweet.”

Aww, thats so sweet. Ditto HFm with the lying, its a bit like their whole relationship was began on a lie, coz thats when she started to like him.
*I wanted to hold you hand,I wanted you to love me for all your life,I wanted to be your one and only,I wanted to paint you face in the sky, I wanted you in my life,I wanted to be with you all my days and all my nights, I wanted to live with you forever, I only wanted to be with you, I wanted love, I wanted to share it only with you, but how could I

On our way back, the sun was coming down and we've seen this tractor which really looks like he has a face (like in Disney's "Cars" movie). And it looks like he was going to sleep in the vineyard.
Great shot, it really does look like the tractor is going to bed. I like how you captured the sunset.

Striped polecats are found throughout the African continent. They are distributed in all habitats occurring between the Mauritanian coast and the coast of Sudan, and southward to the South African coast. (Ansell, 1960; Bere, 1962; Happold, 1987; Smithers, 1986)
Striped polecats inhabit a wide variety of habitats. Although they are most commonly found in African savannas and semi-arid environments, they can also be found anywhere from the coastal sand dunes of the Namib desert, to the big rainfall areas of the District of Zimbabwe, which has forests, high mountains, and even swamps. (Ansell, 1960; Bere, 1962; Happold, 1987; Smithers, 1986)
Striped polecats closely resemble the North American skunk. These small carnivores have glossy, coarse black fur with distinctive white spots on the face. There is a spot on the forehead and one on each cheek, and the black ears have white tips. Four broad white stripes extend down the body from the top of the head to the tip of the tail.
The body length can vary between 28 and 30 cm, not including the tail, which can add an extra 20 to 30 cm to the total length. Males are usually larger than females, weighing in at about 1.4 kg with females down at about 1.02 kg.
These polecats have long sharp claws on the forepaws, which are mainly adapted for digging, but are also useful when climbing trees. The teeth are shorter than the teeth of weasels (another close relative of the polecat), and the cutting edges of the sheering teeth are less developed. (Kingdom, 1977; Meester, 1971)
The mating system of this species is unknown. These animals are solitary in the wild. Male encounters are always aggressive. Males and females only tolerate one another only during the mating season.
Because males are larger than females and are aggressive toward one another, it is likely that there is some competition between them for mates. Species in which males are larger than females generally display some level of polygyny.
Zorillas are generally intollerant of one another except during the mating season, when males and females can interact without aggression. Studies of captive animals indicate that the breeding season is from early spring to late summer. All litters were born between September and December. Females generally produced only one litter in a season, but if all of her babies died young, a female could produce another litter before the end of the breeding season. (Nowak, 1999)
The mother usually gives birth to a litter ranging from 1 to 4 young. The young are born in burrows during the mid-summer months after a 6 week gestation period.Weighing in at 15 g, a newborn is blind and hairless with pink skin. Short fur begins to cover their body at 21 days after birth. The canine teeth don't grow out until day 32, and they don't open their eyes until they are between 35 and 42 days old. Although zorillas can kill their own prey at 9 weeks of age, they aren't completely weaned until they are 18 weeks old. Sexual maturity is reached between the 20th and 30th week, although some females in captivity have given birth at an age of 10 weeks. (Kingdom, 1977; Meester, 1971)
Parental care in this species has not been described in the literature. However, because of the solitary nature of the species, it is reasonable to assume that the male is not involved in rearing the young. Females give birth to their young in burrows. Young are altricial, and therefore require extensive care until they are able to survive on their own. Females nurse young until they are about 18 weeks old. (Nowak, 1999)
The lifespan of wild zorillas has not been reported. However, one captive specimen reportedly lived for 13 years and 4 months. (Nowak, 1999)
Zorillas are almost strictly nocturnal, but some have been seen foraging around dusk and dawn. They seem to lead fairly nomadic lives. These mustelids are solitary creatures that sleep in hollow trees and rock crevices. They may also dig burrows or cover themselves with twigs and leaves when other suitable sleeping places are not present.
Although polecats are efficient swimmers and climbers, they prefer the terrestrial life. When foraging, a zorilla will walk or run with its backs held in a firm arch and its tail in the vertical position with the tip bent down. This loping gate is something like that of a mongoose.
Very little is known about the social life of wild zorillas, and they appear to be mainly solitary. In captivity, but several families have been kept together and grooming appears to be common among them. Some will roll over and present their dark undersides for grooming. Even though large numbers are seldom encountered together in the wild, their captive behavior suggests that they may not be highly territorial. (Kingdom ,1977; Meester, 1971)
Striped polecats are carnivores. They eat a wide variety of small rodents, including rats, mice, and spring hares. They also eat frogs, lizards, snakes, birds, bird eggs, and beetles. They avoid eating vegetable matter.
Polecats are particularly prevalent on rangelands, where the grazing behavior of wild herbivores and domestic livestock tends to keep the grass short. This allows striped polecats to feed on beetles, their larvae, and mice. Where there is an abundance of dung and fodder for beetles and mice to eat, striped polecats flourish because of the abundance of prey (Delany, 1979; Kingdom, 1977)
Specific reports of predation on this species are absent in the literature. However, striped polecats are reportedly pestered by domestic dogs. They may also occasionally be considered as prey items by larger African carnivores.
Striped polecats have a variety of behaviors and physical features which may be evolutionary responses to predation. A polecat will make frequent stops or reversals in direction while moving about. These changes in direction are instantaneous. This might give the impression that they posses quick reflexes, and may deter predators. It is likely that such changes in direction will also avert attack from any predator, especially avian predators, which may be closing in on the polecat.
When bothered by another animal, most commonly dogs, a striped polecat will growl and bark and fluff up its tail. If this does not drive the attacker away, the growling rises to a high pitched scream. The polecat will turn around and present its attacker with a squirt from its well-developed anal glands. (Like the skunks found in North America, striped polecats can spray a large amount of powerfully odorous secretions from their anal glands.) If the odor does not deter the assailant, a polecat may feign death. Anal gland secretions, which linger on the fur of a polecat, may then serve to further deter predators because they have a terrible taste. A predator that tries to bite a polecat may decide that the polecat will make a terrible-tasting meal and subsequently release it.
These beasts commonly feign death when actually attacked. It is dificult to speculate on how that may aid them in detering a predator, as it would seem to make them easier to consume. However, this may allow the predator to get a good taste of their anal gland secretions and allow them the convenience to decide to release the zorilla uneaten.
This predator controls populations of small rodents, especially in agricultural areas, where rodents feed on crops and dung of farm animals.
Striped polecats are very common on big sheep farms and ranches of the Kenyan highlands. They perform an extremely important role in the pastures by keeping down the number of beetle larvae that feed on roots and grasses. Farmers like polecats because they also eat a large proportion of the field rats and mice which ruin crops. (Kingdom, 1977; Meester, 1971)
Striped polecats may be kept as pets if the anal glands are removed to keep down objectionable odors. Interestingly, there is at least one report of native peoples using the anal gland secretions of these animals as a perfume (Kingdom, 1977). (One must wonder whether this was because the people liked the way the polecats smelled, or if wearing polecat scent might be a way to cloak their own human odors from other animals, preventing those animals from detecting human presence — a useful hunting strategy.)
Although striped polecats are not endangered or threatened, the majority of the ones killed are by motor vehicles. Several members of the family are often killed by cars because none of the other ones will leave the scene once one has been hit. Unlike hares and antelope that meet the same fate, dead polecats do not seem to attract scavengers and will remain longer on the roads.
in deserts low (less than 30 cm per year) and unpredictable rainfall results in landscapes dominated by plants and animals adapted to aridity. Vegetation is typically sparse, though spectacular blooms may occur following rain. Deserts can be cold or warm and daily temperates typically fluctuate. In dune areas vegetation is also sparse and conditions are dry. This is because sand does not hold water well so little is available to plants. In dunes near seas and oceans this is compounded by the influence of salt in the air and soil. Salt limits the ability of plants to take up water through their roots.
a wetland area that may be permanently or intermittently covered in water, often dominated by woody vegetation.
The City of Champaign is divided into five City Council Districts, with a District Council representative elected from each. The geographic boundaries of the Council Districts are defined in Chapter 2 of the City Code. District Council members must live within the Council District they represent.

We want it to be known that speaking more than one language can be a pain sometimes. Sten in Swedish means stone. That being said, Sten is a legit name in Sweden, but still Sten the stoneface fits a bit too well.
Besides that, he still is one of my favorite companions of DA:O. Despite (or because) him being a stoneface I thought him absolutely hilarious at times.

Okay, I’m scatterbrained today, so this entry is unorganized and non-cohesive, as compared to my other ones, I guess.
Gave my presentation on UPnP today, which was both a joy and a nightmare at the same time. I didn’t prepare like I had wanted to, so I was just going up and talking about the knowledge that I had gained from researching for 4 hours the previous day. The good part is that the presentation went well by the standards of the class. The bad part is that it went horribly by my own standards. Overall, UPnP isn’t really a deep topic if you have knowledge of the tools that it uses to do it’s job: Multicast, HTTP-UDP, XML, and SOAP. If you don’t have knowledge, it would be a great project to build a UPnP client (or control point as the UPnP forum likes to call it) and a UPnP server (device). You would be forced to learn Multicast - something which I fully understand but haven’t actually coded yet - and the full range of HTTP using SOAP and XML, which despite it’s non-brevity I have to admit could actually be useful.
Overall UPnP is a good idea, and my favorite zero configuration network service location protocol so far. Today we looked at UPnP, Jini, SLP, and Salutation. It is simple, but can be very complex if needed. Unfortunately the creators decided to be smart and use Multicast, which means that most networks will not be able to handle it correctly. The fallout of this - if I wanted to use it in my home, I would have to install a “UPnP enabled” network hardware. It also means that it will never be used on the whole internet. There’s another reason why it won’t be used on the whole internet, however: it is too bandwidth-intensive. Granted, I don’t think there is a way to make a directory-less flexible zero configuration protocol with less bandwidth.
Some of the Mac Advocates (Zealots) out there are probably thinking I should look into Rendezvous. It’s something I’m working on, as well as looking into zeroconf. This is an area I’m fairly interested in, because I think it’s the future of computing - at some point I’m thinking we’ll have mature enough wireless that we will not even consider running cable, and at that point, we need devices to discover local services on their own. Printers is a start, but it could be just the beginning. Within this view are the problems of security, authentication (printing isn’t free anywhere I know of, and even if it was, how long will it take advertising companies to hire people to walk around with devices just broadcasting ads to all printers in range), and human computer interfaces.
Yesterday, I considered myself fairly productive. That was because the night before I actually got a project working (a sensor network simulator in QT), and then I started doing work like grading which always makes me feel productive because it doesn’t take long and it’s something I have to do. I also did the research for 4 hours, which I haven’t done in a while, but I don’t actually mind when I’m interested in the subject at hand. Not enough time lately to do such things.
Today, I don’t consider myself to be productive, even though I have already done laundry and ordering for the lab, and I plan to get some more stuff done later tonight if possible. This weekend I need to be productive - I have another presentation on tuesday on the sensor network simulator, which, while it is working, is far from a final product I could actually present.
I’ve considered lately making this journal friends-only and keeping non-Debian related stuff out of the public eye because I like to feed my ego and be in the semi-public eye. This is something I’m reluctant to do because I know people read this journal who don’t have an account on LJ and therefore couldn’t keep up with my daily life anymore (Hi Mom). Luckily, the University of Minnesota is a pretty cool school, and launched UThink, a blog service for any U of M student recently, so I’m thinking of getting one of those and using that for a feed into Planet Debian. Now to make myself a hackergotchi head. On the other hand, I may just use my advogato diary.
I’ve considered abusing LiveJournal recently - a large number of the journals syndicated on Planet Debian are LiveJournals, so if I want to comment on them, I’d rather just have the user’s journal entry to comment on. I’d also be able to see their real userpics in this situation. I’ve considered adding all of the people who are LJ users to my friends list and putting them into a “Debian LJ users” group so I can read them like my normal friends page. I could take the other blogs that are syndicated at Planet Debian and turn them into syndicated feeds here at LJ, which is easily possible since there are no syndication points anymore. After thinking about this a bit, I come to the conclusion that a bunch of these people would probably wonder why I friended them - I would be producing a footprint of friend-adding which is common to the serial adder. So I keep planetdebian on my friends list and read them that way instead, which is just a slight inconvenience.
Okay, that was much longer than expected, and I even have more to say, or at least I did while I was walking here from home.
There have been hundreds of golf instruction books written over the years. Few have reached “cult status, ” but one that has is Ben Hogan’s Five Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf. On Amazon,...
Fascinating! I just got an email from G2iX, the parent company of MorphLabs, inviting me to a webinar (Wed, Dec. 9, 2009 from 11AM - 12PM PST) in which they plan to demonstrate how to "Morph your Data Center into a Cloud Vendor":
Traditional data center and co-location vendors are under tremendous threat in the face of Amazon EC2 and related Web Services, and those providers who’re unable to adapt to some sort of cloud computing model face extinction as competing Infrastructure as a Service products become even more prevalent.
This webinar will demonstrate how the Morph Cloud Computing Platform can help regional data centers transform their business using their existing assets with minimal cost and hardware investments so that they can provide a cutting edge cloud solution to a broader customer base with rates that are more than competitive while still maintaining great profit margin.
For those who are unfamiliar with the company, MorphLabs provides a hosting platform that runs on top of Amazon's EC2 web service. So, assuming I'm not mistaken, G2iX plans to help data centers other than Amazon's set up the Morph platform to run on their own servers. My first thought was, "Why would they do that? Won't this just create competition for MorphLabs?!" However, once I mulled it over, I realized that if they structure things right, it could be quite beneficial to MorphLabs. What if these Morph platform deployments simply became new pools of servers to which Morph apps could be deployed? Viewed that way, it actually sounds quite clever. I'm almost tempted to attend the webinar, even though it has no direct relevance to me. :)
Almost from the inception of the Model A Restorer’s Club, the evaluation of the Model A has been a consistent theme. Beginning with the first National Meet held in Dearborn, Michigan in 1955 a 1931 Roadster owned by Russell J. Gerrits, Chicago, Illinois received the first place award. The initial judging criteria used for this meet consisted of approximately forty-five items for which a maximum number of points could be deducted. An example of one item of consideration was Lower Water Pipe, must be black – 2 Points.
Since that time the Judging Standards Committee (JSC) was formed and over the years one of the top priorities was the publication of judging standards to encourage the restoration and preservation of the Model A Ford by providing the membership with a continuing body of research and reference information which represented the most authenticated data available at that time. The scope of the Judging Standards also evolved to a twenty-four page version used in the early 1970’s addressing 27 areas.
In 1974, the Judging Standards Committee of the Model A Ford Club of America and the Model A Restorers Club worked together jointly and published the Model “A” Ford Judging Standards, a twenty-six page publication addressing twenty-six areas. Since that time, both National Clubs JSC’s have worked together and the initial joint effort was followed by an expanded version in 1981 and at this time the number of areas to be addressed was reduced to twenty-four.
In 1989, a new publication superseded the previous Judging Standards and was renamed the Model A Ford Judging Standards & Restoration Guidelines and the number of areas to be evaluated reduced to twenty-three. In 2006 this publication was renamed Model A Ford Restoration Guidelines & Judging Standards but is the same document with revisions made in 1994 and 1997. This spring Revision 3 (2011) will be issued to update the Model A Ford Restoration Guidelines & Judging Standards. This new revision is much more comprehensive than in the past and will supersede about half the previous RG & JS.
Over the years, many Model A enthusiasts have spent countless hours researching and authenticating information about the Model A Ford in order to provide the casual enthusiast, individuals interested in touring or those members who wish to restore a Model A Ford to the appearance of the typical 1928-1931 Ford as it was driven off the assembly line, except for authentic Ford accessories and safety items.
The JSC consists of twenty members from throughout the Model A world plus former JSC members who have elected Senior Status.
The Committee consists of a Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary and five different sections which have responsibilities for areas which the JSC has jurisdiction for:
Research Section – The purpose of this Section is to provide accurate and up-to date information for the authentic restoration and judging of Model A’s by researching information regarding production parts and assembly utilizing the Ford Motor Company archives and other available sources.
Judging Section – This Section is responsible for providing a Chief Judge for each National Meet for Fine Point Judging and coordinating all of the tasks associated with the judging process.
Credentials Section – This Section is charged with keeping and organizing records about members judging experience and seminar participation, checks qualifications for individuals applying for membership on the JSC and confirms qualifications for JSC members requesting Senior Status.
Education Section – Plans and organizes MARC Judging Schools (Seminars) at MARC Membership and National Meets.
Grievance Section – This Section’s responsibility is to investigate and answer all reported grievances in connection with matters which pertain to JSC responsibilities.
One of the important projects your Committee has been continuously involved with over the years has been the Model A Restoration Guidelines and Judging Standards. If you do not own this publication, check out the inside front cover of the Model A News and order one.
Finally, The JSC meets three times annually at the Membership Meet, National Meet and a weekend meeting in the Fall of each year.
By getting involved with the Judging process, a member will quickly learn more about the Model A Ford and will have an opportunity to judge some of the best examples of both restored and unrestored vehicles.
The initial step is to obtain a copy of the Model A Restoration Guidelines and Judging Standards and refer to the Judging the Model A section which contains the requirements for the various judge classifications. The second step is to volunteer to judge when you register for the National Meet. You will then become a part of the Judging process and you will be glad you got involved!
As an opening occurs on the JSC, the Chairman will publish in the Committee Report in the Model A News, an invitation for those interested members to advise the Chairman of their interest in writing and to provide a resume of their experience. These will be evaluated by the JSC and members will be so advised. Consideration of new members will include the following qualifications.
Restoration of a MARC of Excellence vehicle or entered a restored Model A in Fine Point Judging in a minimum of two National Meets.
Fine Point Judging Sheets – The JSC spent many hours developing judging sheets of the twenty-three areas in the present Model A Restoration Guidelines and Judging Standards (“Standards”) in order to more consistently and fairly judge the Model A Ford in Fine Point Judging. These have proved to be value in the judging process and with refinements in the future should be even more helpful.
In 2011 the MARC Judging Standards Committee created a new award called the “Roger Kauffman Award”. Roger was one of our most well known and recognizable members. As Technical advisor his column in the Model A News was one of the most popular. This award will honor his memory and passion for all that is Model A Ford. The award is not intended for the highest point total vehicle but the vehicle that Roger would have loved the most as it would have come “out of the barn”. The award is chosen by a select committee headed by Roger’s wife Diane. The inaugural Roger Kauffman Award was presented to Rob Mills 1929 AA Fire Truck.
The second winner of the Roger Kauffman Award was Bill Edstrom with a 400-A Convertible Sedan with 8000 original miles. This award was presented to Bill at the 2014 National Convention at French Lick Indiana.

The shoddy beard trim in Sigatoka meant that I was getting quite fluffy on my chin, so I went for an all over effort at Te Rapa Barber Shop in Hamilton.
"Traditional Mens Cuts", but what's this? A lady barber! OMFG! And what's more, a lady barber with attitude; rudely rebuking Deb's request to take photos (she took it anyway), scowling throughout the cut and generally acting the arse. The atmosphere made Vanessa and baby Carys flee the shop in terror!
Comments: Good effort, and quick too. Would have scored higher on cut quality but for the at-ti-tude.
I did try and warn you about Hamilton, but you guys insisted on going there. Now I see not just Hamilton but Te Rapa!!! bloody hell - suckers for punishment :)
Before we quit our jobs, Ben was a Copywriter and Debs was a Technical Author. We met in Leeds in November 1999, moved to Amsterdam in 2001, got married, bought a house, then quit our jobs to go travelling in 2007.

The ECHL All-Rookie team was announced last week, but as often happens with rookie honors, it was dominated by older rookies, 23 and 24-year-olds. Time has shown that it’s the very young players in the ECHL, the 21 and 22-year-olds, who are most likely to make the NHL, however.
Therefore, Hockey’s Future has created All 21-year-old and All 22-year-old teams for 2003-04 in order to highlight the young talent in the league. Selection was based on actual play during the season and potential to make the NHL. Statistics were taken into account, but were not the deciding factor. Rookies were favored over second year players and only those who played a majority of the year in the league were included. To read interviews with players done over the course of the season, click the on linked names.
The All-21 Team features four players out of the QMJHL. Michael Garnett is the only non-rookie of this group. The 2004 ECHL All-Star was a workhorse for the Gladiators when he was not called up to Chicago of the AHL, 21-10-2-1 with a 2.14 GAA and .926 save percentage in 33 games. Under contract with Atlanta, he’ll be in the AHL full time next season. He’s the surest bet of the group to make it someday.
Mathieu Brunelle, a draftee of the Philadelphia Flyers, spent his rookie season with affiliate Trenton. His speed, skill and tenacity made him exciting to watch as he put up 56 points in 64 games. He ranked second in rookie power play points with 28. Listed at 5’11″, 181 pounds, Brunelle turned 21 only this week.
Charles Linglet had a down year in junior last year, but bounced right back in his rookie pro season with 55 points in 62 games, and was named to the All-Star game. He will no doubt get a chance at a higher level next year. He has good size at 6’2”, 212 pounds.
Jonathan Gagnon is a very dynamic player who had a bit of an adjustment period at first, improved as the season went on. He ended with 40 points in 63 games, with a 16.3 shooting percentage. He has a very high upside. Once he fills out, he should be ready to take on bigger challenges.
Paul Ballantyne is a defensive defenseman, but he scored more than anyone expected this year in the ECHL, with 37 points in 57 games. Under contract with Detroit, he was reassigned to Louisiana at the end of the year once Toledo was out of the playoffs in order to get more games in. He has a very bright future and should move up to Grand Rapids next season.
Maxime Fortunus is remarkable on this All-21 team because he is actually still only 20 years old. His spectacular +28 put him fourth best among rookies. He had 18 points in 64 games on the blue line.
Jesse Schultz, F, Columbia – Schultz had 47 points, more than Gagnon, but he played on a much better team and doesn’t have as much of the upside.
Nate Kiser D, Dayton – Kiser, a defensive defenseman, was an ECHL All-Star game selection in his rookie year. His –13 is a product of being on a losing team, not of poor performance. He brought his PIM levels way down from junior, only 114 in 63 games but retained the same level of offense, 15 points in 63 games.
David Masse, LW, Reading – Masse was able to convert his offensive game from the QMJHL to the ECHL, scoring 47 points in 53 games, earning him an All-Star selection. While not huge, at 6’0” 175 pounds, he’s big enough that size won’t hold him back.
Frederic Cloutier was an ECHL Western Conference starter in the All-Star game. Platooning with partner Derek Gustafson, he was 20-8-1-2 with a 2.31 GAA and a .920 save percentage in 32 games. Rebounding after a tough year last year, Cloutier is under contract with Minnesota.
Tim Smith was not only be best 22-year-old in the league, he was arguably the best overall, leading the league in scoring with a spectacular 95 points. He moved up the charts over the course of the season, a mark of improvement. Smith is a small, speedy winger who works hard at both ends of the ice. A second year pro, he’s under contract with the Vancouver Canucks.
Carl Mallette is a first year pro out of the QMJHL, after a one-year stopover with Dalhousie University of the CIS. He scored 71 points in 73 games, good for fourth among rookies.
Jamie Johnson is a playmaking center who finished fifth in the rookie scoring race with 57 points in 71 games. He is 5’11” 185 pounds. Coming from the OHL, he was among good company with the many good young prospects on the Louisiana IceGators.
Brian Fahey joined Atlantic City as a rookie defenseman out of the University of Wisconsin. He had seemed to lose his scoring touch after his freshman year with the Badgers, but found it again with the Boardwalk Bullies, with 37 points in 55 games on the back line. He was also an impressive +21 and was an All-Star selection as well.
Andreas Holmqvist was expected to compete for a job on the Tampa Bay Lightning last fall. His failure to make the team was Pensacola’s gain. He scored 37 points in his North American debut and was +8 in 63 games. He’s likely played his last game in the league as Tampa Bay will have a full AHL affiliation next year and not need to send as many players to Pensacola.
Olivier Proulx, F, Dayton – Proulx is a rookie out of the QMJHL. His 53 points put him tied for 12th among rookies. He tied for second in rookie shorthanded points with five.
Cory Campbell, G, Johnstown/Toledo – Campbell spent a year in the UHL after junior before moving to the ECHL. Traded midseason, overall he was 9-7-1-3 with a 2.04 GAA and .922 save percentage in 19 games.
Paul Flache, D, Gwinnett – Flache improved steadily over the course of the season, earning him a number of games in the AHL. This was his second year pro, after missing a large chunk of games last year with illness. While mostly concentrating on defense, he had 18 points in 62 games and was +18. Under contract with Atlanta, he’ll play in the AHL with Chicago next year.
Jason Jaffray, F, Wheeling – It’s hard to argue with numbers like these, 74 points in 54 games and a +20. At 6’1” 204-pounds, 2002-03 ECHL Rookie of the Year Jaffray has the raw materials to develop.
Randall Gelech started his major junior career during the 2000-01 season with the Kelowna Rockets of the WHL. He was named to the 2001 U-17 Team Western for the World Hockey Challenge in Nova Scotia. After shaking off an below average 2001-02 season, Gelech had a breakout year during the 2002-03 season as with Kelowna. The team made it deep into the playoffs but went home empty handed. Gelech was also named to the RE/MAX Canada/Russia Challenge series for 2003. During the 2003-04 season he had another superb year and the Rockets made it back into the playoffs and into the CHL finals. Not only did the Kelowna end up winning the Memorial Cup, but Gelech was also named to the Memorial Cup All-Star Team for his outstanding play.
No other Utah Grizzlies player offered up more surprising play during the 2004-05 season than Gelech. After a solid junior career with the Kelowna Rockets of the Western Hockey League, the rookie forward made a smooth transition to the professional game. Gelech had an impressive year playing on the Grizzlies checking line and filling a spot on the club’s top penalty-killing unit. Although he saw limited time on the Utah power play, he was a consistent contributor. His 15 goals, (five power play goals), and 12.6 shooting percentage were each good enough for second on the Grizzlies squad.
Gelech is a player that every team loves to have. He is very intense and considered an energy player. He is a good skater with decent speed. He is a tenacious forechecker and his size (6’3, 212) complements his works hard on the forecheck and around the net. He possesses soft hands and a nose that helps him find ways to score. He uses the body and finishes his checks. He has good overall ability and skill. He will earn his respect from his persistence and determination because he will give you the same intensity and gritty play every night.

We visited the Dutch artist Birgit Stigter in her atelier close to Botanischer Garten on Sunday. Birgit is a cosmopolitan, she has moved 15 times in her life and has now arrived finally in Berlin two years ago. Throughout the years she has developed a creative process to explore exciting places and to make new international friends, in Dutch Vriendjes. Riding her bike, Birgit looks for inspiring places where famous artist live or used to live and documents them with her Hasselblad analog camera. Often she is noticed while doing this and occasionally she is even invited in; other times she talks to curious neighbors or to random people, who give her insider tips for the next interesting spot to explore. After developing the pictures at her atelier, she uses a mask to paint over the images her new friends of the day. The result is an enchanting series that juxtaposes old and new friends with magical places around the world. Bridges are another main theme of Birgit's work – Dutch and German Überbrücken. Her grandfather was a captain and ship owner and in her hometown Gorinchem she spent a lot of time right next to the bridge in the artist quarter Zaltbommel. Bridges are "in her system" ever since – "they establish connections in a literal as well as a figurative sense." Birgit captures large steel bridges into monumental artworks like her first Berlin bridge, the historical Glienicker Brücke, where East and West German Spys were exchanged. If you want to know more or want your individual piece of art, just contact her – Birgit is always happy to make new Vriendjes.
The UVM Department of History is excited to welcome our esteemed colleague, Mr. Calvin Trillin, to campus for his public lecture “The Writing Life” on Wednesday September 27 (5:00, Ira Allan Chapel). It is true that Mr. Trillin’s brilliant credentials as a historian are often, and inexplicably, overlooked. But within the field he is revered for such classics as “An Attempt to Compile a Short History of the Buffalo Chicken Wing” (which he figured, wrongly, would be “an easy task compared to, say, a medievalist whose specialty requires him to poke around in thirteenth-century Spain”), “A Very Short History of the Fish Taco,” and of course the methodological tour de force “An Attempt to Compile the Definitive History of Didee’s Restaurant” (“I might have given up the history game right there if it hadn’t been for the baked duck and dirty rice”). Like all great historians, if somewhat more literally than most, Mr. Trillin evinces an inexhaustible appetite for the evidence. The talk should be over in time for dinner.

Definely funny weird, rather than funny ha-ha. Now I’m in my mid-thirties (I know it’s hard to believe with my youthful good looks…) I, like most people, have been in a few. Sometimes – say at the arrival of a child, it’s a happy time. Sometimes it’s just plain sad, when you’re saying goodbye to someone or watching the erstwhile strong fade away. Quite often, though, it just feels like something you do, something to get through, unpleasant in many senses but just kind of there, a gentle reminder that life doesn’t always go entirely to plan.
Which is a terribly roundabout way of saying that we’re here again. This time Rohan is the troublemaker: a cold turned into a bad cold turned into a chesty thing turned into what doctors now think is ‘Bronchialitus’ (no, I hadn’t heard of it, either). He’s gonna be fine, but is in a plastic hood whotsit while he fights the virus. He also has a feeding tube and an ET-like glowing toe attachment. It all looks alarming but is actually quite straightforward. The hood is the baby version of an oxygen mask to just help him breathe a bit easier, the tube means he doesn’t have to expend valuable energy and air on eating, and the glowing toe thing measures his heart rate and blood oxygen. I know about the latter because I – sadly – looked it up on my PDA and discovered that it works because light is absorbed differently depending on how the blood is oxygenated. It doesn’t, unfortunately, give Rohan the means to signal to alien beings, which is a shame because I’ve always fancied a ride up there and he’s way cuter than ET ever was.
Most of the time the defining feature of hospitals is the waiting. And that’s why I’m here, writing a blog post on my phone, waiting for the next feed, the next night, the next day and of course for him to get better.
In some senses I’m the ideal person to have around during times like this: I’m terribly calm, very pragmatic and generally fairly unphased. In other ways, I can see that I’d be a right pain in the arse: it just doesn’t come naturally for me to worry and I can see that I could easily come across as a cold fish. Working out the medical tech and blogging from hospital sound like echoes from a Daily Mail headline: “‘Mr Ellis sat cooly by’ said one nurse who refused to be named, ‘…all he cared about was the gadgetry…'”
Anyway. There was a funny moment last night just before I left Rach and Rohan here. He’d been miserable all day with lots of coughing and crying. Then the nurse put the hood on him and within about 5 minutes of the oxygen starting an enormous grin was on his face. He looked like a dodgy clubber coming up on a handful of E: red, watery eyes, pale skin and a huge ear-to-ear smile…
Anyway, young Rohan. Here’s the bottom line: you might be a little bit noisy at night and mildly grumpy from time to time. I do like you quite a lot, though, and much as I’m a gadget fan, it’d be better to play with them at home, ok? Get well as soon as you can. I miss you, and it’s only been 24 hours.

Eva is in hospital with the same thing now and has been in for 4 days, following several visits to the GP. I am fairly laid back also, but I wish the doctors (of which we have now seen 3 GPs, 3 Drs. 3 Registrars, 1 Clinical Head and 2 Consultants, plus numerous students) would tell us what they know. We have been told of at least a dozen things that Eva hasn’t got and the reason why she hasn’t got them. Bronchialitus she also hasn’t got according to the Lab, but one Doctor believes she has and certainly her blood oxygen level is falling, and she is not feeding properly. Eventually we (the wife and I) boxed a Doctor into a corner and would let her go until she told us what was going on. And wasn’t it so simple. Eva has an infection in her throat, (upper respiratory tract) and it’s viral (because she has no temperature) and is not treatable – it will get better on it’s own. But she needs to be monitored for blood/oxygen saturation and food intake in case she needs what Rohan has (oxygen tent and food tube). We are not there yet, but she is deteriating and we are down to 93% saturation – 2 more points and the tent beckons. I hope these explanations help others who can’t make head nor tail of Doctor speak.
Hey Dave, thanks for commenting. Lack of information is a massive problem, and it seems to be one which everyone suffers from when talking to the medical profession. You’d assume that seven years of training – or however long it is – would make for good communicators too, but that just doesn’t seem to be the case.
Either way, the important thing is that Eva gets better soon – I hope you’re outta there soon and back home.

"We recommend that pet owners be aware of which items around their homes can be harmful to their pets," advises Carol McConnell, DVM. Pet owners must not "assume that their pets will ignore that bottle of bleach in the laundry room. Our data shows this just isn't so."
You can make your house pet friendly by eliminating or securing harmful items, including medications, insect poisons, chocolate, and certain nuts. Other toxic or harmful items:
Talk with your veterinarian during each visit about ways they can help you create a safe, non-toxic environment for your pets.
Keeping your house pet friendly is critical to the health and wellness of your pets. Just what does pet friendly mean? A pet friendly house is a sheltered location for an animal to live, play and relax that is clean, safe, free from hazards and toxic materials. Most pets share house space with their owner. Household items used in a house by an owner are available to the pets. Many of these materials used by owners can be unsafe or deadly to pets.
"Properly storing and locking up hazardous items is the first step to preventing accidental poisonings," advises Janet Tobiassen Crosby, DVM in Common Household Poisons. If you haven't made your house pet friendly, do it now. It will be easiest to move from one room to another checking closets, cabinets, boxes, shelves, and drawers. Yes, drawers - adept, curious pets can easily get into them!
"Not only can a poisoning incident be life-threatening for the pet, it's traumatic for the pet owner," said Carol McConnell, DVM, vice president and chief veterinary medical officer for Veterinary Pet Insurance. "We recommend that pet owners be aware of which items around their homes can be harmful to their pets-medications, insect poisons, chocolate and certain nuts-and keep these items safely out of reach. They shouldn't assume that their pets will ignore that bottle of bleach in the laundry room or the Philodendron plant by the window. Our data shows this just isn't so."
It could be a good idea to isolate your pet for a few minutes while you remove and secure substances that can be harmful. Pets may enjoy chewing through storage containers you consider safe. Remember that child-proof does not mean pet proof!
Common Household Poisons by veterinarian Janet Tobiassen Crosby suggests properly storing and securing items that can harm your pet. Ensure that they are stored up high and out of reach of all pets (and children) in your home. Your pet doesn't know ingesting these items can harm or kill them.
These items are used to maintain your home, the furnishings, and items in it. They may be located in your laundry room, kitchen, bathrooms, or garage. Secure abrasives, soaps, waxes, disinfectants, powders, aerosol and pump sprays, paints, lubricants, bleach, fabric softeners, and water softener supplies.
In addition to storing where pets cannot reach or gain access to these items, use only the recommended doses. Always follow the dosing schedule.
Pets can be attracted to this sweet tasting, brightly colored liquid. "One swallow may be lethal for small animals," Crosby advises.
"One of the most common household poisons are medications - either discovered by the pet or purposely administered by the owner," Crosby says. Your veterinarian must guide you with giving any medications to your pets. Over-the-counter and prescription drugs require authorization from your veterinarian. "Accidental poisonings, especially from NSAIDs are very common," she says.
Xylitol is an artificial sweetener that can be toxic to animals. It is often found in foods labeled as "sugar free." Chocolate, caffeine, raisins, and grapes are known toxins for pets.
"The sheer mix of items in a trash can (may) make a pet owner forget the combined potential hazard," alerts Crosby. Cleanser containers, food scraps, broken and sharp objects could severely harm a pet who wouldn't usually bother a trash can. "Make sure your trash is secure."
Just like their canine counterparts, cats need stimulation. Boredom in cats can prevent itself as inter-cat aggression, over eating, anxiety or over-grooming as seen similarly in dogs, but environment enrichment can help here too. Since cats are such sensory driven creatures, puzzles and games are some of the best ways to appeal to their natural instinct — and make for a far more confident and less stressed cat. You can use some of the following tools to quickly enhance your cat’s living space and make sure she is happy, healthy and stress free.
Scratch posts allow your cat to indulge in a habit that comes naturally, while reducing stress and stretching muscles at the same time.
Puzzle feeders engage your cat’s hunting instinct and ability and keeps the mind moving, even at dinner time.
Tunnels and hideaways are simple and necessary for even the most confident cat. Make your own fabric tunnels for hours of endless fun.
Does your dog like to bark, dig and chew everything in his line of sight? Before you panic and head straight for doggy boot camp, the solution may be simpler than you think. Just as humans do, dogs get bored. Unlike humans, however, dogs have fewer means of passing the time. Instead, bored dogs can develop unhealthy behaviors and stress-related habits, such as excessive personal licking or chewing, which can potentially cause them harm.
Environment enrichment is the process of making your pet’s living space engaging and stimulating in order to decrease boredom and avoid any associated consequences. Keeping your pets busy and engaged with mental games, active training and enough daily exercise will protect both your pets and your furniture. You can thank us later.
There are a few simple ways to improve your furry friend’s immediate living space and help encourage mental and physical development, including the following:
Toys that dispense food are an excellent way for your dog to beat daily stress and boredom. Keeping your dog busy while you’re gone by making them work for treats, or their entire meal, keeps them interested and engaged. They are far less likely to be distracted by an arm chair or potential digging spot if they are being rewarded and encouraged with their favorite foods. Additionally, using toys that encourage dogs to eat more slowly can even improve digestive health.
As wonderful as engaging toys and human interaction can be for your pets, other dogs provide stimulation that we simply cannot. Regular play dates with other friendly dogs is one of the best ways to keep your dog learning and consistently engaged. Provide your pup with the opportunity to run, sniff and explore a new, safe space with a brand-new friend!
Much like humans, dogs need variation to keep them learning and developing. Whenever you can, provide your pup with the opportunity to explore new spaces. Maybe try a new trail on your morning walk, take a trip to the beach or pack your smaller furry friend into a secure bike basket and go for a ride. Allowing your dog to experience new things will keep his senses keen and improve both his physical and mental health.
If you have any further questions about environment enrichment, or any unhealthy behaviors you have seen appear in your pet, contact your veterinarian for additional resources and support.

Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) is the NHS programme introduced by New Labour to roll out services across England that it was hoped would help people with depression and anxiety disorders more effectively than drug treatments.
It sounds sensible, until you discover three things: how shockingly few patients are being helped by the programme; that it costs three times more than it was originally budgeted for and that it was relying almost solely on Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) as treatment.
In the early days of IAPT, a number of performance criteria were established for the programme. They included the aspirations that, by 2015, the programme should be treating 900,000 patients annually; that it should obtain pre- and post-treatment outcome data for at least 90 per cent of people treated, and that by 2010/11 50 per cent of those completing treatment should have moved to recovery. Against those targets, how has it performed?
In the 2012–13 period, the headline recovery rate for those 'records that were eligible for outcome assessment and were at caseness at the beginning of treatment' is 43 per cent – seven per cent short of the 50 per cent target. Unfortunately that headline rate is often all we hear of IAPT; there is much more to the story.
A total of 883,968 new referrals were received by IAPT services, representing 761,848 people. Of those referred, just 434,247 (49 per cent) entered treatment. That's rather short of IAPT's original target of 900,000 people treated annually. With less than one year to go to 2015, more than doubling the number entering treatment seems rather unlikely.
A total of 534,721 referrals were recorded as ended in the year, but not all were happy endings – 50 per cent of ended referrals are attributed to patients either declining or dropping out of treatment.
The pool of people who could show recovery (defined as those who had two or more treatment sessions, were above the caseness threshold on at least one key measure at the start, and below the threshold on the PHQ-9 and anxiety measures at close) was 127,060. It is from this figure that the recovery rate is calculated. The actual number achieving recovery is 54,430. While this is indeed 43 per cent of those who could recover, it is also just 12 per cent of those entering treatment – quite a contrast with the original aspiration of 50 per cent of those completing the programme moving to recovery.
Without getting lost in the detail, this suggests that a combination of many people either not achieving a 'case' level of distress and/ or high levels of drop-out is contributing to the fact that little more than one in 10 of people entering treatment can be shown to have demonstrably improved.
So not only is IAPT significantly under-performing against its stated aims, but it is costing over three times more than was originally estimated. Parity of esteem between mental and physical health may be the coalition Government's stated intention, but it is hard to imagine how a level of demonstrable benefit as low as this would be tolerated in physical health.
Human Givens practitioners predicted this waste of public money when we realised that IAPT was to naively rely on CBT as a methodology.
Compare these statements with the main conclusions and recommendations from peer reviewed research into the effectiveness of Human Givens therapy in treating depression which gets results three times faster than control groups receiving conventional counselling, CBT or drug treatment:
1. That the HG model be officially considered by the NHS as a bona fide model of therapy in its own right. This would greatly hasten the implementation of further studies and ease commissioning from managers acquainted with, and confused by, the variety of therapeutic models to choose from.
2. That NICE should be made aware of some of the techniques used by this approach. The most obvious candidate for this would be the imaginal exposure technique known as ‘rewind’, which has much in common with established imaginal exposure techniques used in CBT and already approved by NICE.
3. That training in the HG methodology and concepts be formally accepted as a mainstream option for CPD within the mental health community.
Educate yourself about accurate, effective and up-to-date information about mental health and therapy. We are striving to make this easier all the time, with online training, face-to-face courses and the Human Givens Diploma.
Our publications include books (both physical and on Kindle), CDs and the biannual Human Givens journal.

Domestic violence is a confrontation between family or household members involving physical harm, harassment, sexual assault, or reasonable fear of physical harm. Family or household members include spouses/former spouses, those in (or formerly in) a dating relationship, including gay/lesbian couples; adults related by blood or marriage; and those who have a child in common or legal parent-child relationship.
Domestic violence is a pattern of behavior used by an individual to establish and maintain control over another individual. It can include physical abuse. Abusive behavior can involve the following:
We have moved to the Justice & Municipal Center in downtown Bonney Lake (adjacent to the Library). Call (253) 862-6606 for more information.
The Bonney Lake Municipal Court offers computer access for victims of domestic violence who need to file a temporary protection order. The Domestic Violence Kiosk allows people in Pierce County to access help without having to travel to the Tacoma Pierce County-City Building in downtown Tacoma.
Individuals can file requests for a protection orders or sexual assault orders via the Domestic Violence Kiosk system. The court clerk contacts the Domestic Violence Unit in Tacoma upon completion of data entry, and the County Clerk's office completes the filing and provides it to a commissioner or judge for signature.
Once approved, the individual returns to Bonney Lake City Hall, enters the confirmation code, and prints the signed order in duplicate along with an Affidavit of Service. The local law enforcement or sheriff's office then serves the order depending on whether the respondent lives inside or outside the city limits. The victim may also choose to have a private individual serve the order.
The signed order becomes a valid temporary protection order for 14 days from the date of issuance. These orders also provide a court date and time for the victim and respondent to appear in court to determine if it will become a permanent order.
Until the order is served, there is no violation if there is contact between the parties during the 14 day temporary period. For information, contact the Municipal Court directly at (253) 862-6606.
Additional kiosks are located around Pierce County at various locations including the cities of Gig Harbor, Lakewood, Sumner, and University Place, as well as a location South Hill and another in Eatonville at the Pierce County Sheriff's Mountain Detachment. For a current list of kiosks located throughout Pierce County, view the Pierce County Help Center.
Nearly 5.3 million incidents of domestic violence occur each year among U.S. women ages 18 and older, and 3.2 million occur among men (CDC 2000).
Domestic violence results in nearly 2 million injuries and 1,300 deaths nationwide every year (CDC 2003).
The U.S. Department of Justice reported that 37% of all women who sought care in hospital emergency rooms for violence-related injuries were injured by a current or former spouse, boyfriend or girlfriend.
Domestic violence affects everyone in the community and certain myths need to be dispelled. People often say' that they were raised in a "good" or "normal" family and believe domestic violence happens only to "bad" families.
Statistics show myths such as this not to be true. Batterers and victims come from all races, ages, genders, sexual orientations, socio-economic backgrounds, religious affiliations, occupations and educational backgrounds.
Domestic violence and its victims still bear an undeserved stigma in our society and until we all understand its nature, the batterers and the victims, the cycle will continue. No one is immune but with education and awareness, people can prevent tragedy from claiming more lives.
Domestic violence is a serious crime that affects children living in the home, and who may become victims themselves. Seniors too can be at risk for elder abuse, by in-home caretakers.
Domestic violence is a pattern of behavior used by an individual to establish and maintain control over another individual.
Batterers use violence or threats to obtain and maintain control. They blame others for their violence and don't take responsibility for their actions. They blame their abusive behavior on stress, anger, jealousy and the victim. There are three phases, or cycle of violence:
Phase 3: Calm stage when the perpetrator may deny violence, say it was because of alcohol or drug abuse, apologize and promise it will never happen again.
Batters come from all races, ages, genders, sexual orientations, socio-economic backgrounds, religious affiliations, occupations, and educational backgrounds. They may display:

Yes, it’s very much possible to get a degree from other parts of the world even at the convenience of your home. Sounds impossible but it really happens. With the emergence of online degrees, you can now choose any degree you want from institutions worldwide. No time and money wasted.
Not too long ago, there was a predominant notion etched firmly in most people’s minds, pertaining to the duration and methods of obtaining a degree level of education. Common belief was that for one to obtain a degree, you had to slump through four years of full time classes. This was the only way anybody knew of how to get a degree. However, with technological revolution being prevalent, over the past few years, this has gradually changed and education as well as its various systems is bound to follow suit. There are various other methods of getting degrees other than the traditional class scenario which frankly, was rather boring as well as monotonous and its long term effects were not in any way desirable. People only went to school to get a degree for the formality and nothing more. With technology coupled with people’s gradual increase in desire for knowledge, all this has changed the age old question “How to get a degree” to “When to get a degree”
There exists the traditional way of attending classes in campus for the set period of time stipulated by the relative responsible individuals. This, as is stated, is the more traditional way to get a degree. This may be at whichever level in one’s selected field. Generally, this is the most widely accepted of the ways of how to get a degree. It imparts not only knowledge into the student, but it also develops experience and general life skills that are relevant in each and every one’s life. Going to campus is indeed the most widely accepted way out of all the available ways there are on how to get a degree, however, despite its countless advantages on the general skills that are acquired during the brief period when an individual is in campus, this particular method has one huge disadvantage, and this is the fact that students once in campus, students tend to get carried away by the numerous pleasures of life and this in the long term, negatively influences their education to the extent that some students may get arrested, or others killed while others may be excommunicated from the campus due bad and unruly behavior. For those who get a degree in the campus, there is a huge negative effect since the main reason for going to college or campus was to impart the relevant amount of knowledge within the selected field! Therefore, if you are wondering how to get a degree in the field you love but have no self control, this may not be the most appropriate way to do that.
For those who are very serious about how to get a degree and what it is they would like to study, there is the option of distance learning. This takes advantage of the most recent and constant technological changes taking place currently within the world with the most important of these developments being the World Wide Web. It has facilitated constant communication between the instructors and the students, as well as equipping the same students with a great deal of material in their respective fields if they get a degree. In this type of learning aimed to get a degree, student is clearly able to conduct their personal research in the field that he or she is undertaking. The good thing is that the student is completely driven by himself to go an extra mile to obtain that extra bit of information. The instructor only guides the student on what it is that he or she will research and nothing more, aside from explaining simple concepts that may be troubling the student. In that case, anybody wondering how to get a degree, my advice to them would be to do it online. Aside from being a lot faster as well as cheaper, the method facilitates the imparting of knowledge. This should therefore change the question how to get a degree to when to get a degree.
What is the probability that both answers are correct. Based on the results, does guessing appear to be a good strategy. Acceptance Sampling With one method of a procedure called acceptance sampling, a sample of items is randomly selected without replacement and the entire batch is accepted if every item in the sample is okay. The Telektronics Company manufactured a batch of 400 backup power supply units for computers, and 8 of them are defective.

In the Western Roman Empire, a commander-in-chief evolved with the title of magister utriusque militiae and this powerful office was often the power behind the throne and was held by Stilicho, Flavius Aetius, Ricimer, and others. In the East, there were two generals, who were each appointed to the office of magister militum praesentalis. In the course of the 6th century, internal and external crises in the provinces often necessitated the temporary union of the regional civil authority with the office of the magister militum. In the establishment of the exarchates of Ravenna and Carthage in 584, indeed, after the loss of the eastern provinces to the Muslim conquest in the 640s, the surviving field armies and their commanders formed the first themata.

"If it's a thriller you're after, The Wilding doesn't disappoint, taking a story as old as the woods and fashioning it into something a bit sleeker and more psychological — a bit closer to where we live."
Echo Canyon is a disappearing pocket of wilderness outside of Bend, Oregon, and the site of conflicting memories for Justin Caves and his father Paul. It’s now slated for redevelopment as a golfing resort. When Paul suggests one last hunting trip, Justin accepts, hoping to get things right with his father this time, and agrees to bring his son Graham along.As the weekend unfolds, Justin is pushed to the limit by the reckless taunting of his father, the physical demands of the terrain, and the menacing evidence of the hovering presence of bear. All the while, he remembers the promise he made to his skeptical wife: to keep their son safe.
Percy is very good at wreaking havoc with his many interconnected plots and then remaking, metaphorically and literally. He is also a courageous realistic who presents unpalatable truths.
…his writing is as natural, dark, and deep as the woods he writes about. At 31, Percy is as promising a writer as anyone on a certain New York magazine’s list of promising writers under 40.
The Wilding is an urgent and haunting look at the darker side of our nature and at our often futile attempts to control and manage the natural world.
Percy’s writing in this novel is recklessly passionate, ferocious and fast-paced, but his thinking about these subjects is profound and carefully reasoned.
If it’s a thriller you’re after, The Wilding doesn’t disappoint, taking a story as old as the woods and fashioning it into something a bit sleeker and more psychological — a bit closer to where we live.
..powerfully written first novel……he delineates his characters with a knife-sharp psychological edge.
Just as Percy demonstrates how men manage danger, he’s equally adept at revealing the odd ways men also create it. Percy’s rendering of their psychological dance is masterful.
Percy’s novel perfectly captures our ambiguous attitudes toward the natural world, the tensions between rural and urban, the way that untamed wildness carries both grace and terror.
The Wilding wraps its arms around some big themes: the vanishing wilderness, a dissolving marriage, and the shell-shocked re-adjustment to domestic life after combat. It’s a lot to pack into 250 pages, but Percy manages to do it with remarkable ease.
The press’ role in keeping the president in check has been an intricate part of the United States’ Democracy since the nation’s founding. And in what Dan Rather has dubbed “the Trump era, whether one likes it or not,” the relationship between the White House and the press could venture into unchartered territory.
Many press outlets have been criticized by the president-elect, often on Twitter, and the White House Correspondents Association president penned stern statements directed at the incoming administration’s treatment of journalists and lack of protective press pool.
Rather — an over six-decade veteran of the trade — reflected on his lengthy career and the responsibilities of the free press during his Radio Andy show on Tuesday,
“For all of my professional life, I’ve tried to be an accurate and fair journalist,” Rather explained. “One dedicated to both the idea and the ideal of ‘objective reporting’ which has become a little non-trendy these days. But, objective reporting, to me, is you try to be an honest broker of information as drained of bias and personal prejudice as humanly possible, understanding that there are limits to that with an inner voice saying ‘play no favorites, pull no punches.'”
He continued, “Now, that’s what I’ve dedicated my professional life to trying to be and to do. Others have to judge how well or how poorly I have succeeded. I can only attest this is what I’ve tried to do and I’ve given all I have and continue to do so.”
Rather has been incredibly vocal on his Facebook page, often penning long essays about the current state of political affairs.
“With that very much in mind, I have been searching my conscious lately while girding for coverage of a whole new presidential era — a presidential era for better, for worse, with a whole different tone. So I’ve been searching my conscious about, you know, how to deal with what promises to be unprecedented in its tone and implications for the future of our constitutional Republic, this new era that we’re moving into.”
Rather concluded, “in that context, yes, I do wonder about the strength of our society to not succumb to what has happened to other Republics, such as Rome, and other experiments in Democracy since the Ancient Greeks. And I’m not going heavy on you here but I think any responsible citizen of whatever partisan political lore or ideological persuasion would always have to have, should have, foremost in their mind, ‘what about the country? What about the institutions that are supposed to supply the check and balance on any power, at any level’ and one of those institutions being a free and independent — fiercely independent when necessary — press.”

Modern living places our backs under a lot of stress. We spend a lot of time curved over our computers and smartphones. Then there’s driving, groceries and carrying children, and many other actions that place important demands on our backs. That’s why it’s so vital to keep a strong, toned back specially for women. Here are some women back workout:
Stand with feet in a splitting stance place with your right foot onward. Your left toe should be near 10 inches after your right heel. Take your arms up so that your fingertips are just beyond your ears. Drag your elbows back.
Tugging from your core, elevate your upper body up to an erect place. Tight at the top place, squeezing the muscles of your middle back.
Kneel down on your workout mat on all fours. Your hands should be straightforwardly under your shoulders. Keep a neutral spine place. Pull in your stomach strengths and keep your hips steady.
Prolong your right arm straight out in front of you to shoulder level. Maintain the left hand tightly on the floor. With your abdominals tugged in, opposite the motion to take the right arm down and the left arm up to shoulder level. Sense for the flexion in your back muscles as you does the movement.
This is a complete upper-body women back workout that highlights your lats (the muscles that benefit you pull your arm down and back).
Recline on your back on a bench (or surface if you don’t have a work surface), feet flat on the work surface (or surface), knees twisted; keep a weight in each hand or a weight in each hand above your chest, arms straight up. Lower the mass or weights straight back after your head till your arms are in line with your torso and parallel to the surface. If you are not using a work surface, lower your arms till the weights are just over but not touching the surface.
Maintain your arms straightforward; pull your arms to initial place over your chest. As you reach initial place, think about tapering your lat muscles. Perform one to two sets of 15 replications each.
Back rows work your full back and can effort your main muscles if you keep your stomach muscles tugged in and your back flat.
Stand with your feet shoulder-width separately, arms at your edges, a dumbbell in both hands. Curve your knees somewhat, pushing your hips back, and curve onward at your hips without turning your back. Grasp the weights straight down from your shoulders with your wrists fronting back and your knuckles facing onward. Tug the weights straight up to the edges, twisting your elbows, while retaining your torso in the similar place. You are only touching your arms, not the rest of your body. Squash your shoulder blades jointly as your elbows touch to the ceiling.
Gradually lower the weights to initial place. Make sure to retain your back flat. Perform one to two sets of 15 replications each.
Stand holding a soft pair of dumbbells with feet shoulder width separately. Grasp the weights on your sides with arms minor twisted and locked at the elbows. Keep a neutral spine.
Elevate both arms out to your edges. Think of trying to carry your shoulder blades jointly, while keeping a minor twist in your elbows. Halt when your hands are at shoulder level. Grasp for 2 seconds.
Keeping a dumbbell in both hands, balance your weight on your left foot, bending onward at the hips and raising your right leg so it shapes a T with your torso and left leg. Your chest and right leg are parallel to the surface and your shoulders are four-sided square to the surface.
Grasp the weights under your shoulders; arms straightforward (remain stable on your left leg). Tug the weights straightforward up to your edges, retaining your shoulders four-sided square to the surface, and squash your shoulder blades jointly.
Gradually lower weights to initial (you are still stable on one leg) and replicate for eight repetitions. Change legs and replicate for eight repetitions. Perform two sets.
This is a full-body women back workout that will make you sense robust from head to toe. You work your legs with the squat while directing your upper and lower back with the overhead lift.
Grasp a dumbbell in both hands, one dumbbell weighing double as much as the other (e.g., if one dumbbell is five pounds, the other one should be 10 pounds). Stand with your feet shoulder-width separately and toes piercing straight forward.
Grasp the gentle dumbbell overhead in your hand, with the weightier dumbbell between your legs, keeping both arms straight. Push your hips back and lower yourself till your upper thighs are parallel to the surface, keeping the lighter dumbbell straight up above your shoulders, upper back muscles and tightening the back of your shoulder. Retain your abs tugged in tight.
Rise back to the initial place and perform one to two sets of 15 replications each. Change arms and replicate.

This was something that first occurred to me last summer. I'm curious about whether it rings true for anyone else out there, or if there are any other suggestions for it.
The setup for the idea is this: Take two people who are in a relationship and pick a single personality trait or attribute. Each person probably has a specific comfort zone with respect to that trait. That is, they have an equilibrium state (or narrow range of states) outside of which they feel an imbalance and a desire to return to "safety." I'm sure we can all relate to this on an individual level. Now, since we have two unique individuals here, I think it's safe to assume that their comfort zones are different for some set of traits (probably many, depending on how finely you want to slice the notions of traits and significant differences).
In this situation, my theory says that each person will seek the same equilibrium state for the relationship as a whole as they would desire for themselves individually. If one partner creates an imbalance for the other (as may happen naturally if their comfort zones are different) then the other partner will try to counter that imbalance by behaving in the opposite direction, even to the extent of leaving their own comfort zone in that direction. The drive is for the relationship average to be at the desired level, though the complication is that each person may have a different goal.
For a specific example, let's assume one person (A) is an introvert and their partner (B) is an extrovert. If A feels like they're going to too many parties, then s/he may start lobbying for more time at home, or even start deliberately avoiding social events that s/he might otherwise have enjoyed. B might in turn react to this reaction, and be more insistent about going out on principle, rather than for any such intense desire. You can construct many other similar examples, such as one partner becoming more and more effusive in displays of emotion because they feel their partner is distant or unemotional. (And that partner then withdrawing further if it makes them uncomfortable.)
If you want to see this more formulaically, let's take our two people A and B, call the trait T, and the respective comfort points for this trait Z(A,T) and Z(B,T). Then the theory is basically a function that says:
This is, of course, only a rough approximation. Clearly it couldn't strictly be true, because the positive feedback loop it creates would turn each person into a raving maniac at opposite ends of any given spectrum within minutes. So I'd give it at least the following caveats (there may be more):
This applies mainly to traits or issues of relative significance to the relationship. (E.g. your favorite color doesn't count.)
Each person probably has a limit to how far out of their comfort zone they're willing/able to go, even voluntarily.
This probably applies differently at different stages of a relationship. (E.g. not so much in the beginning, when you're all love-crazy.)
But it's the general concept that's most important here, and the potential application of it. The problem with these attempts to maintain balance is that a mathematically balanced relationship is still very unstable if one or both of the individual partners are working at their limits. However, if you're aware of this potential motivation behind your (and your partner's) behavior, then you can take steps to balance things in a more healthy way.
So how do we do that? Unfortunately, I haven't had much direct experience in this part of the theory yet. My instinctual advice would be to start with that all-purpose relationship tool, communication. If you notice this happening, say so. Explain where your comfort zone is, and describe the things that make you uncomfortable and why (being respectful, of course, of the other person's valid choices and preferences). Maybe you'll be able to find the overlap in your zones and then consciously start spending more time there, but maybe it will be more complicated than that. The greater the differences, the more compromises will need to be made.
This last bit may come as a surprise because I do not believe that the ideal balance has two partners lining up conveniently in every way. Rather, I think this theory illuminates something I've wondered about for a long time. That is the tension between two theories of attraction: the "birds of a feather" model vs. "opposites attract." I've observed both of these effects within the same relationship, without fully understanding how they can both contribute to making things work. Now I think I have a better idea.
The "birds of a feather" traits, I believe, should be the ones that correspond to strengths for both people. If you feel that you are already at the best possible state with respect to one trait, then a good match for you will be there as well. You don't want someone who will be pulling you off track. For instance, someone who is very good at expressing love and caring for people would do better with another similar spirit than with an insensitive brute (to take an extreme example).
The "opposites attract" factor will best come into play with those traits that you feel need some work. (I'm assuming here that you have the desire for self-improvement here, and aren't just apathetic about it.) In this case, an "opposite" partner can help pull you in the direction you need/want to go. For instance, the introverts can get more good social interaction by tagging along with their extrovert partners, who can then in turn perhaps learn something about introspection and self-reflection. Of course, in these cases you have to be very careful. If a growth opportunity for one person is a frustrating drag on the other, then there's still going to be difficulty. And even if there is an ideal midpoint for both people, it may take some compromising to get there.
So I might sum this up as: Reinforce your strengths and balance out your weaknesses. Sounds kinda obvious once you get past all the verbose explanation of it, but it can be harder to see when you're actually in the midst of figuring out a relationship. What do you think?
Hmm. Good food for thought. I have definitely seen/experienced the "drive for relationship average" play out in just the way you've described, and I've also definitely experienced the "opposites attract model for growth". I can't quite make them fit together though. It seems that in your "drive for relationship average" idea, an extrovert partying a lot will make an introvert pull back and want even more alone time than before, rather than resulting in a compromise where both are pulled towards the middle.
lol............the dance of the ages. Balance in relationships. Assuming you mean between men and women, which isn't perhaps a fair assumption these days, the " balance " we seek is not easily defined . Love, caring and partnerships require more giving , than seeking one's own needs be met.
To look for a formula that can be used to give humans peace in a relationship would stop wars even. At home and in the larger world. I suspect humans will continue to struggle with balance. Finding it one's self first , then finding someone who wants to share who they are with you as you are...........now that's love. Peace.......http://www.behaviordogtraining.net
WOW, some heavy stuff there in Ideal Balance. I had bookmarked this page to re-read it when I have a little more energy in me.
Very interesting post. I guess I'd just add that another piece in the equation is self-time vs. couple-time. If there seems to be an imbalance in the relationship, the answer MAY be to seek out the balancing experience for yourself. This of course, requires another fine balancing act, making sure that the important needs of the relationship are still nutured. And of course that the experience isn't directly detrimental to the relationship. Don't ask me to try and fit THAT into a mathematical equation!
intense subject to mull over, thanks for posting. this reminds me of a rough nite with the mock turtle i once had, and other push-me pull-you dancers i have known! i get a real kick out of the word relationship; subtract the ‘r’ from that and you get elationship, a little closer to what we all are looking for, in my case the closest i ever got to any relationships was yet another letter's deduction from the word making “elationhips,” proud of it! a nice respite from other derivatives such as: the dumper ship, the partner ship, must i go on?
Despite my slow commenting, this has been bouncing around in my head since I read it. I think "reinforce your strengths and balance out your weaknesses" is dead-on, as advice goes.
As for what really happens, though, I don't think that person A and person B move away from each other to the far-opposite ends of their comfort zones most of the time. I think more often they try to move toward each other, resulting in either a) expanding the comfort zones of one or both partners until there's an overlap or b) that axis simply becomes "outside the relationship" as the partners give up on that particular alignment. Option b isn't a bad thing since it ends the pulling and tugging -- but it can't happen on TOO many axes, or the relationship won't have enough to hold it together.
Extrovert/introvert is an axis on which it's very hard to give up, it should be said, since it's really hard for couples to have separate social lives. Maybe that's a good one to line up on. That and whether each person wants children.
Eightoclock - I think that's a good point, and merits an amendment to the theory. I think what you describe about moving closer together is probably something more likely to happen in the earlier stages of the process, when the whole relationship is being defined from the ground up anyway. If the middle ground exists and works for both people, then this whole issue is taken care of automatically. However, if it's too much of a stretch for someone, then at some point they'll be unable to keep it up and react in the opposite direction, which is when my theory comes more explicitly into play. (And I first came up with this description of it all after having reached such a breaking point, so I guess I had sort of assumed that context but not made it clear.)
Bigg - I think you're correct, but everything you do as an individual still affects the relationship that you're a part of. E.g. back to our classic example, the introvert may stay home because he needs some quiet time for himself, but the extrovert partner may still be sad that she has to go to the party alone.
it is refreshing to hear a guy's perspective on such matters. i like the fact that you recognize communication as being an important negotiating tactic in achieving balance. i liked the fact you could elegantly explain some relationship dynamics in mathematical terms. i find your balance theory quite similar to the physiological mechanism of homeostatis and the processes the body initiates in order to maintain equilibrium.
Quote from academic paper "Ecological, biological, and social systems are homeostatic. They oppose change with every means at their disposal. If the system does not succeed in reestablishing its equilibriums, it enters into another mode of behavior, one with constraints often more severe than the previous ones. This mode can lead to the destruction of the system if the disturbances persist." this quote could very easily apply to relationships - and explain why people cling to destructive relationships. the desire to avoid change (a break up) is so great that people continue to mobilize efforts to work at a relationship or employ the fail safe tactics of denial or complete honesty and disclosure depending on persons involved. it also explains why people avoid relationships in the first place.
Hi there - What a great post! “reinforce your strengths and balance out your weaknesses”...that's where I've been going wrong all along!

Due to ongoing problems I've been having with Google Apps for Business, I have been unable to log into Blogger for ages. Even though it is now mid-January, I'm going to reflect on 2012, as I like to look back over a year and work out what it meant to me and recognise the defining moments throughout it.
January actually changed a lot of things for me. I was in a minor car accident and although this didn't directly have an impact on my life (just my poor car!), the events that panned out in the following hours/days - and the circumstances that evolved from the whole situation - altered the way I look at a lot of things.
One of the positive things to come from the turbulence was that I moved Little Riot into its first office - the collaborative Ignite100 loft in Newcastle. I couldn't have asked for a cooler place, or a better bunch of people to work with. And the good news is, if you fancy it, you can come too.
Well into my burst of Business-related productivity by February, I was lucky enough to be asked to go along to Entrepreneur Week in Athens, Greece. I was part of a delegation along with five other young entrepreneurs, several of whom have become good friends.
In March I won "Best Start Up" in the Scottish category of the Lloyds TSB Enterprise Awards. I had a very exciting day in Edinburgh where I pitched to a panel of judges, followed by a swanky lunch at my very own Little Riot table.
A few weeks later, I attended the grand final in Liverpool, during the Global Entrepreneurship Congress. I pitched to a pretty cool bunch of people and wore a really epic dress to the black tie dinner, thanks to Coast :)
In April I continued to work really hard and also visited John in Dubai. Working hard was a lot easier with a cracking view of Dubai Marina! I had brunch in the Burj Al Arab, which was incredible.
May was a cracking month for press. It started with a double page spread in Scottish newspaper The Courier... and ended up with a mention in Marie Claire magazine, in between a dildo and a sex chair. Sorry, mum.
Looking back now, all I did in June and July was work flat out. It was a critical time for the company and I gave 110% and then some to make sure everything worked out. The highlight of these months was one rare afternoon when I managed to get out in the sunshine and ride my horse :-)
At the start of August I went to the Olympics, after being lucky enough to win tickets at the Lloyds TSB Enterprise Awards earlier in the year. It was really cool to be part of something so huge and Lloyds spoiled me as a guest.
I also closed a pretty big business deal which has changed my life, business and personal, in both good ways and bad.
At the start of September I visited three cities in Germany as part of a creative business exchange. Myself and Olivia from Blue Iris Films were shown round various agencies, businesses and organisations. The highlight for me was visiting the Red Dot Design Museum.
I turned 25 on day three. Half way to fifty, gulp. Spent the day judging the Shell LiveWIRE Awards and then had a nice, albeit bizarre, night out with people from the office.
Had a great day in London thanks to Lloyds TSB and their ongoing support of the winners from their Enterprise Awards. It culminated with drinks in the Houses of Parliament. Lovely wine, I can see where my tax is going ;-)
I was a finalist the the Woman of the Future Awards and got to met Dame Kelly Holmes and James Caan. Little Riot was also listed in the Real Business/Wonga 'Future 50'.
This month was busybusy and then I was wiped out by the flu in the run up to Christmas which was fairly inconvenient! December was the month I finally got to know this year's cohort of Ignite100 teams, which I wish I'd done sooner.
All in all, 2012 was a fairly positive year. A few ups and downs - as with everything - but I'll definitely always look back on it as a good one, overall. Here's hoping 2013 will continue in a similar way!

Getting tired of the smoky idle and a puff at shift changes so I think it's time for new seals. Anyone have any recommendations. I really don't have the time to deal with it in my driveway so I'll have the shop handle it.
I'm still running Andy's heads from early 2011. Pretty much always had a little smoke at startup but a little more persistent these days.
Viton seal work well.... Not sure how many miles on them but maybe while you have them off maybe replace springs and get a valve job..
CIB members discuss innovative ways to improve their capacity building programmes | CIB Working Group
How can we measure our progress on the SDGs in a coherent manner? What are the do’s and don’ts when evaluating local government development cooperation programmes? How can we raise further awareness for Agenda 2030 and the New Urban Agenda among local and regional governments? These issues and many more were tackled at the 12th annual CIB meeting last week, which was held in Stockholm, at the premises of the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, with further support of SKL International and the Swedish International Centre for Local Democracy (ICLD).
Based on the evaluation of last year, this year’s meeting included a full day on the Sustainable Development Goals. UCLG presented findings from its report which will be presented at the High Level Political Forum (HLPF) in New York in July. The report was based on 101 responses from 61 different countries; 28 of which are reporting to the 2018 HLPF. Local Government Associations (LGAs) played an important role in the reporting process: they were responsible for 54 of the responses. Since last year, the localization movement has spread to almost all the regions of the world. Despite these trends, outreach is still limited to a group of advanced cities and associations.
CIB members discussed how to prepare national delegations to the HLPF, how to assist partner LGAs in the implementation of and reporting on the SDGs in the next year and how to align the different systems to monitor the progress on the SDGs. Different members proposed to set-up a taskforce on SDG indicators in the next months; the CIB secretariat will discuss with UCLG how to follow up on this.
While many CIB members are occupied with the SDGs in one way or another, a range of other topics were also discussed in Stockholm. Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning remains a priority for all members. Expert Corina Dhaene shared findings on an analysis of 12 evaluation reports of CIB member organizations and advised on how to organize external evaluations effectively. The New Urban Agenda and sustainable urban development are also high on the agenda at many organizations, often combined with climate issues. In Canada and Flanders, national governments are placing more and more focus on gender in the local government sphere – this has impacted the international programmes.
This year’s CIB meeting took place in Stockholm, hosted by the three associations SALAR, ICLD and SKL International. Sweden’s remarkable attention for local government development globally was amongst others topic of a panel in which the Swedish International Development Agency explained the reason behind their good relation with the associations in international cooperation.

I by far am not the manliest of fellas. I think an Amaretto Sour is a fine drink and have learned to stomach Project Runway. Tim Gunns tough but fair. I also love Peggy Lee and don’t just watch “Orange Is The New Black” for the shower scenes. I really enjoy the character developments and Uzo Aduba “Crazy Eyes” is a brilliant actress.
All to say I don’t wear my testicles like little tributes of honor on my shoulders. Didn’t man-purses go away in the 80′s? I blame the European Union on this one. I have no basis for this accusation but economic unrest can lead to unforseen consequences. What honestly is wrong with the strapless wallet? Money clips are pretty bad-ass. I can’t even pawn this one off on the metro-sexuals. It’s bigger than them. The gentlemen that have carried them in (and thankfully out) of service have been totally cool, but what decent God-fearing American would accessorize them with their Lees?
It’s the sexiest grupo on the planet, just ask them. I’ve never heard anyone talk with as much passion about a set of hubs as a Campy person. People dig Shimano components and appreciate SRAM but rarely talk orgasmically over them. Campys love-affair with itself makes is totally incompatible with any other component group. Its sorta like a pretty young lady rocking a 3.9 g.p.a. with no identifiable social skills. Exceptionally functional but a bore at mixers. To be fair every company worth its weight in ceramic bearings has a superiority complex. It’s healthy for business. Campagnolo has thought differently for years and in doing so has made some of the best components mechanickind has ever had to never hear the end of.
We see all types of bikes everyday from the luxurious to the practical. Every customer presents their own unique challenge. Every customer has a story and not always an audience to recieve it. In service the doctor is always in and the fee for unsolicited unqualified advice is always free.
I get stories about divorce, death of children, births of children, lifestyle changes, accomplishments, failures and all in the spate of writing up a job order for a flat change. Sometimes you want to give said person a hug and other times just a quote and a time of expectation. You cannot escape the human experience in the bike store and especially not in service. The alcohol in house is generally reserved for employee use only, but some days you just want to clear a space on the counter pass a guy a bottle and a shot glass and just keep the tab open. Understanding the human mind really isn’t my shtick but 44 years has taught me that in most cases we’re all just as lost as the next guy, but perspective like decent beer is everything.

So I’m a UX designer. “UX” stands for User Experience and means that it’s my job to make it as easy as possible for users of products to accomplish their tasks. When us UX guys and gals are feeling touchy-feely we create what are called ‘user stories’ where we follow a user from the beginning of a path to their goal and identify friction points and fix them. We are the champions of the end user.
I recently purchased a Garmin Edge 1000, primarily for the LiveTrack and SMS capabilities. Previously I had been using the RoadID e-Crumb app to let my wife follow my rides and get updates on my whereabouts. The concept is sound but the execution is tragically flawed–the app frequently freezes or fails to update making it look like I’m dead on the road. With my phone packed in my pockets with tons of gear I often miss her text message asking if I’m ok.
The Garmin seemed to promise the solution to both problems: more solid tracking and the ability to see incoming text messages if my tracker did fail for some reason.
The reality is that the onboarding is very, very bad and once configured, the remainder of the experience leaves a little too much room for improvement for a $500 bike computer.
In an effort to look chipper and on top of things @Garmin responded to an admittedly cryptic tweet of mine inviting me to contact their customer support. Of course this is an issue for their customer support but it is also an excellent lesson on exactly what kind of setup experience you want to avoid, so I’m posting it here.
This user story is a slightly abbreviated version of my first actual attempt to set up and use LiveTrack on a ride with my wife as the at-home follower.
In order to set up text message notification I needed to pair my Edge 1000 with my iPhone in the bluetooth settings. Pairing required two connections as if my Garmin were two devices. Jeckyl identified himself as ‘BLE_Edge 1000′ and Hyde was BT_Edge 1000′. Or maybe that’s the other way around. Either way, with the devices paired, alerts on, and Garmin Connect running, text messages were not being passed through from the phone to the Garmin. Online forums provided no clues but suggested that this might be a software-version-incompatibility problem, or that this function was simply broken. You never know with online forums.
With my phone linked to my Edge I fired up the Garmin Connect app on my phone and started a LiveTrack session. As part of the setup I needed to invite a contact. Apple’s search filter works great within address book and narrows down the list as you type but here Garmin seemed to have written their own, much worse version. The results you see apparently only match the first letter you typed, and none thereafter.
None of the names shown first on my list matched the letter pattern I typed. Since I’m on a first-name basis with my wife and my friends, and because Apple’s built-in address book sorts by first name, I expect that this will work in the same way.
After finding my wife I obviously choose her SMS number because I wanted her to receive my message right away.
So I had to resend the invite to a real email address AND send a separate text to my wife telling her to check her email manually. She doesn’t see it. The message went to her the Junk folder:
She taps the link and is taken to a web page containing a map and some data. The tracker doesn’t seem to update, even though there have been methods to refresh web pages available for a decade.
There are also aspects of the display that are a little confusing such as the minus before the time and distance. Am I traveling back in time? Do I have 35 miles left to ride?
When thinking about what your viewer may want, elevation gain probably isn’t on the top of their list. More useful would be defaulting to a ‘current’ speed–this way the follower knows if you’ve stopped and if you don’t start moving again within a certain time period they can legitimately start wondering about you.
So my wife sees the screen above and wonders what’s up and sends me a text message asking if everything is ok. My phone gets it quietly but does not register on my Garmin because something failed in the pairing of the devices and instead of producing and error or warning, it gave a confirmation that all was well.
I’m done! After finishing and saving the ride Garmin Connect sends no additional email or text to her so the only way she knows I’m really done and alive is:
Improve error detection so that if a bluetooth connection has a problem that will prevent a text message from getting passed from phone to edge that the user is notified
Postscript: After this first ride I gave the bluetooth pairing another go and deleted all connections and re-added them, with the BLE_Edge 1000 first, after which text messages started showing up on the Edge. As and end user don’t know if this order is important or if it was just luck of the draw that it worked.
Accidental or possibly purposeful, racism happens in the last bastion of all that is pure and decent; the bike shop. Sometimes I don’t think people really take into consideration just what in the hell they are saying. I’m not the Sesitivity Inspector as I failed my civil servants exam but, I think I know foul shit when I hear it. When someone had used that term as part of a poorly slung together anecdote about who she was and who she wasn’t I paused and waited for something from her to expound on her words. I really believe she thought she was using a term that was not offensive like, “fag” or “chink” or Afro-American. Some moments are teaching moments and others are made for Michelob.
Service folks are not cynics by trade but by design. Bikes fatigue just like everything in the known universe. They fatigue even faster if you happen to get hit by a truck. In service our responsibility is to inspect the bikes for anything that could cause future heartache and certain regret.
Step 1 in this dance, is to ask about the health of the one fortunate enough to find time to ride, only to cash in those chips by doing “the bump” with a Chevy. Sometimes you see the person still clearly fucked up trying to address the shifting issues there bike was having pre-wreck. Gotta love (from a distance) the vigor.
Step 2 is seperating the cosmetic damage from a piece destined for a shop art piece. Not every shop has a Jackson Pollack hanging but most will have some sort of homage to a dead bike.
Step 3 is cleaning the frame and inspecting it for telltale signs of damage like missing chain stays. That’s usually a dead giveaway that the bike is beyond repair.
Step 4 is putting your arm around the client’s good shoulder and giving it to them straight. Eye contact is crucial. As their bike is suspended on the gurney lifeless and cold, the way in which you deliver the news is vital to the next step…
Step 5 is the estimate. You usually don’t want to lead with, “I know a guy______”. That works in Jersey and the un-gentrified sections of NYC but sounds like a crock of shit in every other part of the country. Carbon repair is costly but there are avenues that cater to the super metal-type substance. Usually with the steel bikes we see, the fabrication outweighs the cost of the bike. The carbon repair estimate pill for the customer can be harder to swallow than the oxy that they refuse to share, but still cheaper than going new.
I had a customer tell me that she would come over to get her bike as soon as something she had in the oven was done cooking. I really didn’t need to know why she couldn’t come now, but its the quirky people that make life tolerable. When her pie did finish she came over. Empty handed too. Pie almost beats a case of beer for mechanics. You bring pie and you have mechanical friends for life. She did tell me about the network of chicken farmers in town. Again, I don’t know why, but I love a quirky yarn. I think chicken raising may be what hiptsers evolve to after drinking artisan Pabst, skinny jeans and Italian fixed gears are all passe’. Someone will no doubt raise the stakes and have an in town cow named Mabel. Fuck hipsters and their fresh milk!!

They are evil. Not like Hitler, but if the two were spoken of in the same sentence I wouldn’t be surprised.
I was talking to a woman the other day and in our conversation she used the acronym, “E.O.D.” (end of day) when I explained that we couldn’t do the service on the spot but would complete it by close. I had no idea what in the fuck she was talking about. I think my expression relayed that. She peeped the grays in my stubble and dumbed it up for me. Unless your hitting two packs of smokes a day, you can spare the breath it would have taken you to complete your sentence. And yes…Get off my lawn!!!
Why are you using code in casual conversation anyway? I don’t think the Russians give two shits about when your bike is going to be serviced unless your riding for Teams Katusha or Astana.
A guy came in from Israel to have his bike assembled. No problem. I took it out of the box to be welcomed by Israeli dirt. The last road this bike may traveled may have been one lf biblical importance. Not too many of those roads in the USA. River Road that runs alongside the Passaic River may be as close as it gets for Jersey. No prophets that I’m aware of floated down those mighty waters, but in Paterson anything’s possible.
As I was giving the bike a good wipe down the grandeur of holy dirt faded. Holy dirt is as much a pain in the ass as the secular stuff. Maybe even moreso. The consistency was clay-like. After applying the holy trinity of bike detailing which is, Simple Green, Bike Luster and a shop rag I took it out of my stand and moved on to a less sanctified machine.
Shops closed. We have specified times of operation like 100% of the business in this country. Just because the doors not locked doesn’t mean the times on the door are bogus.
I’m a people person between the hours of 9 and 5. Something weird happens at 5:01. My warm and fuzzies get a little cold and prickly. We rarely turn people away in service at close, but when we do it’s done with a republican look of abject remorse.
A gentleman comes through our doors drenched in sweat. Not moved by his Herculean efforts to still fall short. He tells me that he just snuck in and then smiles as though I’m supposed to follow with a hi-five or Muslim terrorist fist bump made popular by our president. Stuff happens and people call ahead. We try to be accommodating. Don’t kill yourself or others trying to make it by close for a brake job on your Emonda. Its all about communications and preferably libations. If you have a tri-bike I totally understand your need to improve on your splits in every facet of your life. “It’s a tri-thing, you wouldn’t understand.”
The most awesome thing about biking is just how many people regardless of level of brokenness still have an opportunity to enjoy the sport. The filthy rich shop with us, as do the plain ol’ filthy. It’s all good.
I was helping out a gentleman the other day who looked like the kind of fella that never leaves the house without at least 2 g’s in his Vucana wool lined pockets. That said his tires pop just as easily as mine do. The cycling gods don’t give two fucks about who you are or who you think you may be. He tells me that he’s off on his way to the Hamptons and he needs a few tubes just in case. He became a whole lot less snooty. He was prepared to roll up the sleeves on his Givenchy to do a flat repair. Self made man possibly? I don’t know, but the conversation steered its way towards alcohol with me sitting in the captain’s chair.
I tell him that a beer is in my future. He shares with me that he was never a beer guy and that wine was more his fare. More beer for me more wine for him.
It’s customary to offer to carry out a customers bike. It’s chivalrous in some cases and in other cases quite useless.
A woman comes in to purchase a bike. Someone else has down the heavy lifting of finding her ideal new partner. I help set her saddle and congratulate her on her purchase. As she is preparing to leave her partner walks in the door. His shoulders clear the door frame but not by much. His muscles weighed more than me. The Crusher!!!! Some people live for the gym and others live in it. I’m sure in that gym on the walls hung a sign that stated, “Cardio is Fags” or “Get Ripped or Get Lost”
I offer stupidly and out of habit to bring her bike out to their car. He looks back at me muscles glistening and shit and tells me that he’s got this. I don’t even bother to hold in my gut.
A lot of shit has changed over time. It’s totally acceptable for gangsters to wear skinny jeans, a cup of coffee to cost $3.00 and biblical movies to be trendy. Side Note: I think its fucking awesome that studios need big name stars to sell movies about biblical happenings. It’s the bible! The star power is in the book.
I had sold a guy on a rack for his car. The deal wasn’t complete to him until we shook on it. Sounds good. A nice throwback. Our first flesh-press was firm but not the kind this magnate was accustomed to. He asked for a do-over. I obliged. We took all of one anothers hands and strongly shook them. He made a man of me. The only thing we neglected to do was spit in our hands first. In another time without the saliva the agreement would not have been ironclad. Different times indeed…
I was riding today. Its hot as this is Jersey in July. You see a lotta stuff when your rambling through the different townships. Tiny little slices of America.
One gentleman caught my eye. Average schlubby white guy. I pass by dozens on any given day. When I’m riding and my chamois isn’t quite fitting right, my senses divert my attention from the imminent saddles sores and onto whatever else outwardly has value. When those seams find a weakness, no crotch is safe.
The guy in question was mowing his lawn. Nothing strange there. I looked at his face and saw that he was puffing on a cigar while doing his chore. I’ve seen this before but never really thought too much of it. Guys doing chores with cigars in tow. Ok…What was he trying to convey? He is still a force to be reckoned with? I’m a rebel with or without my Toro?
Regardless of reason, my ass still hurts and is now in intensive care, the guys lawn is mowed and everyone in the neighborhood knows that his lawn was mowed but on his terms…
I was getting ready to leave work and decided that I needed a few supplements for a training ride in the morning. I thumbed through all of the usual suspects: powerbar gels, hammer gels and cliff bar shot blocks. Crack for athletes. Amphetamines got a nasty reputation from half the inductees in the Baseball Hall of Fame, so selling it on our shelves is a no-no. Also bad aftertaste. Shout out to Pete Rose. Let him in!
Gu gels had a flavor that caught my eye, “chocolate outrage”. I wondered for a second if this were marketed towards black endurance athletes or if it were merely a clueless execs attempt at wordplay? Maybe Chocolate Outrage was a hero in DC Comics, “Justice League” that died in Mississippi on his first day on the job from a gamma ray infused noose? Our consolation was Black Vulcan, a friendly sort of subjugated hero that looked like pre-shit going down, OJ Simpson.
How do you mix economic depravity, racism, police abuse, exploitation at-large, etc… and get it in one tiny little foil packet? It doesn’t even sound appeasing to the palate.
That’s almost as bad as a flavor called, Vanilla Power; “superior energy that will last a thousand years, metaphorically speaking of course”. I wish these companies would run their ideas past a more diverse board of marketeers. Maybe “chocolate outrage” would have drawn a flag. Maybe it did and the company looked at their core base and said, “fuck it, blacks make up 2% of our sales anyway”. I doubt it went down like that, by why even give that quandary a breath of life?
My neighbor pulls me aside last night to talk to me. I had no clue as to what he wanted to share, but the look on his face was concerning. I steadied myself for whatever was coming next be it family, house, work, etc…. I was kicking myself for not having had that pint before going outside. In dramatic fashion he told me that the drive train on his mountain bike was skipping. It was really bothering him and sapping his performance. I’m looking at him bewildered. It’s 8pm and not only am I off the clock, but completely sober. I give my probable diagnosis and as quickly as he had gotten my attention he was gone into the night.
You won’t be putting on the regular miles that you do while the weather is warm so your baseline will be lower
You’ll be riding with the extra weight of perspiration and/or precipitation soaked into all of that extra winter gear
Speaking of which, I would recommend choosing shorter routes so that you aren’t tempted to stop for hot chocolate once you’re out. Once soggy you finally gets moving into that cold, winter wind you will immediately regret it, followed by getting hypothermia and dying. Happy riding!
Maybe you paid for the ride in advance. Maybe it just so happens that mother nature decides to dump on your one window of opportunity to ride all week. Whatever, it’s 40 and raining and you’re going to get on that horse and ride it. Here is what I wear in these conditions:
Since you will be using a good outer shell or two you can go a little light on the base layers. I choose a heavy (though not fleece lined) long-sleeved Under Armor shirt and a regular short sleeved jersey. Should the clouds break you’ll appreciate being able to let your arms breathe a little if you remove your outer jacket.
When its cold enough that its almost snowing you don’t need to bother with gore-tex or anything super high-zoot, but you should consider something cycling-specific. The Capo pictured has a little ventilation under the arms, has an extended back side and most importantly, is clear so your club kit shows through!
Even when wet your leg muscles are going to generate plenty of heat. Rainproof pants will be too much for a training ride–stick with two layers of good lycra and you’ll be fine. Avoid thicker fleece as that will just soak up water.
I probably shouldn’t have grouped these together but I did. Here is the bottom line: Unless you have rain-specific gore-tex-lined shoes you’re going to get wet so you might as well prepare for it. The Perl Izumi Barrier Pro shoe covers pictured lasted about 50 minutes in a steady drizzle before I could feel that the dampness was more rain than sweat, which brings me to the second point:
Use the right weight of WOOL sock. Too light and you’ll get cold. Too heavy and your feet will feel like they are wringing out sponges with every pedal stroke. You just want a little light insulation. Wool, as you know, will keep you warm even when wet.
Following the same theme as the shoes you should also know that your hands are going to get wet as well. Bummer. Lucky for you they can remain comfortable. I have an entire writeup on the use of cold water diving gloves for cycling use. They’re pretty good and really the only thing that will work. I just took these babies out for 2.5 hours of non-stop rain and only had wrinkly fingertips as a result.
I like using a cycling cap in the rain as it helps to keep the rain out of my eyes. Glasses are utterly useless so I leave those at home.
PRO TIP: DRY OUT YOUR SHOES QUICKLY UPON RETURNING. Use a space heater or a hair dryer. Once you start growing stuff in your shoes you will NEVER get the smell out. Believe me. The shoes pictured have been washed, bleached, soaked in baking soda, and more. The faint smell of wrong still lingers.
New for the entire ChestVest and FannyPack line is the 3 In-One addition of a full velcro loop front pocket allowing for:
The choice is yours. As in the past, the ChestVests lighten your load and simplifies your fishing at the best value in fishing packs today. Your hands are free from holding your rod and fly box while you tie on the next fly or lure. Tools are held securely by internal retractors. ChestVests are more universal, comfortable and cooler to wear than most vests and are made of rugged RIP-STOP 600 denier fabric and nylon webbing. Packs indicated as Saltwater Designed use non-corrosive nylon zipper glides.
However, no longer many scholars take this chance to its complete power, commonly simply because they don´t recognize what's the function in their schooling and consequently haven't outlined guidance to lead their judgements on their academic paths. From this desire, we introduce during this e-book Seven ideas to facilitate the definition of private academic reasons to steer the improvement of academic trajectories of students.
This is a booklet aimed essentially for college students, but additionally for folks and execs who're attracted to guiding scholars within the definition in their lifestyles projects.

// Error: line 1: Plug-in, "AnimSchoolPicker" was compiled against too old a version of the Maya API and is thus incompatible with the current Maya version. (AnimSchoolPicker). Is there a version for Maya 2016.5? The Autoload is checked, but I don't know what that means.
It means the plugin isn't compatible with that version of Maya. The API changes on occasion, so plugins must be compiled with the Maya version intended for use (in this case it's compiled for 2016, but not 2016.5).
I noticed that in this version I do not see the control name when I hover over buttons, hopefully that feature can be restored.
Yes it is working the issue was a Maya setting. You just need to enable display Tool Clips in mayas preferences in order to see them. Previous versions of Maya had this on by default.
// Error: line 1: Plug-in, "AnimSchoolPicker" was compiled against too old a version of the Maya API and is thus incompatible with the current Maya version. (AnimSchoolPicker).
I was prompted to download the picker again and initially tried copying the AnimSchoolPicker.mll file over my existing .mll in my scripts directory, but this didn't work. I tried reinstalling and deleting Maya prefs and reinstalling. Still not having any success. Is this possibly an issue with the wrong version being in the 2016.5 folder in the .zip file I downloaded?
My guided ‘season’ hasn’t much longer to run at this stage, and in fact many days have been ‘put back’ and left open until 2014, but bass fishing possibilities for the interested angler can remain good up to Christmas time and who knows what may happen?
I have been very busy over the past year and even busier since the beginning of September now that the final year of my tourism development BSc degree has kicked into place. This is probably reflected in the lack of text posts on the website during 2013, time is scarce and valuable!
Both of this years semesters deal with creating authentic, empathetic, genuine and influential experiences for and with customers, in fact authentic experiences seem to be emphasised throughout the syllabus and combining these strategies with a strong local network base is the basis of the final submission. This final submission will close the last year and indeed the BSc degree program in April 2014. Where has the time gone?
At times I think I may be a bit mad but later this week I will also hope to complete the Leave No Trace advanced trainer course. I have been waiting three years to be part of this opportunity and it falls nicely (even if at an extremely busy time) into how I want to develop the business into the future. This is probably the first time that leave no trace principles will be carried into an angling / coastal ethos and it will be an interesting and challenging few days for the group and myself.
Leave No Trace Ireland is a network of organisations and individuals with an interest in promoting the responsible recreational use of the outdoors. As increasing numbers of people seek the beauty and exhilaration of outdoor recreation, our collective mark on the environment and its natural processes, increases. Litter, disturbance to vegetation, water pollution, wildlife, livestock and other people are all indicators of the need to develop a national ethic that protects both natural and cultural heritage. Techniques designed to minimise the social and environmental impacts to these areas are incorporated into the Leave No Trace Outdoor Ethics Education Programme as seven Principles.
I hope to carry those seven principles into my guided angling services and into the future of SEAi. Guiding is a lot more than simply bringing people fishing it should be an experience and with the LNT principles I’m sure I can enhance that experience into the future. I will also be able to deliver and teach Leave No Trace short Programs. Worth considering too are the angling principles of the FFF seen here.
Ireland's countryside and marine environment is undoubtedly a high quality natural resource, both spatially extensive and diverse in nature. The extensiveness and diversity of the resource base lends itself to the provision of opportunities for a wide range of countryside and marine based recreation activities for both the local population and for an increasing number of tourists.
As pressure on our landscapes and seascapes from recreational use continues to increase, it is necessary that a national system is put in place which will ensure that visitors to the Irish countryside, whether locals or tourists, visit with care.
Working with some European journalists to develop that tourism potential of our seascapes in the past few months has proven both challenging and interesting. With a changed fishery that is more demanding than ever, at times it proved to be very difficult, in fact most of the season it remained as tough as I have ever experienced it.
The latest edition of Voyages De Peches (see above left) includes an article of our experiences on the South Eastern coastline this summer including locations from Waterford Wexford and Cork, what a week that was! Hopefully it can only serve to assist all of us engaged in the Irish angling tourism business!
I received a present of the flies above on Thursday from David Gaudochon. Not only are they Jack Gartside patterns but they have been tied by Jack Gartside himself. David and I spoke at length of the relationship between the spirit that is inherent in something made by a tier that you connect with and then consequently how you fish with a feeling that is like nothing else. Both Brian and Andy do this for me.
Jack Gartside is counted as one the most innovative and prolifically inventive fly tyers of the modern era. He got his first fly tying lesson in 1956 from Ted Williams, the great Boston Red Sox outfielder. That served as the beginning of a professional tying and angling career that spanned more than 50 years. Jack was one of the first fly tyers profiled in Sports Illustrated magazine (Oct. 12, 1982). His best-known original patterns include the Gurgler, the Sparrow, the Soft Hackle Streamer, and the Gartside Pheasant Hopper. His designs have been featured in Eric Leiser'sBook of Fly Patterns, Judith Dunham's The Art of the Trout Fly, Lefty Kreh's Salt Water Fly Patterns, Dick Stewart's Salt Water Flies, and Dick Brown's Flyfishing for Bonefish.
Sadly, Jack died in December 2009. In 2010 he was selected into the Fly Fishing Hall of Fame. It was a long-standing desire of his that his work and this web site continue to be available after he was gone. And so it is.
Jack is the author of Striper Flies, the first book ever specifically written on fly patterns for striped bass. Another book, Striper Strategies, was described by reviewer Steve Raymond as: "...one of the most remarkable striper-fishing manuals to see the light of day," and by reviewer Tom Meade as "Blessed with bright writing, keen observations, and the most concise advice a striper hunter can find."
Just a quick email to say thanks really, now that I have returned and the brain has had time to process all that went on. As ever it was great to have my annual pilgrimage to Wexico, that goes without saying, however its the small things that always gets me.
Firstly, I would like to say thanks for keeping it all going during what was a hectic week for you with the unforeseen circumstances at home. You could have quite easily said to me.....there is a lot going on, would you be happy enough to spend the week at Mrs Nesbitt's. However, you didn't and your perseverance was noted and very much appreciated.
Another thing that made me happy was to see you f ishing now and again, you do a lot of hard work, under difficult circumstances with the fishery in it's current state and possibly take a lot of the verbal drivel from online sources too seriously. It was great for me seeing the bend in that fly rod, the tail hanging out of the striping basket and then my dubious ability with a Nikon camera. It's terrible when the photographer has to encourage the subject to smile! Though I cannot talk as I am just as bad. The pic of me at the …… location is the only pic of me with a fish and a proper deep/happy smile.
It is a testament to your ability what you can do with that feckin fly rod........even with the French collection I was whipped! Imagine......outfishing the client!!!! (JOKING)
The support team! As ever I am always made to feel very welcome at St John's Road and Eileen did a great job looking after me, plenty of coffee and a hot dinner back at base, what more could I ask for.
WillBoB.......You can pass my regards to William for taking me in and like yourself, making me feel so welcome......I hope to fish with him again next year!
What I have learned......I always pick up something new and currently the head is fizzing with ideas.....there is a package en route from Bears Den fly tackle! Watch this space......I am going to create an abomination of a lure!
Finally, as I stood on the Stena ferry on the Monday morning, a heavy heart was felt! There is only one real answer for me to feel totally better again, remove the casualty from his current environment...........look out, i may be living approximately 197km from Wexford in the new year. The sight of that Cork coastline was too much, anyhow, it could be good......just think how many new spots I could find. Then you could bring the fly rod, I'll supply the Lucozade and the jelly sweets and we could chase some shakey headed silver killers!
Some nice fish taken yesterday evening on the Cork coast on the fly in very ‘bassy’ conditions. Again thanks to Alan for the quick photos.
My usual and well established colour blend of lavender and grey with a hint of chartreuse is working very well at the moment. Last evenings fly was a slight variation on this as we have added Marabou to the mix – I can almost fish the fly stationery at times and still expect takes.
Drifting the fly through the current onto a known lie resulted in a gentle yet powerful take that left me in no doubt I was into something special.
Casting ‘upstream’ and mending when possible it was the first time I had fished for some time due to a lot of guiding days – thanks Alan for the opportunity and the rare photos too.
The factor that most affects how an ocean fish feeds is environmental; saltwater angling success depends on a knowledge of the water and of how various gamefish react in that water.
It has been a bit mad here of late. We have just finished trying to make a bass fishing film for French television. I say trying because it’s always going to be an interesting project and the best laid plans evolve and change plus adding the personality of grumpy Jim capricious fish and film producers under pressure it’s a rollercoaster of trial and error. We got what we needed and the Irish coastline from many different aspects looks great, the fishing as always is based in reality.
Oil was laid on the water with the considerable help of David Byrne from IFI (an old stalwart). William my brother who is becoming a great bass fisherman found all the pieces of the jigsaw with straight edges. Philipe and Philipe worked non stop, but none, absolutely none of this would have made any sense if it wasn’t for the person so often on the ground at base camp. I guess there’s a lot I could say about that help, the phone calls, the preparation of food, the changing of arrangements, the listening, and the incessant fishing talk, the bloody boredom!
The post I made below is not so much about the articles as it is about another person on the ground. Patrick Browne works tirelessly at Irish Angler to make the articles and the magazine come alive. There are times no doubt, which are also shared by people who have had similar experiences; when there is a special feeling of seeing your work in print. Patrick brings another dimension to that, a certain empathy for what you are doing that is difficult to explain.
At times I look at Irish Angler and then inevitably draw comparisons to other angling publications. Is any one magazine ‘better’ than any other? I guess it depends what you want from your publication and anyway I always like working as much as possible with Irish business.
The journey continues today and after the past five days it will seem a bit more like normal, another customer arrives in an hour for a week. David Gaudochon is here next weekend with IFI for five days promotion it’s pretty much nonstop on the ground really.....
Four years ago I wrote these 12 articles from an idea by David Dinsmore editor of Irish Angler – what words would I use now if I had to re-write them I wonder? Some I wouldn’t change at all…
‘…..The portrayal of the fishing and the fishing environment must reflect the ‘performance risk’ accurately and fairly to visiting anglers. We all know yes, that at different times bass can be caught with different methods. All anglers have their preferences and the more sporting the method employed the more the weather can impact negatively upon that method.
It will force you into circumstances where you need to ‘angle’ much more creatively and efficiently. By combining the environmental impact and the challenges that the weather creates for lure and especially fly fishing, this fusion of influences must somehow manage to enhance the experience. In other words, it’s not always easy to come to Wexford to catch bass at the drop of a hat. It can take time and effort, patience and depending on circumstances this could be days, weeks or even years. When it’s difficult it’s the smaller decisions, the glimpses of fish in a wave, the perfect cast into a gale, the surface strike in pouring rain –moments of genuine satisfaction that make bass fishing what it is.’
If you had been bass lure fishing from the shore on a regular basis between the years 2000 and 2006 you will have had the experiences to measure and compare those years to the period say between 2007 and 2013 inc.
When David Byrne from IFI first fished with me one morning very early in the millennium I cast an ABU krill three times on 15lb test mono and on the fourth cast I landed a six pound bass, this was not exceptional the fish were simply there – in all of the systems most of the time, right up to the middle of 2007! If you hadn’t fished that early period and lets say you started bass fishing in 2007/2008 you still had a wonderful time over the next few years, the fact is its a remarkable comparison to the previous seven years for anybody who can make it.
I’ve have always held the belief and have had the on ‘the ground experience’, to a large extent, that the weather impact since 2007 including two remarkable winters have had a cumulative impact on the bass fishery. The same point of where we are today is shared on many aspects of the coast by many people, hidden routines and patterns are not obvious to us.
Its not about night time fishing – always expect to catch more bass at night, or slack tide fishing – sometimes fish behave differently and we attribute this to a further cracking of code in the excitement of discovery, or fishing in tight channels when the tide is out, or boat fishing or fishing with soft plastics – these things are always more productive – the fish are not onshore as a general protected population should be, its simple really!
I’m sharing similar experiences with many anglers who fish on the same coast as I do. But speaking to a colleague today who has told me that he has witnessed vast shoals of bass feeding on fry ‘offshore’ all summer fills me with a high degree of hope.
We have a remarkable fish that we don’t fully understand', one that I feel can adjust to patterns in ways we aren’t even aware of. I think they can ‘shut down’ for extended periods and simply wait and whilst the opportunity presents itself they feed, sleep and have sex! Perhaps this remarkable summer has given them an opportunity to ‘bulk’ up on fatty rich food an opportunity that perhaps hasn’t existed for them for quite a while, maybe as much as four or five seasons, why would you run inshore if there was easy pickings offshore and you felt hungry, had done for a while? – I’d like to see a scale sample from a series of fish from next year and look to see the growth patterns!
Mean air temperatures were above average everywhere ranging from 14.4°C at Malin Head to 16.3°C at Shannon Airport. Carlow (Oak Park) had the warmest summer conditions (compared to normal) with a mean temperature of 16.1°C, +1.2°C above its average and its warmest since 2007 (6 years). A small number of stations in the West Southwest and Midlands reported their warmest summer in 10 to 18 years, while most remaining stations had their warmest since 2006/2007. Overall, all three months predominantly were above average except for some parts of the Northwest and West which had below average temperatures in June and August. July had the warmest conditions (compared to average), with differences of +2.5°C or more in parts and with nine stations reporting heat wave (5 consecutive days with maximum temperature over 25°C degrees) conditions from the 7th to the 13th. Many stations reported it as their warmest July on record. All available seasonal highest maximum temperatures were recorded in July with the season’s highest maximum (available so far) was 31.0°C recorded at Dooks, Co. Kerry (climate station) on the 19th, its highest July and summer maximum since 2006 (7 years). Fermoy (Moore Park) recorded a highest maximum of 28.9°C on July 10th, its highest for summer since 1989 (24 years). Most other stations across the country reported their summer maxima as their highest in seven to 18 years. Summer lowest minimum temperatures were all recorded in June, with Mountdillon reporting lowest temperature of 2.8°C on June 5th.
Rainfall was below average at all stations except for a few isolated stations in the South and Southwest. The lowest rainfall total and percentage of Long-Term Average (LTA) was at Johnstown Castle, with 130.5 mm and 57%?of its LTA, its driest summer since 2000 (13 years).The low summer values at the site were partially attributed to drought conditions (15 consecutive days or more with 0.2 mm rainfall or less) experienced at the station between the 4th and 20th of July. The highest summer rainfall total was at Valentia Observatory with 317.2 mm and 103% of its LTA, reporting nearly 50% more than its average in June and its wettest June since 2007 (6 years). The majority of stations had their driest summer in seven years. The highest daily fall of summer (wettest day) from data available so far was 62.5 mm at Ballincurrig (Peafield), Co. Cork on July 24th/25th, its highest summer rainfall since 2005 (8 years).
Sunshine totals were all above average everywhere, with percentage of LTA values ranging from 101% at Valentia Observatory to 120% at Cork Airport. June and July reported sunny conditions everywhere with dull conditions dominating in August. Cork Airport reported the highest summer sunshine hours with 603.1 hours, 265 hours recorded in July, the highest amount of sunshine ever recorded for any given month since the station opened in 1962 (51 years). Knock Airport reported 475.2 hours of sunshine, its sunniest summer in 16 years. The sunniest days this summer were mostly recorded at the beginning of June with Cork Airport measuring the sunniest day (from available data) on June 4th and 7th with 15.8 hours. Belmullet shared the second highest summer daily sunshine amount with Knock Airport with 15.7 hours, Belmullet’s highest since the summer of 1995 (18 years).
The maximum sea surface temperature of 20.0°C recorded at the M4 and M5 on July 17th and 26th, respectively, were the highest ever recorded in Irish waters.
The Poulter Index is a method of rating the summer weather (June to August), using a formula based on mean temperature, rainfall and sunshine for selected stations, i.e. the higher the index, the 'better' the summer weather.
This year the index was above average and it is considered to be the best summer since 2006 (7 years).
The fish will be back in late September / October to some extent in greater numbers than they have been (not difficult) (1 > 0) and all will be forgotten by November - until 2014!
One hallmark of Wexner Center jazz programming is introducing artists to Columbus by degree. I can’t imagine anyone at the Wex for Mary Halvorson’s Quintet in 2012 forgot the dynamic trumpeter Jonathan Finlayson. I heard similar awe-struck noises from audiences lucky enough to see him with Steve Lehman’s Octet last year. To close 2017, Finlayson returns with finely honed compositions and a cracking band of rising stars.
Like many of the last three generations of artists at the vanguard of jazz, Finlayson apprenticed with the great Steve Coleman and Five Elements. His music, while not sounding much like Coleman’s, carries with it the same intense curiosity and hunger for the world. His most recent album with Sicilian Defense, Moving Still, made top 10 lists for both Nate Chinen of the New York Times (who also ranked Mary Halvorson’s Octet featuring Finlayson as his record of the year) and Dave Sumner’s taste-making blog Bird is the Worm. Chinen said, “Mr. Finlayson is an improvising trumpeter almost never caught off balance, and on this album he applies that poise to compositions inspired by the poetry of the chessboard.” Sumner waxed rhapsodic about “A series of captivating moments that seem to go on forever and then end too soon.”
The quintet features guitarist Miles Okazaki, fellow Pi Records artist and Coleman alum. Okazaki has worked with everyone from John Zorn to Jane Monheit, from Donny McCaslin to Amir El-Saffar. As a leader, Okazaki’s 2017 record Trickster is already garnering just best-of-year praise. Adaptable to every situation, Okazaki brings an unmistakable tone and center of gravity to everything he plays.
Pianist David Bryant sets bandstands on fire with artists like Jen Shyu, Roy Haynes, and Eric McPherson. His thick rhythm and relaxed slide between melodic invention is a modern sound that feels connected but not beholden to the past. Bassist Chris Tordini swings hard through fascinating abstractions with everyone from Chris Speed to Kris Davis to Tyshawn Sorey. Drummer Craig Weinrib got my attention on Henry Threadgill’s masterpiece of a record Double Up and kept that grip on my throat through Finlayson’s Moving Still.
There hasn’t been a weak jazz show at the Wexner all 2017 and this promises to continue the exceptional trend. Don’t miss the chance to sink into the thorny earworms of Finlayson’s compositions and lose yourself in the combustible chemistry of these five players.

As her friends and the residents of the gated community continue to disappear, Amy finds herself alone and hunted by the Ram’s Head Killer. Even as she fights to survive, she realizes that nowhere within the gates of Paradise Court is safe…and that there is no escape.
As vast changes spread and wreak havoc in the world of dreams, Calie comes face-to-face with the latest incarnation of one of Wonderland’s most twisted denizens ever created by the realm of madness…the new and improved caterpillar. Meanwhile, an imprisoned Violet learns first-hand what the Duchess and Wonderland really want and the truth of what they are after may very well drive Violet insane.
How do you really know the person living next-door isn’t some kind of maniac serial killer? How do you know the neighbor across the street isn’t watching you and planning to do you harm? You never really can be too sure about the people living around you and as Amy Smith is learning, that’s truer in Paradise Court than maybe anywhere else in the world.
With Violet captured and taken to Wonderland, Calie must once again journey to the realm of dreams gone mad to save her daughter from the diabolical clutches of the Duchess. But the Duchess isn’t the only being standing in Calie’s way, as Wonderland is more than happy to show her that its revenge…is only beginning.
The dramatic– and possibly cataclysmic– conclusion as the CROWN OF KINGS IS ASSEMBLED and JASMINE must fight against Ali, the last of the Jinn, and an ancient GOD!
People are going missing in Paradise Court and only Amy seems to think something sinister is behind their disappearances. No one else wants to believe that something evil is stalking their idealistic, gated community. But beneath the surface of this false paradise lurks a secret so dark that death will seem like a pleasant escape for those it comes to.
Native American Indian myths tell of an ancient evil creature that stalks the wilderness feeding on the flesh of men. When people go missing in the forests of the Pacific Northwest, whispered rumors that the Wendigo is to blame brings legendary monster hunter JP Russ to the scene where he soon finds that the truth is far more dangerous than a myth.
As the Duchess continues to claim victims from the real world, Calie Liddle does her best to ignore the signs that something ominous may be drawing her back into a battle she long thought she and her daughter Violet had escaped. Meanwhile, Violet’s investigation into the missing children leads her to believe that the realm of madness has indeed returned, and the nightmare that is the insanity of Wonderland is only beginning.
Secrets are revealed as Jasmine, Ali, and the remnants of the Forty Thieves travel to the ruins of Machu Picchu and confront the secret, powerful pursuer of the last piece of the Crown of Kings.

I recently came across Humanized, a company that tries to bring the command line to the common man, by exposing operating system or application operations as simple commands, that can be typed at any time. For example, by holding down [Ctrl] and typing "open with" or a part of it, it will automatically open whatever has been selected with the application of your choice. This is part their Enso Launcher application, the other one being Enso Words. Enso Words lets you do all kind of things you would normally do from within a word processor through the humanized command line, from spell checking to word counting. A pleasant change.

Sunaina MAIRA: "The BDS movement and the front lines of the war on academic freedom" (Univ. of Minnesota Press Blog, April 9, 2014).
In December 2013, the American Studies Association announced that it had endorsed an academic boycott of Israeli academic institutions, following two years of discussion in the association and based on a majority vote by the membership in support of the boycott resolution.
"Those of us who have called for a boycott of Israeli academic institutions have done so for quite straightforward reasons. We believe in academic freedom and in the intricate network of intellectual exchanges that it safeguards. We believe this, not primarily because we are concerned with the fate of the profession and its protocols, but because we believe that the academy is part of the world..."
Haim BRESHEETH & Sherna Berger GLUCK: "On the Fallacy of ‘Engaging’ with the Israeli Academy" (CounterPunch, September 20, 2013).
"A standard argument against BDS – the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against the Israeli occupation – and especially the academic boycott- has been the “‘need to engage” with Israelis. In fact, during the 46 years of the occupation, numerous efforts to ‘engage’ have been made repeatedly, all of which are warmly embraced by Israel and its academic institutions."
Ali ABUNIMAH: "Hundreds of academics call for boycott of Hebrew University conference in 2014" (The Electronic Intifada, 26 September 2013).
"...What could possibly be wrong with dialogue, you might ask? Instead, perhaps the appropriate question might be: “is it moral to collaborate with a militarized, racist, colonial state, in order to cleanse its crimes?” Doesn’t this mean that crimes continue and newer ones are perpetrated? Indeed, evidence clearly demonstrates that continuing ‘engagements’ have not led to resolution, but instead served to numb the sensibilities of international academia to the realities of occupied Palestine. In the case of South Africa, it was clear to all academics that there was no way to ‘engage’ with apartheid by speaking to its representatives; the only way to deal with apartheid was to oppose it – to boycott, divest and apply sanctions; to deny South African institutions any support and dialogue; and to follow the advice of the ANC [African National Congress]" (letter by Haim Bresheeth and Sherna Berger Gluck).

I was spending some time researching cargo cults earlier. A usually primitive island culture adopts the symbols of modern technology without understanding what it means, how it works or even what it's supposed to be. The famous examples include the building of whole airports from bamboo with equipment, planes and radios. The idea being that by repeating an airport, they'll bring back planes with supplies. Recently, this more Wasp Factory style cultish island appeared on the media stream and I found myself puzzled by how what would traditionally be considered some sort of arcane horror fiction was tapped in reality.
Remeber Dino Riders? Humans and aliens from the future thrown back in time to the (confusingly broad) age of dinosaurs where they repurpose their spaceship technology to ally or tame the lizards and then continue their pithy war using them as cannon fodder? Well we've got that now with cockroaches and stuff.
Apparently DARPA had a hankering for mind-hacked insects so they could get into small stuff and look at things - don't know, it's not really clear, the point is there's a prevailing attitude in the US of 'if nature can do it, DARPA can do it.' So they've given it a fair shot and they reckon they can actually open up the technology to anyone with around $50 and a few spare hours and a cockroach that looks like it could use a new god-figure in directly controlling its actions. Hell, you can even control your helpless insect slave from your iPhone! Great for a laugh, ah the dominion of man.
OK moral issues aside it is quite clever. Humans have been mind-controlling other human for hundreds of years and this is a step forward. It's hard to sell perfume to a cockroach using David Beckham's underwear, but now you can successfully hook it's brain up to a circuit board.
Cockroaches are probably more useful anyway as well known apocalypse survivors, where dinosaurs as we know didn't do too well.
It's hard to know whether Robert Reich's new film Inequality For All will be political point scoring or an actual real-to-god-holy-fuck-how-did-this-happen documentary in the styling of the superb Inside Job. He was labour Secretary under Clinton and despite an apparent alliance between the two administrations it's easy to see Reich coming out and punching below the belt in favour of the cult of Clinton. The film recently got kickstarter funded which at least means it's not just mindless lobbying but the problem with all these things is (and even Inside Job does this) they look for someone to blame. The modern solution to any intractable problem is to find someone who does or should understand it and get enough people to agree it's their fault and blame them.
I can't 'blame the bankers' for the mess we're in because they were symptomatic of an ideology and just essentially did what people and government told them to do - make a shit load of money and damn the consequences. It's equivalent to laying the blame for a nasty infection at bacteria when really you should have washed your hands properly. Not that I'm comparing high volume trade to a nasty infection.
Anyway, here's a clip from Inequality for All and one from Inside Job because I fucking love that film and might go and watch it now.
Oh and because I'm on a run with great financial docu drama things here's the WHOLE of Enron: Smartest Guys in The Room
The Beeb has done an article about what our future cities might look like. Put aside the sheer volume of work that's been done on this for the last few hundred years by everyone from writers, film makers, artists, designers, architects, engineers, politicians, scientists, religions, financiers, entrepreneurs, big business, minor celebrities, third world dictators, anabaptists and basically every man and his dog and you have quite a boring article that's about twenty years out of date.
Big announcements this week as non-Wired readers suddenly got all giddy about old pictures of Google Glass and a new ad. In Freudian terms this whole thing is aimed at the geek superego. Almost all of the points-of-view and activities of the ad are uniquely male as the larger geek community regrettably is. (See previous posts for info on sexism in geekdom.) But all geeks already have glasses. So we're imagining a world where the type of people who furiously follow tech blogs a) don't already have glasses and b) do stuff like skydiving or whatever which no one actually really does. And if you have to wait until you're skydiving to find use of your Google Glasses I just wouldn't bother with either.
Frankly the whole thing's a little premature and riddled with problems. Plus the dreamy tech projection of everyone hanging around in expensive sporting apparatus in a seemingly perpetual sunset/sunrise has a rank stink of either an apocalyptic scenario or a kitschy folksy ad exec's wet dream with the extra wicker weave. Gross.
Genuinely, it would be more interesting if they showed a video of a guy dodging AR highlighted bulldog shit in Whitechapel.

I've been actively blogging about family history for two and a half years (has it really been that long?); I figured it was time I posted a list of ancestors. I have chosen to use the ahnentafel numbering system. (**)
Below I include names, and the best information I have found so far on years of birth and death, and place of birth. (I've obscured the information for all living individuals)
On their first appearance, I have linked surnames to their respective category labels for relevant blog posts (even if the labels haven't been used yet, they may be at some point), and I have added links to individual memorials on Find a Grave (FGM) where they exist.
While I can only carry the Newmark surname back six generations, I include the numbers for successive generations as a placeholder for the beginning of each generation. Inversely, I can carry my Cruvant ancestors back a few more generations, but I have promised not to share online the research given to me by a cousin, and I wouldn't know those names without her help.
For those unfamiliar with the ahnentafel numbering system, the number for X's father is 2X, and X's mother is 2X+1.
A Brief History of John and Christian Fretz and a complete genealogical family register to the fourth generation with accounts and addresses delivered at the Fretz family reunions, Rev. Abraham James Fretz, 1904. (PDF - 9 MB) (Other Formats)
** Note: Some consider ahnenliste to be the more accurate German word when the numbers are presented in a list format, instead of a table. However, English-speaking genealogists seem to have largely adopted the term 'ahnentafel' to refer to both 'table' and 'list' format. "We don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary." - James D. Nicoll, 1990
Early Sun. game in Houston. Last week, Texans got buried by Rams 33 - 7. Cards looked meh in their loss to division rival Seattle. Houston became unglued in the second half vs. LA. Houston is now 3 & 6. Cards are 4 & 5. Neither team figures to be feeling pretty good about itself. Cards are without starting QB Carson Palmer for most or all of the season, and may be without #2 backup Drew Stanton for one or two weeks - both due to injury. Next man up is Blaine Gabbert (considered long on potential/not-so-long on production). The wind is blowing in the direction of Stanton starting vs. the Texans.
According to local Houston scribe, Marc Vandermeer: "For a while it looked like it could happen - that the Texans could generate just enough on offense while the defense was putting the brakes on the top scoring team in the NFL. But the third quarter hit and the Rams erupted with three touchdowns to put the game out of reach..." Rams won going away - 33 - 7.
Houston received. TB on KO. On the 5th play from scrimmage, Savage was sacked, by Donald, fumbled and lost the ball. Rams ball on Houston 12. LA had to settle for a 27-yd FG. . Rams 3 - Houston 0.
TB on KO. After Miller gained 18 yds up the middle, Houston's drive stalled near mid-field. TB on Punt. LA held to 3 & out. Punt returned to Houston 43. Texans managed to move to the LA 38, but had to punt from the LA 38. Punt downed at the LA 4. A minus-11 yd sack by Blackson neutralized an 11-yd gain by Gurley. Rams puntedfrom their own 8. Punt was O-O-B at the Houston 37. A roughness penalty on T Johnson helped move Texans to the LA 20 as the quarter ended.
A defensive holding penalty pushed Houston back to the Ram 30. A Savage-to-Miller hookup moved Houston to the LA 16 where Fairborne's 34-yd FG try was no good. Ram ball on their own 24. It became ""All Gurley Time": A 43-yd pass to Gurley (followeed by a 15-yd run by Gurley and a minus-7 yd run by Gurley helped set up a 33-yd FG by Zuerlein. Rams 6 - Houston 0.
TB on KO. Houston put together an 8 play TD drive capped by a 26-yd Savage-to-Ellington TD pass. (Other key Plays: Savage to Anderson for +17. Savage to Hopkins for +18. Fuller injured. Houston 7 - Rams 6.
KO returned to LA 18. They managed to get to their own 32, where the Rams"went for it" on a fake punt on 4th & 7. They didn't make it. Houston ball on the Ram 38 with 3:30 left til the half. Right out of the box, Miller picked up 21-yds around RE. On the 6th play of the Houston possession, Savage's pass for Fiedorwicz was intercepted by Barron. Ram ball on their own 25 with 1:35 on the clock. Ten plays (& 1:16) later, Zuerlein's 50-yd FG attempt was good. Rams 9 - Houston 7.
Rams received. KO returned to Ram 25. They managed to get to their own 37 before punting. Punt O-O--B at the Houston 20. In a penalty-racked series, Houston managed to moved to their own 39 before punting. Punt returned to the Ram 4. On the second play from scrimmage, Goff hit Wood for a 94-yd TD. . Rams 16 - Houston 7.
TB on KO. Houston went 3 & out. Punt (net penalty) put ball on the LA 9. Rams mnageed to get to near mid-field, but Scarlett's sack of Goff helped set up a punt from the LA 48. TB on punt. Ball on Texan 20. Houston held to 3 & out again. Punt returned to Houston 36. After Goff hit Watkins for +24 yds, he came back and hooked up with Watson for a 17-yd TD. Rams 23 - Houston 7.
TB on KO. On the first play from scrimmage, Savage was sacked by Ekuban & fumbled. Ball recovered by T Walker. Rams ball at the Houston 12. First Ram play: A 12-yd Goff-to-Woods TD pass. Rams 30 - Houston 7.
Houston drive stalled and they punted. Punt fair caught at the Ram 11. A 35-yd rub around RE by Gurley followed by a 30-yd completion to Woods were key plays in a 9-play LA (6:26) drive capped by a 33-yd Zuerlein FG. Rams 33 - Houston 7.
TB on KO. Houston moved from their own 25 in 7 plays to the Ram 11, but a Savage for Hopikins pass was intercepted and returned to the Ram 25. Five runs by Dunbar followed by 3 knees. Game Over.
Savage was 18 of 36 221 yds, 1 TD's and 2 interceptions. (Goff went 25 of 37 for 365 yards, 3 TD's and no interceptions)
L Miller was the top Houston ground gainer with 60 yds on 11 carries. (Foreman was next with 18 yds on 7 carrries). (Rams gained 104 yds on the ground).
Hopkins (7 for 111) and Ellington (4 for 41 & a TD )led the 'Hawks in catches. (Woods, Gurley and Kupp shredded the Houston pass defense with 20 catches for 286 yds)
Defensively, Jackson (5), Joseph (5), Scarlet (4) and Hal (4) led the Texans in tackles Scarlett had 2 sacks. Clowney had one. Savage was sacked 3 times.
Turnover Ratio: Houston: Minus-4. Savage was intercepted twice. Houston lost two fumbles. Rams had no interceptions and no lost fumbles.
T Branch is out for season. B Baker has been elevated. Stanton is lining up at starting QB/Gabbert is getting additional snaps and plays most suitable for him.
Rookie phenom Deshaun Watson is on IR. He's beem replaced by backup Tom Savage. Statistically, Savage looks to be more "game manager" than playmaker.
Cards will be without Tyron Branch. Budda Baker will be elevated to take his place. Look for more big plays in the secondary punctuated by a few miscommunication and coverage miscues deep.
Hopkins (803 yds) is the Houston feature receiver, but there's a big gap between him and the next guy on the roster (with 243). Expect Patrick Peterson to shut down Hopkins with the rest of the coverage responsibilities spread around. Statistically, Hoiuston gets sacked far more than it sacks. Could be a big day for Cardinal pass rushers.
To date, Houston has generated 1151 ground yards while giving up 872. Stands to reason that they'll try to keep the Cardinal offense off the field by controlling the ball; mainly on the ground.
When they want to, the Cardinals can shut down any running attack in the NFL. What should help this Sunday is that they'll be facing an offense that doesn't spread around its threats too widely - i.e. shut down Hopkins in the passing attack and zero in on Miller in both the pass and run game, and the Cards should be able to keep everything under control.
With Carson Palmer on IR and his backup Drew Stanton suffering an injury last Sunday, you'd think the, Cards would start #3 QB Blaine Gabbert. But the desert winds are blowing in favor of Stanton starting and Gabbert waiting in the wings (Ed Note - Don't be surprised if BA airs it out early to build enough of an early lead to bring in Gabbert for the final quarter or even the 2H of the game).
The absence of Watt and Mercilus has taken some of the venom from the Texan pass rush - a potential godsend for a banged up Cardinal OL led by LT returnee Jared Veldheer and a group of backups.
Last week the battered OL did a yeoman like job keeping the Seahawks off Stanton. Accoridng to BA, the main problem last week was less a matter of porous pass blocking and more to do with multiple cases of dropsy by Cardinal receivers.
The two Texan MLB's (Cunningham and McKinney) lead the Texans in tackles with their FS (Hal) close behind them). Texans have a strong "run-yards gained" vs. "run yds surrendered" ratio. (Note - Although they're not ranked that high as tacklers, their OLB's (Clowney and Scarlett) aren't exactly chopped liver. This may be one of those bizarre contests where BA uses Peterson to set up the pass.
Seattle- Lechler's a good punter. Fairborn's two misses were between from 30 - 40 yds (Kind of reminds you of a veteran kicker we know).
Cardinals - Looks like an even matchup - Dawson & Fairbairn; Lee and Lechler; KW and Thompson/TodmanDawson. Elevation of B Baker to safety may weaken us in the coverage game.
Houston - HC Bill OBrien...AC/Def Romeo Crennel... DC Mike Vrabel... ST Larry Izzo. Both teams may be struggling with injuries to key players and a case of the "losing record second half blahs."
Cards - HC Bruce Arians. OC Harold Goodwin, DC James Bettcher ST Amos Jones. The "QB Whisperer" has to get production out of his third-stringer, Blaine Gabbert on a banged-up team heading in a sub-.500 direction.
Houston appears to be more "solid" than "explosive." They'll probably try to take our run away and dare Stanton and his receivers to beat them via the pass. Some teams have been successful vs. the Cards by keeping conservative, minimizing mistakes and letting the Cards "beat themselves." Two ways to counter this are: (1) make fewer mistakes or (2) blow the other team out of the water with a lot of home-run stuff.
It's that time of year when the people around non-contending teams resort to filling the interview rooms with platitudes - (i.e. "it ain't over till it's over; one day at a time etc. etc. etc.)
Fighting the blahs is no easy matter. I find it easier to get through the night by treating the second half of the season as not all that different from the first few games of preseason (where you try to uncover a few "diamonds in the rough" and figure out what kind of team you're gonna have.
On paper, we should be able to handle the Texans - which make this game a poster child for a gut-wrenching upset. High hopes/less high expectations. Get 'em!

In a recent blitz of promotion for their new film, um, 'The Promotion', writer/director Steve Conrad and star Seann William Scott each gave us a chance to ask about the supermarket-set dramedy.
Between this film and The Weather Man, you�ve arguably carved a niche out finding the comedy and drama in middle-class malaise, specifically set in Chicago. Does this material stem from personal experience, or is this more akin to professional happenstance?
It�s a little bit of both. Any really good writer has to figure out some stuff beyond the events of his own life in order to be interesting to his audience members. There�s definitely some events from my grown-up life that I feel very deeply about that I�ve incorporated in, that I�ve called upon in my last three scripts, namely on a very urgent need to get a job when I had a kid and was young, and there are different ways of looking at work and whatever piece of mind that brings.
Doug (played by Seann William Scott) carries a fascination with being referred to as "Mr." and wearing the long sleeves someday. Why do you think that�s such a point of pride when even his own boss insists that they remain on a first-name basis?
What raised that issue was the first time he�s having that conversation with that pediatric plastic surgeon, because you have to call a doctor a new word, not even "Mr.", even when they�re not in their white coat. Doug is like two rungs away from that, and so he believes in commanding respect through his accomplishments.
What�s harder, adapting a true story to the screen, as was the case with The Pursuit of Happyness, or trying to make your original story real to life?
Trying to come up with something out of nowhere, from scratch, is so much harder than when the events are laid out for you in another mechanism such as a book. Adaptations provide you with a real leg up.
When did you first hear about Employee of the Month, and at that moment, did you let out a big sigh?
I knew Dax Shepard, and he called me and he just did this movie that he had a part in, and it just seems to always happen that way. When my first film [1993�s Wrestling Ernest Hemingway] came out, it was about two old guys, and that same week was when Grumpy Old Men was opening, so that�s just how it always seems to work out.
It was a relief and a joy because you don�t have to leave the room when it comes to important meetings, like picking costumes, which can tell you as much about the character as what they do and say. The drag of it is trying to find a relationship to the writing, and I found that I had to be hard on what I wrote.
I regard John as the best actor in the world, and he scared the hell out of me for the first few days of the shoot, coming off a Scorsese set and some Paul Thomas Anderson films. He just brings a whole lot of heavy-duty pedigree to it. Seann was pretty aggressive about getting the role, and was willing to work really hard at it.
Both you and [Seann William] Scott made mention of how you found Reilly to be intimidating. Does he turn off once the camera does?
It wasn�t so much him as it was his pedigree that was intimidating to me, with Martin Scrosese and three Paul Thomas Anderson films. I was intimidated by his resume, but not his attitude.
What do you feel in this current value of film criticism in this industry? What about its value to you through your experiences to date?
It�s changing, because of the blogs and the amount of the people that don�t go to the typical Siskel & Ebert thing. That day has come and gone, where they had a little say, but that time has passed. A new thing is going to happen, and one person who can connect to an audience in a meaningful way from some resource like that is going to pop up somehow. I�m always around something like 53% with my stuff on Rotten Tomatoes, so I know that I�m always going to split people in half and I steel myself for that. Interviews go better because of how I might answer different kinds of questions, as opposed to reviews, where you can�t really defend yourself. But I was reading this book by David Mamet, and he basically said that you can either do nothing or be criticized.
What can you tell us, if anything, about Chad Schmidt (about a struggling actor in the '80s has to cope with the fact that he looks and sounds all too much like... rising star Brad Pitt)?
Well, I just got done with that project, and now Brad gets to have his pick of directors. I think he already has a few choices in mind, and I�d like to do it, but it�s really his call.
Well, most of the films that I�ve done, I�ve done with first-time directors, and with Steve, I was just impressed by how confident he was on set, and I think he�ll do some really wonderful things in the future.
It was intimidating as hell. My motivation was pretty much not to screw up the film for him, and it was stressful, because he�s so good. He really added so many colors to his performance, and I mean, the guy�s just an unbelievable actor. I might be biased because, you know, I�m in the film, but I think his performance is probably the best thing in it.
Did the likes of Stifler and your characters in Road Trip and The Rundown make you feel any personal pressure to show range from the cocky roles, or was that just a stepping stone of sorts to get more subdued or dramatic roles?
I don�t worry about those things, because every single actor gets typecast at some point. I don�t worry, because I thoroughly enjoy doing those broad comedies and having that chance to make people laugh, but I�ve always been anxious to do films that I�d like to watch at home, which includes The Promotion, and there�s something to be said about being in those films. I mean, it�s going to be difficult to work with someone like David Fincher until I�m not distracting by being in his film, but without those [comedies], I wouldn�t have my career today. But this was a determined choice, these are the type of projects that I want the people I want to work with to see me in, so I think it�s a step in the right direction, and I just hope to plug away and always do good work.
That was amazing. I take what I do very seriously, and I felt it was a good opportunity for me. I loved Donnie Darko, and I really enjoy Richard�s work, and there were days when we wondering if we had the tone right, but I respect him for having a vision and not having to flinch. I really respect that and really like that, and I found it all to be really rewarding.
As someone who�s primarily made a career to date doing comedy, do you feel a need to strike a balance between gag-based humor and more character-driven material, like this?
I�m not really like the characters I�ve played in the past. I don�t see myself as a funny guy at all. I wanted to do drama, and then American Pie came my way, and I found myself being the guy who says what no one�s supposed to say, and doing what no one�s supposed to do. But my strength lies in doing more darker and dramatic stuff. I love watching movies, and I watch more dramas and foreign films than comedies, but when it comes to my own work, it�s going to have to be the right one. I think people have to be ready for it, and that�s a transition I�ll have to make.

By Anthony D’Alessandro HollywoodNews.com: The “Weeds” season six opener of “Thwack” unfortunately doesn’t live up to its pointed title, however, the good news is that creator Jenji Kohan is finally moving the Botwin family away from the Mexican border after they’ve overstayed the drama there for the last two seasons.

Even before I became pregnant with our first baby, I knew that I wanted to birth at home if at all possible, simply because I knew I'd be far more comfortable and at ease in my own home than in a hospital. But the more research I did on the issue, the more statistics I read about rates of C-sections in hospitals, and the more birth stories of all kinds I heard, the more I became convinced that a home birth was not only what would suit me best, but was what would be safest both for me and the baby. I shared what I'd learned with my husband, Nathan, but he actually didn't take any convincing at all--he was extremely supportive and all for a home birth as soon as I brought the idea up.
We are lucky enough to live only about 20 minutes away from the only midwifery practice in our state that offers home births (the American prenatal care system is a bit different than in the UK), and so when I became pregnant in February of 2006, we contacted the midwives' office. They offer a free appointment to all prospective patients just to meet and ask questions and decide whether their practice is right, and so we set up an appointment. From the moment we met Louise and Pam, the two primary midwives of the practice, we knew that they were absolutely what we were looking for. They were both simply lovely people, and combined expert medical knowledge with a birth philosophy that exactly matched our own. When Nathan and I left their office after our first meeting, I knew that I couldn't have felt more confident about putting ourselves and our baby in their care. My confidence only increased throughout my pregnancy. They made each checkup appointment feel like visiting friends and were always happy to spend as much time as it took to answer whatever questions we might have. I found it was easy to be excited rather than anxious about the labor and birth; I was actually looking forward to it.
I had read about Maggie Howell's hypnobirthing CD's on this website, and purchased the one designed for homebirth preparation. I listened to it a few times a week from the beginning of the third trimester on, and then every day during the last few weeks of pregnancy. I had a pretty low success rate of managing to stay awake throughout the entire thing, but I still felt that it helped tremendously in preparing me mentally for the whole process of the labor and birth. Also, during the last couple of months, Nathan and I enrolled in a Bradley method childbirth class, which we both really liked. The Bradley preparation focused on labor as a team effort and spent a great deal of time on what the husband could do to help, and that approach made me feel much more comfortable and confident about the prospect of the birth. I knew I wouldn't have to be doing it all on my own, that Nathan would be right there helping me get through. And Nathan was fantastic about preparing and practicing for labor--he would help me with the physical exercises we'd been given to do and we also spent time every night practicing relaxation, which is another key component of the Bradley method. I would lie on our bed and he would help me progressively relax every muscle, starting from my feet and working up, so that by the time labor rolled around I was really "programmed" to relax completely at his touch. Lastly, I read the page on this site about getting your baby "lined up" for birth, and followed all the suggestions for encouraging the baby to be anterior rather than posterior--not slumping back with my feet up, etc. During the last couple of weeks I also did lots and lots of squats, which I think helped a lot in bringing the baby's head down into my pelvis--by the time I went into labor, the head was already at the zero station.
So . . . on to the labor itself. Like many first time moms, probably, I was sure I was going to go early--especially since around 2 weeks before our due date I started having strong Braxton Hicks contractions and lots of period-type pains. And also like a lot of first time-moms, I found that my baby was going to come when it was good and ready and not before! By the time 5 days after our due date had gone by, I was starting to feel like my pregnancy was going to go on forever--I was convinced my baby would be the first child in history to be turning school-age while still in the womb! But 6 days past the due date, I woke up with a feeling that today would be the day--I'm not sure why, but something in me just knew. I even had a feeling that labor would start around 2 pm. And sure enough, right around 2, I had my first contraction--just a painless Braxton-Hicks type contraction, but it still felt quite strong. The contractions kept coming all afternoon at fairly regular intervals, but they were still painless and weren't at all bothersome. I was still feeling like this was "it", and at the same time trying not to get my hopes up in case it wasn't, but that afternoon a friend called to chat for a bit, and she said she was could tell I was going into labor just by listening to my voice--she said I sounded like an athlete about to run a marathon. Anyway, by around 7 pm that night, I was beginning to think she was right! The contractions were coming about every 10 minutes and were starting to get stronger and a bit painful. They were also accompanied by some emergency runs to the bathroom, which also made me think that this was the real thing and not a false alarm.
Nathan and I phoned the midwives to let them know that things seemed to be happening. Louise was on call that night. She agreed that this was probably "it," advised me to try to get some sleep while things were still fairly low-key, and said to call her when the contractions changed--as she put it, shifted into a new gear, either more frequent or more intense. Nathan and I made a quick trip to the library to rent a video to watch later on (I picked a travel video guide to Great Britain, figuring it wouldn't require too much concentration and that the scenery would be relaxing to watch), and while we were there I started to feel more pressure in my pelvis and was more uncomfortable standing up. When we got home, I went to bed and put on my hypnotherapy CD. I didn't exactly fall asleep, but I managed to doze for a few hours. Then I got Nathan, and we did our progressive relaxation exercise; that helped a good deal, and I managed to doze for another couple of hours.
At around 1:30, the contractions suddenly got much more intense, so that I couldn't sleep anymore. I had read that I'd know when active labor had begun because I wouldn't be able to talk through contractions, which had scared me a bit because that sounded like quite a lot of pain. But it wasn't like what I had imagined at all. The contractions were intense, and there was pain with them, certainly, but it wasn't the pain that kept me from wanting to talk. It was more like I just had to focus inward with every contraction and concentrate on what my body was doing. The pain was definitely manageable, and in between contractions I felt absolutely fine.
I got up, and thought I'd try getting in a warm bath, so Nathan filled up the tub and helped me in. I had expected to really like laboring in water, so I was quite surprised to find I didn't like it at all! When the water was warm enough to relax my muscles, I felt overheated and uncomfortable, and when it was cooler I just felt wet and in labor instead of only in labor, which wasn't much help. We called Louise again to let her know that things seemed to be shifting gears and she asked whether we wanted her to come over. We were coping fine on our own, so she said to phone back when the contractions were closer together. I got out of the tub and put on the new nightgown and robe set I'd bought specially for the birth. It sounds silly, but that actually made me feel better than anything else. It was just a cheap cotton floral nightgown and robe from WalMart--I think I paid something like $12 for it--but somehow being in fresh, brand new clothes really helped--like getting dressed up for prom or a date.
I had read that you should try to eat during early labor if possible, since you'll need the energy later on, so Nathan fixed me a snack and I ate in our living room while he carried on with getting the birthing supplies set out. Then I got up to help and we got the bedroom set up--the sheets changed, the "good" blankets put away, the diapers and baby clothes set out. We were laughing and talking and I was amazed that this was labor--we were totally relaxed, just having fun and enjoying the time together. It felt really good to squat down with every contraction, and every so often we'd time a few to see whether they were getting any closer. We took some pictures of the two of us sitting on our couch, which I love looking at now--they're my last images of myself pregnant and Nathan and I before we became parents. We also said prayers together. Then we watched some of our travel video, and by the time we were about halfway through, the contractions were coming about 3 mins. apart, so we called Louise again and she said she'd come over along with Sarah, their student midwife.
Louise and Sarah arrived with all their gear, and were so lovely, even though I'd routed them out of bed in the middle of the night. I felt almost like I was having friends over for a visit. Soon after they arrived, Sarah checked me, which, as it turned out, was my only internal exam. I was a little nervous about finding out how far along I was--so far I felt fine, but I was afraid I'd be discouraged if I wasn't very far along. But as it turned out, I was already at 5 cm., and actually went to almost 6 with a contraction that hit while Sarah was checking me. I was very, very encouraged by that. The pain still felt completely manageable, and I was completely relaxed and happy and calm. And that's actually how it stayed throughout the whole rest of labor. The hypnobirthing CD had talked a lot about welcoming each contraction as bringing you one step closer to meeting your baby, and I think it helped me a lot in that regard. Nathan commented after the birth that he was amazed that from start to finish of the labor I never once mentioned the pain or even groaned--but I honestly never even thought about doing either at the time. Even though the contractions hurt, I found I was happy and excited when each one struck. Both Nathan and Louise and Sarah were also huge help to me in getting through the contractions as the pain gradually got more intense. Nathan kept telling me what a great job I was doing, and I remember him saying over and over, "You're doing so great--you're making this look easy!"
Throughout the night, we all four sat in our living room chatting, and when a contraction came I would hop onto my birthing ball, which I'd found to be the most comfortable place to deal with the contractions. Nathan would rub my back or massage my shoulders through the pain, and from time to time Sarah would listen to the baby's heartbeat to make sure everything was going all right for the little one. Then we'd go back to chatting. I can truly say that my labor was great fun. When Sarah looked at her watch and said it was 6 am, I couldn't believe it--the night had just flown by for me.
The contractions started to get quite painful around dawn, and Louise, who had originally said we could probably hope for a lunch-time baby said we might actually get one by breakfast time. The contractions were getting pretty painful at this point, and I was a little worried about how I'd cope if they went on for several hours this way. But then I started burping, and realized, thanks to what we'd learned in our Bradley classes, that this must be transition. I didn't have any of the other dreaded transition symptoms we'd learned about, although I did start to feel a bit fuzzy-headed, I suppose because of the endorphins my body was releasing. I'd been trying to hold off on moving to the bed for as long as I could, but I finally felt tired enough that I really wanted to lie down for awhile--and as it turned out, it was a good thing we moved to the bed when we did. Almost as soon as I lay down, a contraction hit, and as it struck my body suddenly started pushing. And with the push, my water broke. Second stage labor had begun!
The baby was moving down along my spine at this point, and the pain was definitely the most intense I'd felt yet. When another contraction hit, I asked Nathan to push on my back, and so he started to apply counter-pressure. What he'd forgotten was that he was standing on the shower curtain we'd laid down by the bed to protect the carpet. I had my eyes closed, but I heard him slide backwards, lose his balance, and say, "Yikes--I'm standing on plastic!" I burst out laughing and then apparently (although I don't remember this part) said, "Oooh, don't make me laugh!" Everyone thought it was pretty funny that he'd made me crack up even in the middle of a pushing contraction! The pain was pretty intense, and again I was a little worried about how I'd handle it if the pushing phase went on for too long--I'd heard of many second stage labors lasting 3 or 4 hours. But with the second or third contraction, Louise and Sarah told me they could see dark hair, and with one more contraction after that, Louise pulled my hand down and put it on the baby's head--a feeling I'll never, ever forget. So I knew I was close, and that really helped me get through the pain.
My body did all the work for me--I wasn't consciously pushing at all. Each time a contraction hit, it was a bit like my body was taken over by an alien force, leaving me with no control whatever of what was going on. That was a little scary, too, but Louise and Sarah and Nathan kept cheering me on, and I remember Louise holding my hand and telling me over and over to "say yes to it," when a contraction came, which really helped. I had Nathan in sort of a headlock, too, poor guy--hanging onto him for dear life, which was somehow very reassuring, as well. 30 minutes passed in a blur, and then the baby's head was out--that part felt a lot like I would have expected and hurt a lot, but it was over very quickly. With the next contraction, our daughter was born, after about 7 hours of active labor. Nathan and I were laughing and crying all at the same time--and our daughter was screaming! She must have read the apgar guidelines that said "vigorous crying" was needed for a perfect 10! Nathan cut the cord and I held her skin to skin on my chest for awhile before Sarah and Louise did a quick examination, wrapped her in a blanket, and gave her back to me. She weighed in at 7lbs and was 20 inches long.
Our little girl had come out "waving," with one hand up to her face, so I had a small tear that needed a couple of stitches. I held the baby while Sarah stitched me up, and then Nathan held her while Louise and Sarah helped me shower. An hour after the birth, we were all three tucked in bed sharing the good news with our parents on the phone and eating breakfast. I was amazed at how well I felt--a bit tired, but otherwise fine. And Louise and Sarah had cleaned up everything--you would never have known that a baby had been born in the room.
It's now been a bit over four months since Isabella Rose was born, and not a day has gone by that I haven't thought about how wonderful our maternity care and birth experience was. Laboring at home was simply fantastic--the comfort of familiar surroundings definitely contributed to how relaxed I was throughout. And besides being gorgeous and perfect and an utter joy and delight, Isabella has been and is absolutely the most peaceful, happy little girl imaginable. While I would love to credit her wonderful gene pool, I truly think that her being born at home had a lot to do with what a calm, easy-going baby she has been. From the moment she was born, she was never out of her mom and dad's care and spent her first days in the world in the quiet and security of our own home. Nathan and I found, too, that having a home birth really helped prepare us to work as a team in caring for our baby girl and made our adjustment to being new parents really very smooth. I hope our birth story will encourage other first time moms who are thinking about a homebirth--I am truly convinced that unless there's a true need for medical intervention, home is absolutely the ideal place to deliver. When we decide to start trying for Isabella's little brother or sister, we will definitely plan on another birth at home!
Get Your Baby Lined Up - what it means when your baby gets in an awkward position, and what you can do about it.
This article is part of a series that explains the different kinds of contingencies that can be included within a real estate purchase agreement. Today, we will take an in-depth look at the home inspection contingency in particular. Home inspection clauses are a common element in purchase contracts. So it’s important to understand how they work.
Within the context of a real estate purchase agreement or contract, a “contingency” is a condition that must be met — or an action that must be completed — in order for the sale to move forward. There are several different kinds of contingencies, including one that pertains to the home inspection.
Definition: A home inspection contingency is a clause written into a real estate contract that gives the buyer the right to have the house inspected by a professional inspector within a certain period of time. It also allows the buyer to cancel the contract (or negotiate repairs) if they are not comfortable with the inspector’s findings.
To understand how a home inspection contingency works, it helps to consider it within the broader context of the buying process.
Based on this report, the buyer can do one of three things: (1) accept the home as-is, (2) request that the sellers make certain repairs, or (3) walk away from the deal.
So the home inspection contingency gives the buyers the right to order an inspection, and to back out of the deal if they’re unhappy with the results. Most importantly, it allows the buyer to recover the earnest money deposit they provided when they first made the offer. *
* Important note: In order for the buyer to recover the earnest money deposit, it has to be clearly spelled out in the contract (see example below). Otherwise, the buyer could end up forfeiting the deposit. This is usually how it works, though laws and procedures can vary from state to state. Consult with a local real estate professional to be sure.
Below, you’ll find an example home inspection contingency that might be included within a real estate purchase agreement. This sample uses common language that is often used within such contingencies.
The Buyers’ offer is contingent upon a satisfactory inspection within ten (10) days. Upon receipt of the results of such inspection, the Buyers may request in writing at any time within that ten (10) day period that the Sellers make certain repairs or that the Sellers reduce the sales price to compensate for such defect(s). Such a request to repair or reduce the price does not terminate the contract and the Sellers shall have ______ days from receipt of such request to agree to make such repairs or reduce the sales price. If the Sellers do not agree, the Buyers shall have ______ days to waive the contingency and accept the property “as-is” or to declare the contract null and void. Earnest money and accumulated interest will be returned to Buyer within 48 hours upon written notification to Seller or his/her agent that contract has been terminated by Buyer.
Note: This is just a generic sample of a home inspection clause. It might not be applicable in all situations. Real estate documents and procedures vary.
In some states, there is a standard or default number of days for the home inspection contingency. But there may also be a blank line where the buyer can enter an alternate number of days.
For example, the standard purchase agreement might state that the “Buyer has 7 (or _____ ) days to request a home inspection.” In this case, the default number of days for the home inspection contingency is seven. But it can be set for a longer or shorter time period, as long as the buyer and seller agree on it.
The standard, or customary, number of days allowed for a home inspection can vary. In most cases, the buyers will have the property inspected within days of the purchase agreement being signed. So these clauses are usually set for somewhere between five and ten days.
Once the inspection has been completed, the buyers’ agent will typically write up an addendum to the original purchase agreement that removes the home inspection contingency. And the transaction can then move forward unimpeded.

For some years now I have stopped using gaskets on my engines after deciding that they were never there for my benefit but used to compensate for poor manufacturing, and in my experience always leak after a while.
I am talking of course about old British iron and not modern machines, my Triumph twin has only a cyl head and base gasket as they are dissimilar metals.
I know I am not the first to do this, but this is my method and can honestly say that non of my old bikes leak oil after running for a few years even with HTF fluid in chaincases etc.
Faces have to be flat and a bit of lapping may be necessary, after that a groove is cut in one half and this gives a means of retaining the jointing compound (I use Hylomar Blue as its good enough for Rolls Royce).
The obvious tool to use is a Dremel type device, mine is made from an old hand piece from a flexi drive connected to a 12 volt drill motor but the important bit is controlling the the cutter as its a freehand process.
A simple guide attachment was made and a cutter from a 1/8 centre drill ground to a D bit shape does the job, about 15 thou deep is enough.
It is important to work from the inside face so any slip ups do no harm and just like milling,direction of cut has a bearing.
The first pic was freehand and I just about got away with it, the second was guided with the attachment and the difference is pretty obvious.
Great Idea OlderDan! Wish I would have thought of it. I noticed you stayed a bit south of center line too which is smart in my book. Turnips are notorious leakers!! Back when I built mine I did lap all the faces but used an amazing product I found back then called Kawasaki Bond...best sealant I ever used...had a silver look/compound in it and it came apart well and cleaned up easily. Blue and Red silicone was just out then and never did have much luck with it until the formulas improved. The early KB I used is Long gone now and haven't tried the newer silicone based version...but like you say if Hylomar Blue is good enough for Rolls...it'll work for me. Haven't heard of that before but will have a look for it over here.
Had a water issue with one of the vehicles while back with a cover plate and 2 hold downs. Think its a casting port on the block, not sure and why not a freeze plug although its a machined face & bore...maybe an Option port?? Dealer said to only use Black RTV. The plate is SS with a slight return flange and the block is AL and of course it's in a PITA place to reach and clean without removing the entire front clip, but got it best I could, applied the thin coat as directed, cross torqued between the 2 nut/studs, checked...all good. About a month later the temp gauge spiked again. Checked, sure enough dripage! This time I pulled the 2 studs by hook or crook and fabbed a flat sanding tool I could get up there with...sure enough not flat and also checked the new flange plate but it was flat. This time I goobed about twice as much Black RTV to squeeze out to the edges of the plate and smoothed it to form a fillet seal to the flange. So far it's fine now about a year later.
I remember that KB stuff, I think it had an aluminum content, like you I never had much luck with silicone.
I don,t want to sound like a rep for HB but it also works great on plumbing compression fittings as its non setting.
Your method is the business and if I had the means I would copy, I guess you use o-ring of the roll and join them

JOINT BASE SAN ANTONIO-RANDOLPH, Texas — When the first day of school begins Monday, 450 students at Randolph High School will be learning in classrooms with more space, going from class to class in wider hallways and utilizing technology upgrades in a new 44,000-square-foot building dedicated Aug. 10 by Randolph Field Independent School District officials.
The two-story classroom facility is part of a new 77,000-square-foot high school complex being constructed behind the old high school building, which was built in 1962. The $15 million project includes the construction of a new cafeteria and gymnasium that will be housed together in a separate 33,000-square-foot building, with an expected completion date of March 2017. There will also be a demolition of the old high school campus.
Lance Johnson, RFISD superintendent, told students the new high school building will help provide them with the education and tools they need to succeed after they graduate.
“We are raising a generation who will be the leaders of this country,” Johnson said. “Our job as educators is to make sure you are equipped to compete at a global level when you leave Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph. Our vision goes outside the fence of JBSA-Randolph. This is for you students.”
The new building includes 25 classrooms, four science labs, three computer labs, restrooms, administrative offices, technology improvements – wireless access points, more data capabilities and upgraded data cabling – a nurse’s office and a secure door entering the building.
“The building itself is just more modern,” Johnson said. “It’s fresh, it’s nice and new. We are so excited to see students laughing and walking around and getting an education – the best education in the world – in these hallways.”
Johnson said the construction of the new high school complex was made possible by the vision of present and former RFISD school board members. He also thanked Gallagher Construction for their work in being the school district’s project manager for the new complex, as well as U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar for his help in securing a U.S. Department of Education grant covering part of the project’s cost.
The Department of Education grant is covering $10.4 million of the project’s cost, with the remainder – $4.7 million – coming from the school district’s fund balance. For the school district to receive the grant, the Department of Education stipulated the old high school building, which it owned, be torn down.
The dedication ceremony included remarks from RFISD board president Jimmy Cornelius and two Randolph High School graduates, Lt. Col. Peter Duffy, 435th Fighter Training Squadron assistant director of operations, and Courtney White, a teacher and coach at Randolph Middle School. Duffy, a 1995 graduate, and White, a 1998 graduate, both spoke about their positive experiences as students at Randolph High School. White gave the invocation for the opening of the new building and for the students and staff who will be learning and working in it.
After the dedication and ribbon-cutting, Johnson and Mark Malone, Randolph High School principal, conducted a tour of the new high school building.
The new high school classrooms are a definite upgrade from the old high school building, Malone said.
“Everything is upgraded for learning,” he said. “These kids are the children of military members who make a great sacrifice. Why would we not give them the best facilities we can?”
Deborah Pannabecker, Randolph High School science teacher, said her classroom and lab space is three times the size of what she had in the old building. Her former classroom did not have any instructional desks, so students had to sit on stools and use the lab tables for desk areas.
“The kids will be able to have a much more engaging experience in the classroom because we have separate instructional and lab areas,” Pannabecker said.
Brooke LaMantia, a Randolph High School senior and president of the school’s Fellowship of Christian Athletes who gave the closing prayer at the dedication, said she was excited about going to school in the new building.

Today the systematic dispossession of the Palestinian people continues unabated and largely unchallenged by the United States and the European Union. Barriers to Palestinian mobility, social and political development are visible everywhere. While Jewish-Israeli citizens pass freely, more than 500 police and military checkpoints regulate Palestinian movement between the occupied West Bank and Israel. Passing through these checkpoints on a recent fact-finding tour organized by the US Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, we witnessed Palestinians endure a daily ritual of subordination, humiliation and suspicion..

Podcasts are audio broadcasts used to spread the word across the social web. Podcasts are created by professionals, amateurs or anyone with access to a computer and a microphone, and can be on any topic under the sun.
What makes podcasts different is that new podcasts usually come out daily or weekly, with a changing topic or guest speaker. You can subscribe to podcasts through a service like iTunes or through your RSS feed reader, or listen to the cast directly at its site.
As a note, podcasts are different than streaming audio or internet radio. Podcasts have distinct starting and ending points, while streaming audio flows like a river of sound. Our next post will discuss streaming audio online.
Podcasts are a great way to get news updates, to listen to a weekly show, and keep your music updated and fresh. Most importantly, once you’ve subscribed to a podcast, it comes to you automatically as it comes out – you don’t need to keep going and getting the latest episode yourself.
One of the most natural podcast sources is radio. NPR’s podcast directory is a testament to the continuing appeal of well-created audio-only news and entertainment. Find other sources of radio podcasts at PublicRadioFan.com or using your favorite search engine.
Speaking of radio, have you ever heard of live radio dramas? Before television, these terrifying or hysterically funny shows were audio-only entertainment on radio stations around the world, full of special sound effects and live music. Thanks to the internet, they’ve made a comeback in the form of podcasts. Local to Boston, the Post Meridian Radio Players bring live radio drama to the air with its science fiction series The Mask of Inanna and its stage and studio horror performances of Tomes of Terror and p.m..
Other podcasts from traditional media include Nature magazine, the New York Times, PodMed (the Johns Hopkins Medicine News Roundup), C-Span, BusinessWeek and Sesame Street!
If you enjoy running for exercise or for fun, check out the Podrunner podcats from DJ Steve Boyett. These weekly podcasts feature free music mixes for an hour of workout time, either for running or interval training. You can subscribe to Podrunner directly through iTunes or another service, or use the new iPhone/iTouch app to get to the music directly.
If you use iTunes, just click on the Podcasts tab in the iTunes Store to find thousands of possibilities.
Search a podcast directory site such as Podcast Alley, Podcast Bunker or Podcast.com to look for podcasts on particular subjects.
If all that fails, use your favorite search engine to look for “a subject of your choice” AND “podcast” and you’ll turn up more results than you’d thought possible. For instance, check out a podcast on hockey, knitting or travel.

North Carolina's tax credits for film and television production are set to expire at the end of this year, and some Republicans in the General Assembly will take their marching orders from the John Locke Foundation, which hates Hollywood and hates Hollywood's money flowing into the state. In fact, the sock puppets working for the John Locke Foundation claim that the state's "film incentives" produce a "negative budgetary impact."
A new, non-Pope funded study of the film industry in North Carolina by Robert Handfield of the North Carolina State University’s Poole College of Management found this:
Beginning in 2007, when the incentive was first enacted, through 2012, the film and television industry has spent $1.02 billion in the state and generated a projected $170,000,000 in tax revenue. The cost of the credit over the same time period was $112,000,000. The result means that, for every dollar of credit issued, the industry generated $9.11 in direct spending and contributed $1.52 in tax revenue to North Carolina. (Hattip: WRAL)

Search Engine optimization (SEO) can be achieved on WebPaper.co for what we call “ON-SITE SEO”. The icon known as page properties, lets users set their website title, meta keywords, and meta description as well as the FAV icon. All this will help search engines understand what your website is about, so you will get the traffic your trying to target.
You want users who care about what you have to talk about, or what items you might be selling. Why be ranked for something you don’t want to be, and get traffic from people looking for something else. All that will do is hurt your website ranking and conversions but also give you false statistic data from users to see what you might be able to improve on so users stay longer.
Plus when you ask people in today’s market to find the best deal on a product or service, the first place they will go is Google.com or another search engine. So be sure to add your website title, meta description and meta keywords as this will ensure search engines know just what to place you under.
Also in Search Engine optimization (SEO) keyword density matters, so be sure not to over use a keyword like a robot. But do try to use it as often as you possibly can, do keep in mind duplicate content as well. Search engines like Google.com and many others will punish you or lower your rank for doing this. It means to simply copy and paste content another website is using, and placing that content on your website. The correct way to go about doing something like this, should be to re-write the content in your own words. This will not only help you rank better in search engines, but also you will notice some websites just seem to ramble on about nothing.

Optimizing your website can become very frustrating and time consuming. If you follow these basic guide lines it will detour you away from this frustration and hair pulling.
What is Search Engine Optimization – Search Engine Optimization also known as SEO is Bettering your website(s) for higher search results for certain key phrases in your market. By having high search results you then have more traffic to your website.
Getting started is the hardest part in all this. First part is research, research is key to the success and longevity of your web pages success.
Our market research, this is most time consuming parts (besides creating content). Find your direct competition. To do this go to multiple search engines such as “Yahoo, Google, Bing, Ask, ect.” and type in your keyword/phrase your attempting to gain popularity for.
Our example here is “Babysitter”, now “Babysitter” is a very board for location defining returning 103,000,000 results. Lets try “New York BabySitter”, google returned 14,100,000. Inserting a location brings less competition and a easier market (88,900,000 less competing websites!)
So far we went from “Babysitter” to “New York Babysitter” to “Manhattan Babysitter”. Lets now mess with plural instances. 4,510,000 results from Google for “Manhattan Babysitters”, its more =(. In our case less competition the better!
You can use the Google keyword Tool to compare searches of keywords and phrases. You can read more on how to use the Google Keyword Tool here.
Content is KING! But only if it is not stolen (copy and pasted). Stay on subject (if you have a website about cars, stick to cars don’t start talking about baseball.).
What is content? Content is anything that someone can access via the internet. (Images,Videos, Text, Audio, Files)
Doors are your content, the more doors you have the higher potential traffic you may have. Try and write as much text content as possible, of course adding images, videos and audio segments are a plus. Currently images and text are the top searched things on the internet.
Quality content is a MUST, copy and pasting is a NO NO! DO NOT COPY AND PASTE your content, not only is it not right (without giving credit/getting permission) you are majorly hurting your future results.
Search Engines will and are penalizing for duplicate content. For example lets say two websites are found in the search engines directory with the same results, it will only display one of the two. Thus being one website missed out indefinably. How that is determined is unknown, but off speculation its due to better “SEO” practices on one of the two websites. The better one stays, and the other one goes.
Keyword density (How many times your using your keyword; human like instances not (cars, cars, cars, cars) should look like (Our cars come in all colors. Cars are my favorite hobby. I love cars so much even my wife likes cars.)

Fantastic news from the GANG Awards last night – Hornet Sound’s sound design for The Chinese Room’s “So Let Us Melt” was awarded Best Sound Design In A Casual / Social Game! Composer Jessica Curry also picked up Best Music In A Casual / Social Game and Best Music For An Indie Game. Congrats Jess and the Chinese Room team, and woohoo!

Game Audio Network Guild has announced the nominees for the 2018 GANG Awards and So Let Us Melt has received a total of 7 nominations, 5 for music and 2 for sound design. Here are the categories:

It’s been a super busy year for Hornet Sound, with 3 new VR projects, ongoing work on Fractured Space, sound design for a theme park ride and work on a yet-to-be-announced console indie title.
Released just yesterday, Shooty Fruity is a great VR shooter that pits you against waves of mutant fruit as you work the checkouts in Super Mega Mart. It’s colourful and chaotic and awesome fun. Developed by my good friends at Near Light and published by ndreams (PSVR / Oculus / Vive).
This was a really fun project to work on – a VR experience built around a song by electronic duo Chainsmokers for PSVR. The player remixes and augments the song while moving through, and manipulating, dreamlike environments, everything synchronised and mapped to the harmony of the song. It recently earned a Raindance award for best branded VR experience. Developed by Curve Digital in partnership with Sony Music.
Earlier in the year I teamed up with The Chinese Room to work on their Google Daydream VR experience So Let Us Melt. It was an ambitious and challenging project for such a relatively low powered platform, and the result is a unique science fiction fairytale, scored by BAFTA winning composer Jessica Curry. Developed by The Chinese Room and published by Google.
I created the audio for this new ride at Chessington World Of Adventures which opened in the spring. Ride created by Seeper for Merlin Entertainment.
Last but by no means least, I’ve continued to work on Fractured Space, Edgecase Games’ capital-ships-in-space epic, with updates released throughout the year, the most recent released within the last few hours! There’s plenty more to come from Fractured Space in 2018.

I haven’t been very good at updating this page recently, mainly because I’ve been working super hard on lots of exciting projects! So, here’s a quick roundup of my latest game projects.
In Autumn 2016 I contributed sound design for creatures, towers and heroes to Castle Creeps Tower Defence (Android, Outplay Entertainment).
My first VR project, VR Perfect (PSVR/Vive/Oculus, nDreams) released just before Christmas 2016 – a relaxation-oriented VR experience in 3 beautiful natural environments, so it involved lots of fun foley work recording foliage, sand, water and so on. I provided all of the sound design and audio programming.
Most recently I’ve produced the audio for electro pop superstars Chainsmokers’ VR experience based around their latest single “Paris” (PSVR, Curve Digital / Sony Music). Paris VR was showcased at this years South By Southwest and is released as a PSVR exclusive in the next few weeks. I provided all of the sound design, audio programming and, key to this release, interactive remixing.
This entry was posted in Projects and tagged games, music, programming, sound design, VR on April 21, 2017 by ciaranw75.
I teamed up with visual arts agency Seeper again recently to produce the audio for Chessington World Of Adventures’ latest attraction – the Gruffalo River Ride Adventure. Seeper’s visuals are stunning and it was a fascinating project. The ride opened in March 2017 and from what I’ve seen the kids are loving it!
Fractured Space left Early Access last month and since then the reviews have been coming in. The game’s going down really well! Our Metacritic score is currently 78. PC Gamer gave us 82%, saying “Fractured Space looks and sounds spectacular”. GodIsAGeek and Game Grin both awarded us 80%, and Gamewatcher a massive 90%! Eurogamer gave us a great write up too and their “Recommended” badge (they don’t give scores), calling out the “beautifully evocative” sound of ships warping into sectors.
Tonight and tomorrow night (30th/31st October 2015) at Lincoln Castle, the brilliant people at London art/technology studio seeper will be treating the crowds to a stunning projection, light and laser show, the finale of the Frequency 2015 digital arts festival. The show explores the impact of the Magna Carta (800 years old this year) in establishing rights and freedoms in Britain and further afield.
Seeper approached me to create the soundtrack to the show and it has been a truly unique project. Part animation soundtrack – a rollercoaster journey of images, sounds and music projected using seeper’s 3D projection mapping technology onto the castle’s ancient Lucy Tower. Part interactive audio installation – visitors can interact with zones in the castle grounds representing The One (the King, absolute power), The Few (the powerful elite), The Many (the rest of us, the 99%!), generating awesome laser and audio effects, even interactively performing parts of the soundtrack to the show. And a VR experience too!
It’s been a pleasure to work with such fantastic creative talent and such a special brief. Now let’s hope the weather holds up and the crowd enjoys the show!

This year I was a member of the jury for the Audio Achievement award at the games BAFTAs, and last night was the big night. Congratulations to the Creative Assembly audio team for their well deserved win for Alien: Isolation.
I thought Isolation was a great example of a game whose heart and soul was in its audio, they really did a great job.

The research group of Prof. Martin Zuschin, Department of Paleontology at the University of Vienna, Austria, has an open PhD position for candidates with a strong focus on palaeoecology of marine invertebrates. The successful applicant will be hired for 4 years as University Assistant (“prae doc”). The topics investigated in our group include the molluscan palaeodiversity and faunal gradients in the marine fossil record of Europe, temporal and environmental trends in the intensity of drilling predation, taphonomy and actuopalaeontology of benthic invertebrates, conservation palaeobiology, and the effects of marine anoxia. The PhD student would be working in a young, international team consisting of paleontologists and biologists. The main function of the university assistant will be the participation in research. Additionally we expect teaching, support of students, and help with external fund raising and administration.
We are looking for a person interested in undertaking a project in the field of stratigraphic palaeobiology, in particular using the excellent fossil record of Cenozoic marine molluscs of Europe to address large-scale palaeoecological problems. The Cenozoic history of Europe is characterized by a complex pattern of formation and demise of land barriers and seaways between semi-enclosed basins of the Paratethys and Mediterranean Sea, and their connections with the North Atlantic and Indo-Pacific realms. The quantitative collections of marine molluscs accumulated during our previous projects provide an excellent tool for quantitative studies examining the effects of these palaeogeographic shifts and Cenozoic climate changes on temporal and spatial trends in biodiversity and community structure. The candidate will be able to develop own ideas pertaining to the broad main focus of the project in cooperation with the supervisor and will benefit from the support of leading special! ists in molluscan taxonomy and stratigraphic palaeoecology. Vast collections of standardized samples are already available and will make it possible for the student to test preliminary hypotheses at an early stage of the project. Additional field work is planned.
The official announcement of the position can be found at the jobcenter of the University of Vienna. Applications including a letter of motivation (German or English) should be sent via Job Center to the University of Vienna (http://jobcenter.univie.ac.at) no later than 29.04.2014 (extension possible, please contact martin.zuschin@univie.ac.at) and be referenced to the identification number 4834. The contract is expected to start in June but can be postponed if necessary.

I’ve written more than a few times about the role that emotion plays in books, even technical books. Technical books such as Accessibility for Everybody: Understanding the Section 508 Accessibility Requirements are tough to write because they’re packed with emotion. The author not only must convey emotion and evoke emotions in the reader, but explore the emotion behind the writing. In this case, the author’s emotions may actually cause problems with the book content. The writing is tiring because the author experiences emotions in the creation of the text. The roller-coaster of emotions tends to take a toll. Three common emotions that authors experience in the writing of a book and that authors convey to the reader as part of communicating the content are apathy, sympathy, and empathy. These three emotions can play a significant role in the suitability of the book’s content in helping readers discover something new about the people they support, themselves, and even the author.
It’s a mistake to feel apathy toward any technical topic. Writers need to consider the ramifications of the content and how it affects both the reader and the people that the reader serve. For example, during the writing of both Python for Data Science for Dummies and Machine Learning for Dummies Luca and I discussed the potential issues that automation creates for the people who use it and those who are replaced by it in the job market. Considering how to approach automation in an ethical manner is essential to creating a positive view of the technology that helps people use it for good. Even though apathy is often associated with no emotion at all, people are emotional creatures and apathy often results in an arrogant or narcissistic attitude. Not caring about a topic isn’t an option.
I once worked with an amazing technical editor who told me more than a few times that people don’t want my sympathy. When you look at sympathy in the dictionary, the result of having sympathy toward someone would seem positive, but after more than a few exercises to demonstrate the effects of sympathy on stakeholders with special needs, I concluded that the technical editor was correct—no one wanted my sympathy. The reason is simple when you think about it. The connotation of sympathy is that you’re on the outside looking in and feel pity for the person struggling to complete a task. Sympathy makes the person who engages in it feel better, but does nothing for the intended recipient except make them feel worse. However, sympathy is still better than apathy because at least you have focused your attention on the person who benefits from the result of your writing efforts.
Empathy is often introduced as a synonym of sympathy, but the connotation and effects of empathy are far different from sympathy. When you feel empathy and convey that emotion in your writing, you are on the inside, with the person you’re writing for, looking out. Putting yourself in the position of the people you want to help is potentially the hardest thing you can do and certainly the most tiring. However, it also does the most good. Empathy helps you understand that someone with special needs isn’t looking for a handout and that they don’t want you to perform the task for them. They may, in fact, not feel as if they have a special need at all. It was the realization that using technology to create a level playing field so that the people I wanted to help could help themselves and feel empowered by their actions that opened new vistas for me. The experience has colored every book I’ve written since that time and my books all try to convey emotion in a manner that empowers, rather than saps, the strength the my reader and the people my reader serves.
Obviously, a good author has more than three emotions. In fact, the toolbox of emotions that an author carries are nearly limitless and its wise to employ them all as needed. However, these three emotions have a particular role to play and are often misunderstood by authors. Let me know your thoughts on these three emotions or about emotions in general at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.

I try to keep up with accessibility issues so that the content I provide is always as friendly as possible. With this in mind, I’ve used the title attribute for links and wherever else it might be needed for many years now. At one time, the title attribute was actually mandated to make pages accessible by organizations such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The attribute also makes an appearance in a number of my books, such as Accessibility for Everybody: Understanding the Section 508 Accessibility Requirements with full documentation as to the benefits of using it.
However, today I find myself having to take a new direction and actually tell people not to use the title attribute because it could potentially make pages less accessible. Part of the reason that the title attribute isn’t used anymore is that some people became confused about it and started using it for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) uses and that was never the point. A lack of browser support and all sorts of other issues added to the demise of the title attribute as a useful link feature. The point is that there is a reason for the title attribute, but no one was using it and people with special accessibility needs found ways around it. At one point, the screen readers I used actually did make use of the title attribute, but newer screen readers don’t. In fact, the new approach is to ensure that links contain enough text to ensure someone with a screen reader knows what they mean. It’s a situation where a specific programming technique didn’t get the job done so another technique is now in use—one that seems more natural and that people are actually using.
So, what cued me into the fact that the title attribute is no longer particularly useful? Well, I use WordPress to create blog posts and noted recently that they had removed the title attribute from the dialog box for creating links. For a while I was adding the title attribute in by hand because I really did feel I was making the page more accessible. However, after talking with a friend about the issue and experimenting with the latest screen readers myself, I find that the title attribute is one of those “also ran” features that simply doesn’t see use often enough to make it worthwhile using. The new strategy is to ensure you provide enough text as part of your link to ensure the link is clear all by itself (even if you need to hide part of that text from view). If you have a copy of one of my books that espouses the use of the title attribute, make sure you change your practice to match what the rest of the world is doing today. Let me know if you have any questions about the use of the title attribute at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.

I keep up with the technology used to help people live fuller lives when they have a special need in as much as is possible. Of course, even if I devoted full time to the task, keeping up with every innovation would be impossible. Still, I try to find articles and other resources that go along with some of the concepts I originally discussed as part of Accessibility for Everybody: Understanding the Section 508 Accessibility Requirements. I recently read a Smithsonian article that helped me better understand precisely where prosthetic technology will be going in the future. Hugh Herr has turned a terrible life experience into something incredibly positive by creating prosthetic devices that work more like the flesh and blood counterparts they’re designed to replace.
The technology described in the article is simply amazing. However, the article also underscores some of the underlying issues that anyone with a special need faces. People automatically think that anyone with a special need is somehow deficient or requires special treatment. Given the resources, training, and devices available today, most special needs people can live as if they don’t have a special need. In fact, as far as they’re concerned, they don’t have one. So, while the article does describe really cool technology and tells of the heroic battle fought by several people to live normal lives, it also tells of a society that just isn’t ready to understand how technology can level the playing field and what a desirable response to special needs people should be.
Which brings me back to my book. When readers write me about my book, they often miss the point. Yes, my book is designed to help developers create really cool applications. It’s also designed to help people understand their legal and moral responsibilities in helping people with special needs. A few readers even get the idea that they’re likely to require special aids at some point in their lives. However, almost everyone misses the the point that I wrote my book to help people, all people, feel acceptance for who they are—no matter who they might be or what their requirements are.
Forward thinking people like Hugh Herr really are important today because technology such as bionics have the potential to change how we view humans as a species. A recent MIT Technology Review article highlights where Dr. Herr is going and where he wants to take us. If he can realize his vision, the things we’ll be able to do boggles the imagination. More importantly, the loss of a limb will no longer be an impediment to doing anything at all. Perhaps the makers of The Six Million Dollar Man had it right all along.
Where do you think we’re going with technology designed to overcome special needs in a way that makes them all but invisible? More importantly, what do you feel are the changes society needs to make with regard to treatment of special needs people? Let me know your thoughts at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.

A lot of my posts discuss the technical side of issues such as 3D printing. They’re a clinical treatment of a technical topic—devoid of sentimentality. Of course, this is a natural outcome of the kind of writing that I do. Most of my books contain accessibility aids in them because I strongly believe in the power of the computer to level the playing field for those who need a little extra help to be productive. Some of the things I’ve seen during my career have just amazed me and I’m sure that I’d be even more amazed were I to see it all. However, the technology I present is often faceless and lacks that human touch that really is needed to convince people about the validity of using technology to make life easier for those around us. That’s why a recent Parade article, How 3-D Printing is Transforming Everything from Medicine to Manufacturing, struck such a chord with me.
No longer is the technology faceless. You hear about how 3D printing has helped a real little girl live a normal life. The look on Anastasia Rivas’ face tells the whole story. It’s the same look that I’ve seen before when people’s lives are transformed by accessible technologies and it’s the same look that continues to drive me to cover accessibility in every book I write, in every way I possibly can. For me, technology isn’t about games or productivity software; it’s about making a difference in people’s lives—helping them do more with every asset they have. It’s the reason that I’d love to see fully secure, ultimately reliable, and easy to use software sometime in my lifetime, even though such a goal seems absurdly unrealistic today.
The point of this post is that the software you develop has real implications for real people. There is a tendency by developers to view software as an abstraction—as something that simply exists. In fact, there is a tendency to view software simply as a means to an end, but software and the hardware it runs on is so much more. I usually leave out the specific “who” part of an article to help you better concentrate on the technology you’re using. However, after seeing the Parade article, I just had to say something about a specific person affected by the technology that we all use and create as developers.
When you write software, make sure you consider the specific “who” of that software. Specifically who will use the application and what are the needs of that specific person? It’s a question we all need to answer despite the tendency to view software in the abstract. Let me know your thoughts about the human face of technology at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.

The title for this post is dramatic on purpose. In my book, Accessibility for Everybody: Understanding the Section 508 Accessibility Requirements, I describe all sorts of useful technologies for making the lives of those with special needs better. In fact, this particular book has received so much attention that I’ve expanded its coverage significantly by devoting forty (and counting) posts to it. The fact is that implanted devices will continue to be a part of our lives and their use will only increase, which is why articles, such as Cyber crime: First online murder will happen by end of year, warns US firm, have me more than a little concerned. The fact is that we’re all in line for a major wake-up call at some point if something isn’t done to secure the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems we all rely on to connect devices to the Internet today. The hardware, software, and other functionality required to make everything happen is encapsulated in a technology known as the Internet of Things (IoT). Soon, everyone will know about IoT, but few people will know or understand the underlying SCADA systems that goes with it.
The part of the articles that I’ve read so far that intrigues me most is that politicians and others in the know have been disconnecting themselves from the Internet. Note the mention of Dick Chaney disconnecting himself from the wireless part of his implanted device in the aforementioned article. If the devices and their connections were secured, our former vice president wouldn’t be quite so worried. Unfortunately, the rest of us probably won’t be quite so lucky unless we refuse to have the devices implanted at all (which would seem to be a self-defeating stance to take). I’ve actually been discussing this issue for quite some time now. The latest significant treatment of the topic appears in my An Update On Special Needs Device Hacking post. I’ve also broached the topic in Determining When Technology Hurts. The point is that this issue isn’t new, but we certainly haven’t done anything about it.
Will it actually require a slew of front page news stories depicting people assassinated through their implanted devices for someone to get the idea that there are really awful people out there who would like to kill someone (anyone) with impunity? It seems to be the case. So, now we’re seeing stories about the event actually taking place sometime soon. Even if we don’t see someone killed, I can see a situation where people have money extorted from them by hackers who have gained illegal access to their implanted devices.
I’m all for the advancement of technology that has significant potential to help people. I’ve written more than a few posts on the topic. Helping people to walk, see, hear, touch, and have generally better lives is a great idea in my book. However, the time is long past for securing these devices in a meaningful way so that only those who really need access will actually get it. Just why there hasn’t been any legislation regarding this need is beyond me. Our politicians are obviously aware of the problem and have done the work required to protect themselves, but they don’t see to be in much of a hurry to protect their constituents.
Given what I’ve seen in the past, I’m sure the medical community won’t be in any hurry to secure these devices because security has been a legislated requirement in the past. With this in mind, what do you feel needs to happen with these devices to make them a better deal for those who need them? Let me know your thoughts about the lack of security for implanted devices and devices connected to IoT in general at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.

The question of just how robots will affect us in the future consumes quite a bit of my time because I’m so interested in how they can be used for good. For example, robots are currently used to fight fires and to keep humans out of inhospitable environments. We also rely on robots to build some of the goods we enjoy and as a result, there are fewer assembly line accidents today than there were in the past (the quality of the output is also increasing). In the future, you can count on robot technology to help you remain independent, rather than ending up in a nursing home. There are even cars that rely on robots to drive them today and if things turn out as I expect, everyone will eventually use this sort of vehicle because robots will actually follow the traffic laws and reduce accidents as a result. In fact, it’s not too surprising to think that robots will appear in a lot of different situations that you don’t see them in today.
Humans are afraid of change. So, I’m also not surprised to find reports online that range from robots stealing jobs to terminator type robots killing us all off in order to save us (as in I, Robot). The fact is that robots really are under our control and as long as we exercise even a modicum of judgement, things will remain that way. I’m not saying that we couldn’t create a terminator-style robot. Recent advances in chip technology make it quite possible that we could create such a robot, but it’s important to ask why we’d ever do such a thing. In order for a new robot to become successful, there has to be a commercial reason to develop it and no one is interested in creating a terminator to destroy the human race.
What I think is more likely to happen is that robots will become companions to humans—devices that are both willing and able to take the risk out of human existence. The reduction of risk is an essential element in the robot/human relationship. We’ll continue to increase our use of robots as long as we can see a significant benefit to our personal lives. For example, it would be nice if we could eliminate the use of nursing homes altogether—that people could continue to live in their homes using robotic assistance. And, because those robots would be dedicated to the humans they serve, the standard of caregiving would increase dramatically. Of course, we have to get used to the idea of talking to a mechanical contrivance. Wait, we already do that—just consider how people interact with applications like Apple’s Siri.
Of course, people are asking what humans will do in the future if robots take on all of the tasks we have them slated for. For better or worse, the human condition has been changing at an ever more rapid pace over the last several years. If you look at just one statistic, you’ll miss what I’m trying to say here. For example, humans now live to an average age of 80 in many areas of the world—the average age will only increase barring some major change. People have children later in life now and focus more on career during the early years. Schools focus on getting kids to college and the college courses are becoming more challenging. In short, the environment in which we live today will change significantly in the next 40 or 50 years—to the point that most people won’t recognize the future as being any part of the past.
The change that has grabbed my attention most though is how much technology is now incorporated into humans (and the pace is only increasing). Yes, most of the technology currently does things like help people walk—it meets accessibility requirements. However, it’s only a matter of time before the technology will be used to help extend life and potentially make humans better adapted at excelling at tasks that we can’t even imagine now. So the question isn’t one of robots stealing jobs or killing us off terminator style, it’s one of understanding that humans are changing is a significant way and we’ll actually need robots to excel in the future.

Author JohnPosted on September 19, 2014 September 11, 2014 Categories Accessibility for Everybody, Social Commentary, TechnicalTags Accessibility, Processor, Robot, Robotics2 Comments on A Question of Balancing Robot Technologies
A problem with computer interactions today is the inability of computer systems to understand the context in which something is said. Context colors the meaning of words so that a word with multiple meanings is quite clear to a human hearer, but nearly impossible for the computer to interpret. Before speech systems can truly take off, they must be able to interpret context far better than they do now, and that means being able to understand emotion. Even though such systems are a long way away, science fiction authors, such as Isaac Asimov, have long insisted that robots and other computerized systems that interpret spoken input will be able to understand emotional context at some point. In fact, the movie, I, Robot, makes this point quite clearly.
There is a new standard that has been introduced that will partly solve the problem, Emotion Markup Language (EmotionML). The standard provides a framework for describing emotion in a manner that a computer can understand. It provides a framework for future technologies, but doesn’t actually provide a technology that you can use today. A Speech Technology article provides a good overview of EmotionML that you can use to summarize what it does.
I imagine that some people are wondering why we don’t simply use something simple like an emoticon to express emotion. After all, people have used them for quite some time to express emotions as part of e-mail. The problems with emoticons are that they don’t convey enough information and they’re also used tongue-in-cheek in many cases. In addition, even though some simple emoticons are standardized, there are many versions of emoticons that supposedly express the same emotion, which would make interpreting them nearly impossible.
Of course, it’s important to understand what happens when a computer can finally interpret emotions well enough to put some speech into context. Well, for one thing, fewer people will be throwing their computers out of windows when they get frustrated with the computer’s idiotic responses to input that was clearly not meant to be processed in a certain way. However, what is more important is that the computer will correctly interpret the spoken word more often. When words have a whole list of meanings, just knowing the emotional context can help a computer select the correct meaning and react appropriately—reducing user frustration and defusing situations before they deteriorate into some sort of unexpected action.
The important thing to remember is that the EmotionML standard is only a framework, not a technology. When the technologies based on this standard start to appear, you can be certain that vendors will want to put a particular spin on the product to differentiate it from other products out there. The technologies won’t work well together at first and there is going to be a lot of confusion on the part of humans and computers alike. However, at least it’s a start in the right direction.
What other kinds of contextual information does a computer require to interpret the spoken word with greater accuracy? I think one of the next standards will need to address body language, likely starting with facial expressions, but I’d like to hear your opinion. Send your thoughts on language context and how computers can interpret them correctly to John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.
A while back, over two years ago in fact, I uploaded a post entitled, “Examining the Calculator in Windows 7.” Since that time, a number of people have asked about the other features that the new calculator includes. Yes, there are these rather significant problems that Microsoft has introduced, but there are some good things about the new calculator as well.
The good thing appears on the View menu. When you click this menu, you see options at the bottom of the list that provide access to the special features as shown here.
The Unit Conversion and Date Conversion options are the most useful. However, the worksheets can prove helpful when you need them. Of the new features, I personally use Unit Conversion the most and many people likely will. After all, it’s not often you need to figure out a new mortgage, vehicle lease amount, or the fuel economy of your vehicle (and if you do such work for a living, you’ll have something better than the Windows Calculator to use). To see what this option provides, click Unit Conversion. You see a new interface like the one shown here:
You start using this feature by selecting the type of unit you want to convert. As you can see from this list, the kinds of conversions you can perform are extensive:
The option you select determines the content of the From and To fields. For example, if you want to convert from kilometers to miles, you select the Length option. After you select the type of unit, type a value in the From field and select the From field unit of measure. Select the To field unit of measure last. Here is what happens when you convert 15 kilometers to miles:
I’ve found use for most of the entries in the types list at one time or another. Every one of them works quite well and you’ll be happy they’re available when you need them. The Data Calculation option can be similarly useful if you work with dates relatively often, as I do. However, I can’t see many people needing to figure out the number of days between two dates on a regular basic. Even so, this feature is probably used more often than any of the worksheets.
The ability to perform conversions of various kinds and to access the worksheets that Windows 7 Calculator provides isn’t enough to change my opinion. The implementation of the Calculator is extremely flawed and I stick by my review in the first posting. However, you do have the right to know there are some positives, which is the point of this post. Let me know your thoughts about Calculator now that you have a better view of it at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.
Robots will eventually become a part of our society. In fact, in many ways they already are. It may not seem like a very auspicious start, but products from iRobot like the Roomba are already making their way into many homes. The Roomba will clean your floors for you without ever complaining. It started with a vacuum system, but now I notice you can get a Roomba for mopping too. The point is that robots will very likely continue to enter homes to perform less skilled work.
Then again, there is a pressing need for certain kinds of skilled help. Japan is hoping that Softbank’s Pepper will help address a continuing problem of finding someone to help the elderly. In fact, finding people to act as caregivers to the elderly is going to become a problem in many areas of the world where the birth rate is decreasing and the average age is increasing.
For me, robots have always been an answer to the pressing needs of those with special needs. I’ve always seen computer technology as a means of leveling the playing field for everyone. A properly configured computer can make it possible for someone to earn a living and live independently, but simply having a computer or a computer with a robotic arm isn’t enough for everyone. Autonomous robots that can call for help when needed will make it possible for people with greater needs to remain independent and well cared for by an entity that will never get frustrated or lose patience with them. When a human caregiver is needed, they can simply take over the robot and help the patient from a remote location until help can arrive.
As with any scientific endeavor, there are those who are impatient to see something more substantial arrive. Some are even asking why robots haven’t become better integrated into society yet. The days of I Robot and The Bicentennial Man are a long way off yet (even with Robin Williams’ brilliant presentation). The fact is that interaction with an environment is far more complex than we ever thought (making it easier to appreciate just how much the human body can do, even when less than perfect). However, robots are making progress in other areas. For example, one robot recently repaired another, which is an exciting advancement.
I think it’s good that adoption of robot technology is going slowly. There are many social and political issues that must be addressed before robots can become part of society. People need to understand that robots aren’t a threat and there need to be laws in place to address the use of robots in society. More importantly, we need the wisdom required to use robot technology efficiently and safely.
There is no doubt that robots will continue to become part of society and that they’ll play a greater role performing menial tasks and in helping people become more independent in their later years. The potential for robots to truly help society is great, but there are equally terrifying outcomes if we simply rush the technology to market without proper safeguards. What is your take on robots? Let me know at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.

I keep looking for useful, practical, wearable technology and Google Glass isn’t it. In fact, most of the wearable technology I read about hasn’t impressed me even a little. The problem is that most of this technology has no practical value. At best, it distracts people who are already so distracted that they do things like walk right into fountains while texting. As far as I’m concerned, these people don’t need even a small distraction, much less a major distraction like that provided by Google Glass.
However, Google is working on a practical, useful, wearable technology that apparently isn’t generating much press at all—a smart contact lens for diabetes patients. The new lens monitors a patient’s glucose levels continuously through tears. Instead of having to take readings several times a day (and still missing potential high or low readings), the lens would make it practical to monitor blood sugar continuously. There are technologies currently available that do monitor blood sugar constantly, but they’re inconvenient, restrictive, and uncomfortable. This technology promises to make it possible to monitor blood sugar without disturbing the patient’s daily routine. In fact, with the right configuration, a diabetes sufferer would live pretty much a normal life except for the need to take medications as needed to control blood sugar.
There are other health-related wearable technologies on the horizon. For example, there is Samsung’s Simband that monitors heart rate, blood pressure, and a number of other readings. A device of this sort could make it possible for people with serious health problems to get out of their homes and lead lives that are closer to normal.
Unfortunately, all of these wearable technologies are still in the planning, research, and development phases. Until practical devices appear on the scene, I’ll continue to view wearable technology as yet another disruptive toy with the potential to cause real harm to the wearer. Let me know your thoughts about wearable technology at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.

In general , CampusCamp is a BarCamp for educational institutions, targeting specifically the people inside the educational institution itself, such as undergraduates, postgraduates, staff, and lecturers. The goal is to get these people to start sharing whatever they know, love, or doing.
Not much. The only major difference is the target audience. CampusCamp target only members inside the educational institution itself. External audience are allowed to attend, however, only if the college allows it, and CampusCamp will limit the number of sessions available for talks given by external people.
The reason of the limit is so that we could give way for more talks by the members of the educational institutions itself. It is also to make it easier for the students who are organizing CampusCamp to handle the audience.
CampusCamp primary goal is to nurture the culture of sharing inside educational institutions. By encouraging sharing, we hope give birth to local special interest groups, increase communication and relation between students and staff with regard to knowledge, who knows, probably we'll raise the average quality level of graduates and the college too.
Considering CampusCamp idea comes from a FOSS person, its a deception to say that there are no FOSS agenda here. Through nurturing the culture of sharing inside colleges, we also hope that some the special interest groups which might got born through CampusCamp are related to FOSS in one way or another. We hope these people will be the new groups of contributors in the FOSS world and ecosystem, increasing the amount of contributors in this region.
The very first CampusCamp was held last Saturday (19th Nov 2011) at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS. It was a trial run for the team who are inside that college, so its was a small poorly promoted event. We managed to get 15 attendees which consist of a group of students, a group of alumni, and interestingly, 1 technician, with 8 talks presented.
It was a good trial run and the team seems to kind of get the hang of it now. The next CampusCamp UTP is tentatively scheduled on February or March 2012.
Anybody can organize a CampusCamp. Our logo, name an format are open for anybody to use as long as it follow the spirit of CampusCamp and BarCamp. If you are a student in any educational institutions, it would be great if you can organize one at your place. Visit the CampusCamp site at http://campuscamp.org for more details and guide on how to organize your own.

More than one hundred years of book reviews and essays on literature from the pages of The New York times book review. With dust jacket.
Gospel music sensationalize today’s churches into social and political irrelevance; and how the economic policies espoused by the religious right betray the same biblical tradition they claim to hold dear.
"Rev. Sekou is one of the most courageous and prophetic voices of our time. His allegiance to the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. is strong and his witness is real. Don't miss this book!" -Cornel West, Professor of Religion, Princeton University
Going beyond the traditional and more common approach of analyzing rap lyrics, from film, dance, to virtual reality, Religion and Hip Hop takes a fresh approach to exploring the paranoid posture of the religious in popular cultural forms, by going beyond what "is" religious about Hip Hop culture.
In Not Alone, she opens up her life to offer the hard-won wisdom that she’s obtained as she’s wrestled with God and depression. While avoiding easy answers, she shares the struggles she has faced, in order to give hope to those who deal with similar challenges, so that they will be better equipped to explore and reflect on their own experiences and faith. Above all, she writes to let them know that they are not alone.
"This book is a sampling of several writings published during my first two years as pastor of Mt Helm. Similar to books published by Martin Luther King, Jr., this text reflects my vision for Christian leadership, especially pastoral leadership, for such a time as this. Engaging, challenging, and faithful, these writings seek to remind the Church that it is God's hope for the world."
This was a tricky one only as the far as I could make out the original Rolls Road School, Rolls Road, also extended into then Marlborough Road now Marlborough Grove & I think they still do, I have seen it addressed with both roads. I have posted here simply because the Phoenix School address now is given as Marlborough Grove.
Rolls Road Junior School, Rolls Road, 1937, the whole area was redeveloped in the 1960s. Rolls Road School rebuilt as Eveline Lowe School in 1966
Transformation of the former Eveline Lowe Primary School in Marlborough Grove, just off Old Kent Road. into the Phoenix Primary School, 2012.
Like all alumni of De La Salle University, I was ecstatic last October 11 when in a heart-stopping game, the Green Archers won the UAAP men's basketball championship for 2013 after a long drought during which its arch rival Blue Eagles reigned for five consecutive years. I enjoyed every second of the last ten minutes which I watched since when the game started I was still on board a plane from Cagayan de Oro. The excitement reminded of a similar day last August when I watched with some friends the finals of the Gilas Pilipinas championship in which the Philippine national team lost to the Iranians, although accomplishing the almost impossible feat of qualifying for the world championship to be played in Madrid in August 2014. There is no question that basketball is by far the most important national sport in the Philippines.
My usual optimistic nature, however, is hard put in overcoming my fears that we will not go very far in Madrid. Although I will pray that the Philippine national team will reach at least the quarter finals when they play with the giants (literally) in the Spanish capital, the final words of President Benigno Aquino IV at the end of the Iran-Philippine showdown keep ringing in my ears: "We don't have seven footers." Yao MIngs, Pau Gasols and LeBron James' are still very rare among our male population. Sounding like a broken record, I state once again that, in contrast, below six footers like Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta, Xavi Hernandez, and Neymar da Silva Santos exist by the millions in our country. These liliputans are among the best football players in the world today since height is not necessarily an advantage in the beautiful game. That is why the best news in the sports world that I have heard recently is that some lucky children from 6 to 14 years old from all over the Philippines and Asia will receive one of the best Christmas gifts this coming Yuletide season: they will be trained by coaches coming from arguably the best football club in the world, FC Barcelona.
This news was an antidote to the depressing information that the Philippine Olympic Committee denied the request of the Philippine Football Federation to send a youth team to the Asian Football Cup championship in Myanmar next year. I am glad that the bad news has been converted into an opportunity by our local football enthusiasts. With the leadership of the PFF under President Mariano Araneta, all the stakeholders of football are resolved to wage a grassroot campaign to spread the playing of football far and wide, in as many Philippine regions as possible and among as many social sectors, including street kids in the most depressed areas and special children like those with the downs syndrome. What was started by three embassies (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile) is spreading to many more embassies. There is now an Embassy Cup in the making in which football teams made up of street children from the slum areas of the Metro Manila will play against one another after each of the teams is coached by the personnel of the various foreign embassies, assisted by NGOs and academic institutions. My university, the University of Asia and the Pacific, is one of the moving forces in this initiative.
What is this Christmas package that will benefit some 200 children come December 18 to 22, 2013? The training academy of FC Barcelona--FC Barcelona Escola--returns to the Philippines after a very successful football camp last April 2013 in which 148 children of 17 different nationalities obtained world-class training from coaches coming from FC Barcelona Escola. These fortunate children learned much more than just football skills. They imbibed virtues of cooperation, modesty, honesty, respect for others, hard work, discipline and the other human qualities for which the tiki-taka style that the Catalan booters learned from the Dutch is famous. If FC Barcelona continues to dominate Spanish football, despite three changes of managers over the last three years, it is because a culture of cooperation and solidarity has been institutionalized through rigorous training that starts from childhood. Even among ordinary players, children as young as two or three years old can already be initiated in the skills and styles of football, something which is difficult to do in other sports except swimming.
Parents who are interested in the Football Camp this coming December 18 to 22, 2013 may get in touch with the organizers, Nicholas Reyes and Michael Reyes at 0917 566 9739 and 0917 596 1624 or landline (632) 217 8771. They may also log on for more information to www.fcbscolaphilippines.com. FCBEscola International will send two coaches who will be assisted by six trained local coaches who are able to integrate with the language and culture of the Philippines. While the FCBEscola coaches are here, they will also spend time improving the skills of local coaches for the benefit of the many football family clubs that are mushrooming in Metro Manila and suburbs as well as other Philippine cities. This welcome initiative of FCBEscola in partnership with the local football club called TeamSocceroo can meet the needs of the increasing number of young people in the Philippines who are shifting their attention from basketball to football. This augurs well for the long-term sustainability of the Philippine National Football League that is scheduled to start in 2016, just a year after the launching of the ASEAN Economic Community. Within the ten-country ASEAN, the Philippines at the moment stands out like a sore thumb as the only country where football is hardly played by the masses. In all our nine ASEAN neighbors, football is the national passion. It is about time that we, at least in sport, look more like our Asian neighbors rather than a clone of the United States.

A warm welcome back to all of our returning students! As usual we haven’t been resting on our laurels during the long summer break, and we’ve made a few changes since June…
Single Sign On. Over the summer we’ve begun work on streamlining access to our electronic resources by moving away from Athens authentication to a single sign on process using the University username & password. The project is ongoing and so you need to be aware that there are:
Self Collection of Hold Requests. We have started storing hold requests on the shelves in the High Demand section on Level 3 so that users can collect them and issue them without having to ask for them at the main desk. This only applies to our stock – Inter Library Loans will still be stored in the office behind the desk.
It’s very easy to use – books can be found in alphabetical order on the shelves filed under the first three letters of the user’s surname and the last three numbers of their ID. For example, our own Matt Cunningham would be CUN331. Where a user only has two letters in their surname, just use those two letters followed by the last 3 digits of their ID number.
New Decor. All the old workstation desks on Levels 1 & 2 have been replaced with new ones. We’ve added plasma screens displaying booking details outside of every Group Study Room in the Library, and the Help Desk on Level 4 has been removed to expand the study area.
Wifi Upgrade. IT Services completed their upgrade of the Wifi coverage throughout the building, so hopefully you won’t encounter any more dead spots!
Oh yes – and as you can see from the picture above, we had the Red Arrows fly over for the Graduation Ceremony. As the old police recruitment poster used to say – “Dull it isn’t!”
Posted in Borrowing, Building Work, Databases, E-Journals, Electronic resources, IT, Library, Resources, Service Announcements, Study spaces
On Monday 25th June and Tuesday 26th June work begins on replacing the workstation desks on Levels 1 & 2. This will necessitate the temporary removal of all of the PC workstations from these floors, including the Catalogue and Short Stay PCs.
All of these machines will placed into storage in Group Study Rooms 1A and 2A, which will mean that these rooms will be unavailable for booking while this work is carried out.
Week beginning Monday 2nd July the old desks will be removed from Levels 1 & 2 for removal by University Facilities Management – this may involve some noise and disruption, and the lift may be unavailable to visitors while the desks are being moved.
The new furniture should be delivered during the following week – again, this will involve some noise and disruption. Once this is completed, IT Services will remove the PCs from storage and begin setting them up on the new desks.
Access to the shelving and other facilities on Levels 1 & 2 will remain unaffected, however there will be no PC workstations available to use on either floor while this work is completed. Workstations are still available on Levels 3 & 4, and staff are available to assist with catalogue searching at our Enquiry Desks.
As term officially ends this Wednesday it’s an opportune time to remind people that from next Monday, 25th June, the Library will be switching to its vacation opening times schedule. This is:
Please note that, as usual, our only late(ish) evening opening is on Wednesday nights, and that we are closed entirely at weekends for the duration of the vacation. Also, please remember that last entry to the Library is ten minutes before closing time, in order to allow staff to clear the building.
The IT Services PC Clinic in the Library is open throughout the summer, but only during the hours 11am-3pm. Outside these times the IT Services Help Desk can be contacted 8.30am-5pm (week days only).
The Library Shop will be closed for the summer, but the Library Café will remain open, 9am-4pm daily.
As usual during the vacation we will be catching up with a few out-of-season maintenance jobs around the building; we will keep everyone posted here and on our usual social media channels of when & where these will be taking place to minimise any potential disruption to visitors.
Due to essential maintenance, the Library lift will be out of action between Monday 19th March until Wednesday 21st March.
Library staff will be available to help out if you are unable to access the lower floors over these three days.
The building work on Level 3 has now been completed and we are now the proud possessors of a brand new collection of very comfortable little study booths out on Level 3, in the area where the printers used to be.
On Monday 10th July work will commence on improving the traffic flow on the University Road outside the Library. Constructors will be making a new passing place for traffic as well as widening the existing bus stop.
The road will remain open while this work is carried out, but traffic management will be in use at times.
Throughout July work will be proceeding on repairing and improving the air conditioning system in the Library. This work will be mostly taking place in the Library’s engineering plant room, but it is likely to involve some noise and disruption and there may be days when the air conditioning system to Levels 2 and 3 will need to be switched off for a time.
We will keep you up to date with any progress, and apologise for any inconvenience caused (particularly in this heat!).
On Monday 3rd July work will commence on relocating the printer/copier area in the middle of Level 3. This will involve the removal of the printers and the knocking down of the screening walls surrounding their location.
During this work a significant proportion of Level 3 will be unavailable to visitors, though access will still be open to the PC Clinic, the Seminar Rooms and Training Room 1. The printers from this area will also be unavailable for use during this time – if you need to print, photocopy or scan documents, alternative machines are still available on Levels 1.2 and 4.
This work will involve some noise and disruption. We apologise in advance for any inconvenience this may cause.
The University will be holding Open Days on Friday 30th June and Saturday 1st July. Visitors, students and staff should be aware that campus, and in particular the Library, will likely be extremely busy on both days.
As usual the Library will be hosting several displays and stands by other support services within the University on both days, and they will be taking up temporary residence this week on Level 3. As such, certain study areas on this level will be unavailable during this time and will be cordoned off from public use.

On Wednesday 5th April University Facilities Management will begin work on replacing the mains cold water main between Telford Hall and Wolfson. While this work is carried out, the water supply to the Library will be turned off. Alternative arrangements have been made to provide an alternative source of water to the building so users should not be unduly effected – however, these circumstances may change, and we shall inform users of any developments through our usual social channels.
This work is due to begin by 9am and it is anticipated that it will be completed by 6pm, though it is hoped the Library supply will be reconnected within a few hours.

This is actually out of sequence - I wrote it a few weeks ago and didn't like it, now reading it back I don't hate it so much...
The work I'm going to use as a context for the Learning Design study is something I'm currently actively engaged in - partly the save time (in the hope I can use the material made and build on experience of delivery) and partly to make the project more authentic. I don't teach much day to day, and I very rarely work for an extended period with the same group - so this is a good focus.
For the Conceptualise section - the first of the seven deadly Cs of the 7C model - I must consider why and what I want to design, key principles and pedagogical approaches and demographics and needs.
What I'm designing is a course for in-service teachers, mostly working in primary schools, to support their "delivery" of computing in the English national curriculum. As most of the programme is known to this audience from the old IT curriculum, the focus naturally resides on the programming elements. It tends to be an area where teachers haven't had instruction in the actual skills themselves to code and where they may lack confidence in classroom management and assessment as well.
Although several full days of training would be ideal, it will never happen. The course needs to be structured in such a way that minimal face to face training will take place because to offer this design at a scale that is meaningful (covering 25+ schools) nothing else is affordable.
To gain confidence requires people to have done more than master content - they need to experience programming to have the capacity to teach it.
There is a wide range of levels of experience (as teachers) and settings (as schools) for the audience, so they will need a way to work together to adapt the approaches offered to apply the material for themselves.
Knowledge of what is required: associative approaches presenting content, giving feedback on understanding, coupled with a community of practice to share understanding and tease out subtleties as a group.
Learning how to program: is something I can only see being successful through very constructivist, hands on, problem solving activity. Learning by doing and reflecting and sharing thereon. The outcomes, user generated content and collaboration for members of the community of practice to help resolve problems together.
Considering how to teach programming: is very much a dialogic process with colleagues, having understood what needs to be taught to their classes and mastered some of the skills (and experiences) involved, consider how to frame this in their own teaching. I'd see elements of situative and connectives pedagogy in this phase.

Many people assume a green juice is for other people. They claim they don’t like veggies. They fear the poison-colored concoction will taste even worse than it looks. They think die-hard green juicers seem nutritionally elitist and willing to compromise their taste buds in the name of super fuel.
While there is definitely a spectrum of green -- from beginner to advanced -- there is a place for you somewhere along the line. I promise. And I’m encouraging you to join the party, because nothing bad happens when people add more whole green foods to their diet. Nothing. Zilch.
There are a few ways to go about getting more greens into your diet, and I promise they’re way easier than you think. Best part? You don’t even need a fork. You only need a straw.
1) Hop on the green juice train. If you want to make your own juice, you’ll need a juicer but not necessarily the fanciest one on the market. Juicing is a process that extracts the liquid from whatever you put in it, and it leaves all the pulp out of your cup. The pulp is full of beneficial fiber, but if pulp isn’t your thing, you still get plenty of vitamins and minerals from drinking just the juice. Not into cooked broccoli, kale, collards or spinach? You may like them better in a raw juice. Sometimes the flavors are milder when raw and combined with other ingredients.
Immediately after the juice is made, it starts losing its nutritional powers, so you’ll want to grab a straw STAT. Green juice is sensitive to time (how long from when it was made until it is consumed), temperature (heat can diminish some of the vitamin potency) and storage (air and clear glass containers can also make the juice less potent). But even not-so-fresh juice is better than no juice at all, so don’t let this deter you. Just make sure to put in the fridge and drink within 24 hours if you’re not drinking as soon as you make it. Here’s a great beginner recipe if you’re just getting your feet wet:
2) Get your smoothie on. If you don’t have any more room on your kitchen counter for yet another appliance, then your handy blender is waiting for you to let it make a smoothie. A blender can’t separate the pulp from the juice, which is why by definition smoothies are thicker and well, smoother. The smoothie crowd is just as cool as the green juice crowd, and some would even argue smoothies are even healthier than juices because of that pulp stuff I mentioned.
My formula for the perfect smoothie is incredibly simple … 1 cup milk (cow’s, nut or seed-based milk), 1 fruit, a handful of greens, 1 healthy fat, an extra (call it a flavor wild-card) and protein powder.
One of my fave healthy fats is coconut because it’s loaded with health-promoting properties, flavor and, of course, healthy fats. The fat in coconut is mostly MCTs (medium-chain triglycerides) and although they are a type of saturated fat, they are not the same saturated fat as you’ll get from say fatty meat.
3) Add a green supplement to your drink. Think green juices and smoothies too much work for you? I’ve got you covered. At Life’s Abundance, we’ve created a Greens Blend that is jam-packed to the brim with nutrients. All you have to do is mix with water. Yep, it’s that easy. Add a scoop to water and mix. The Greens Blend is made of organic greens (picked at peak nutrient density) and an organic mushroom blend for overall health. The best part? It doesn’t have that I-just-ate-dirt-from-the-yard taste. It has a yummy, berry flavor. You can add to water, your morning smoothie, baked goods like zucchini muffins or even to yogurt. Most important, just drink up. Greens are the master of the health universe.
But, so many of my clients are still sailing past the avocado bin at the grocery store or grabbing powdered peanut butter instead of the real thing, all in an effort to avoid eating anything “fattening.”
Well, here’s the deal with fat, and listen closely. Consuming too much of anything will make us fat. But when you eat the right amount of food overall, fat by itself does not pack on the pounds. Studies have even shown low-fat diets can actually make that number on the scale CLIMB AND CLIMB!
Why do I love fat so much? It tastes good (think, guacamole), helps you absorb vitamins (yes, the dressing on your salad ACTUALLY helps you to absorb nutrients), helps you burn fat (it’s true, fat indeed burns fat!) and helps you to feel satiated after eating (i.e., keeps you feeling full). But, truth be told, not all fats are created equal.
Saturated and trans fats are both solid at room temperature (think lard and butter), but there is a big difference between saturated fat and trans fat.
Saturated fat has been labeled as a dietary no-no for a long time, but there IS room in your diet for it if you’re getting it from real, healthy foods like dairy, coconut … even dark chocolate.
Trans fat on the other hand is a definite diet devil. You’ll find it in packaged, highly processed foods that you already know you should be avoiding. Just no.
Now let’s talk about the angels of the fat world: monounsaturated fats (like those found in avocado, nuts and seeds) and polyunsaturated fats (also in nuts and seeds, as well as fatty fish). These “good” fats have been shown to have many, many health benefits! For more than a decade, the health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil have been studied by researchers all over the world.
You want to make sure you get enough of all these good fats - so stop avoiding the avocado bin already, and drop by the seafood counter for some salmon. In fact, salmon and walnuts in particular are two of the richest natural sources of omega-3s. If you’re not a flax, salmon or walnut junkie, a supplement could be just what you need to ensure you’re getting sufficient fat in your diet. I actually recommend an ultra-pure, ultra-concentrated Omega-3 Fish Oil Supplement to all of my clients as insurance.
Pet parents have asked me if dogs can experience depression. In almost every case, the question is prompted by troubling behavior and not just simple curiosity. Well, dogs can most certainly exhibit obvious signs of depression, such as loss of appetite or declining interest in previously enjoyed activities. And then there are symptoms not readily recognized as depressive: anxiety, fearfulness, aggression, various destructive behaviors and even hiding from people. Are these last signs indicative of depression, a complicated emotional disturbance, or do they point to something else altogether?
In humans, depression ranges from temporary episodes of sadness to severe, persistent clinical depression, which persists for significant periods of time. Both are marked by a depressed mood and a loss of interest and lack of pleasure.
Dogs are highly intelligent, emotional creatures. We know that they can read our facial expressions, learn complex commands, express fear and joy, and can get stressed, but can they be depressed? Behavioral scientists not only say ‘yes’, but are surprised by how prevalent depression is among canines. In fact, in a 2013 British study, scientists discovered something shocking … nearly one in four dogs in the UK was suffering from some form of depression.
Because we cannot simply ask our dogs if they’re depressed, how can we know for sure what’s going on? Well, the experts say, look to sudden changes in behavior which cannot be attributed to a medical problem. In such cases, depression offers the most logical rationale. But, on an emotional level, we also have our own sense of empathy as a guide. As pet parents, we often just intuitively know something’s up.
Canines often express signs of depression after loss of a family member, whether it’s a human or another animal. When someone close to a dog is no longer around, they can be listless, lose their appetite, be cranky, pace frantically, regress in house-training, sleep for even longer periods, and even develop destructive behaviors such as digging or chewing. Some dogs can develop anxiety-ridden behaviors, such as prolonged trembling, while others experience a significant change in personality (outgoing, becoming withdrawn and distrustful).
Some dogs can exhibit depressive behaviors if they don’t get enough exercise or attention. Even changes in routine, ranging from serious (loss of a caretaker) to the seemingly harmless (changing a pet’s bed) can result in the symptoms listed above.
Unfortunately, changes in behavior can signal an underlying medical problem. Painful conditions such as arthritis, pinched nerves, bladder infections, or gastrointestinal inflammation can elicit behavioral changes, and hormonal conditions such as hypothyroidism can mimic the signs of depression in dogs. If you notice any sudden changes in your dog’s behavior, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian. With a physical exam, and any necessary tests administered as warranted (such as blood work, urine testing and x-rays), your vet will be better equipped to determine potential causes and likely treatments.
Be intentional about the time you spend with your dog. Be prepared to dote on your pup, (yes, even more than usual!), and shower them with attention, like you would with a newly adopted dog.
Renew your commitment to exercise with daily walks … sunshine and fresh air can do wonders for both you and your dog. Plus, you’ll be adding a little adventure to your dog’s day. By taking long but unhurried walks, you allow your dog the time and space to roam a bit and smell all the scents. Remember, they can detect a whole host of odors, building timelines and creating mental maps of previous activity in any given spot … think of it like canine storytelling.
While at home, make sure your pup has plenty of good chew toys, and engage in some training sessions to stimulate positive mental activity.
In spite of all this, if your dog is still experiencing chronic depression, your veterinarian can recommend an appropriate medication to help manage, possibly even resolve, the illness. Your vet may recommend a consult with a board-certified veterinarian behaviorist. Certified by the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists, these experts are especially good at understanding such situations and knowing which pharmaceuticals will be most effective.
Have you ever known a canine who suffered from depression? How did you know? And what, if anything, were you able to do to help alleviate the condition? We’d really like to know about your experience, so please submit your comments below. You never know … something you share might mean the world to a pet parent searching for a solution, even if it’s simply the solace of knowing others have dealt with similar issues.
Charitable work is core to our mission of well-being for all. It’s so important to us that every order placed aids homeless animals. This work is done through the non-profit branch of Life’s Abundance, The Dr. Jane Foundation, which provides financial support to small and medium-size rescue groups who work to prevent animal homelessness, abuse and chronic neglect.
We made this commitment because we understand the need, which is so big, it’s almost hard to comprehend. But, like with all great endeavors, progress is made by focusing on the next task, taking it day by day.
In an era where so many shelters self-identify as “no kill”, it’s shocking to learn that euthanasia is still responsible for the deaths of nearly three million dogs and cats every year. And with between five and seven million entering shelters every year, it’s a percentage that’s way too high. That being said, in 1970, the number of dogs and cats being euthanized was north of 20 million, even though the total pet population was about half what it is today. Obviously, there’s still a lot of work left to do. But it’s incredibly worthwhile work … work that we earnestly, wholeheartedly support.
People involved in rescuing homeless, abused and neglected animals will tell you ... sometimes, their work comes down to doing the best you can when confronted by road blocks on all sides. And so many of the hardships these small non-profits encounter are linked, directly or indirectly, to a chronic lack of funding.
That’s why we dedicate a portion of our profits to our non-profit’s funding reserves. Since 2007, we’ve awarded funding to more than 100 deserving groups!
The rescue groups we support employ strategies that we know are effective. Most of our grant recipients utilize one or more programs that have proven successful in curbing pet overpopulation and reducing the number of pet kids euthanized. These initiatives include low-cost spay and neuter surgeries, TNR (trap-neuter-return) management of feral cat communities, affordable adoption fees, and community education efforts regarding the proper care of companion animals and the dangers of animal abuse and neglect. And all of this is done in addition to the day-to-day activities undertaken by these committed rescuers to place their animals in loving adoptive homes.
Time and time again, we’ve witnessed amazing transformations. Animals who have borne the brunt of cruelty or long-term neglect and yet, still were able to rise above circumstance and make full recoveries. Every new group brings its own stories of triumph in the face of adversity. With so many grant recipients, it’s hard to calculate the exact number of animals helped by our non-profit … but it’s easily in the hundreds, if not thousands!
One of the many animals helped by our non-profit, Faith was rescued by SW Collie Rescue. Our 2015 award helped restore her to health after a harrowing abandonment in the middle of the desert.
Just think, simply by shopping with Life’s Abundance, you’re making the world a better place. It’s a rare case where you can do something positive without doing anything different at all. As long as you keep purchasing Life’s Abundance products, you’ll be supporting the cause of rescue. So, while you're focused on your health, the well-being of your family, caring for your own companion animals ... while you're doing all that, you're also making life better for homeless animals and giving a helping hand to the people who operate on the front lines.
And we’ve saved the best news for last. Our Board of Directors just held a quarterly meeting in mid-February, approving grants to the following seven worthy recipients …
In the coming months, we will reveal just what these non-profits are able to accomplish with our funding. However much they are able to achieve will be in no small part thanks to all the supporters of The Dr. Jane Foundation.
Are you involved in an animal rescue, or know someone who is? We are currently accepting applications for 2016 funding. Our Board will be considering applications for the next round of funding in April, so try to have completed grant requests submitted by the end of March for immediate consideration.

So my stats are the same as they were last year I wear a size 12. My weight stays around 175 ….and I am stable. ( mostly..lol)
I started in a size 20-22 and I weighed 275. So a 100 pound weight loss is pretty good. I would like to get to 150. I am 5 foot 5 inches ( well it’s actually 4.5…but I am giving myself that half of an inch) and the charts say I am supposed to weight between 120-145 ..but charts are outdated and terrible. I have at least a medium bone structure..I am not petite and I think 15 is probably the lowest I can go safely. I also think i need to give myself some leeway just because I do have some loose skin that won’t go away without surgery. The more I lose…the worse it gets.
So again….as I stated before….I am so glad I had surgery. It has helped me in many areas of my life. I know that many people say it’s the easy way out…and in some ways it is….but in my case I still had to do the hard work. Nothing worth while comes easy. I will say that the statistics are absolutely true…that most people who have weight loss surgery gain their weight back. I have been watching that the whole 2 years I have been on this journey. I absolutely had to change my life…..lifestyle and everything in between.
People that love food so much, that don’t want to change their lives, For the people who say that “everything in moderation”, or “I still need to enjoy life” or that don’t have time to incorporate exercise in their lives. It won’t work. I had to change everything. Now to say I don’t indulge ..I would be lying. I do. I own it. But I also know that when I do I have to work out more and harder the next day. It’s just my reality. If I don’t ..the scale creeps up. It’s just the way it goes.
So the other thing I have learned on my journey ..that has mirrored so many other things in my life is that the journey never ends. IT NEVER ENDS. Yes…you just read that. I have discovered that nothing is conquered….nothing is ever truly resolved. You may have grasped a lesson….and learned something. But them once you apply that lesson that you just learned. You have to go through it all over again to get another lesson. Sometimes I am sick of those lessons, I am sick of having to go through everything again. This is so true of relationships, weight issues, life in general. But alas…..I am here. I have gained much wisdom in 2 years. I have lost 100 pounds. Then I maintained for a year. That is progress. I know that if I treat my body well and give it exercise and good fuel it will do it’s part to help me.
There are so many benefits of my weight loss it’s amazing how much my life is different. So last fall when a friend said she was disappointed that her friend backed out on a trip….A trip to walk 84 miles in England. The Hadrian’s wall walk..I was able to say..” I will go with you” without hesitation. Why? Because I can. My body can handle that type of walk. My body is strong, capable and ready because it’s not carrying around a hundred extra pounds anymore. By Golly! I walked my heart out and I didn’t really struggle, physically. I did train and I did well. I learned that I am not a Fast walker…but I am a consistent walker. I pretty much kept the same pace no matter the terrain. I was fast compared to some….but there were people WAY faster than I.
So what has that taught me? I have freedom. Freedom like I didn’t have before trapped in my body. I was tormented because I knew there were things I wanted to do and couldn’t. Here I am….doing them.
So now I am at another cross roads. I can either stay where I am…or I can push myself further. HMMM Let’s see who knows me…What do you think I will do?
I have said from the beginning of this that I absolutely HATE the gym. I do. I will find every excuse to avoid that place. I don’t really know exactly why…..I think it just represents all types of failures for me. So I have only been doing exercise that I know I will actually complete because I like it. Which consists of walking, jogging, hiking and swimming. Pretty limited.
Well I have heard many times that I need to build some muscle and cross train. I hate that. I honestly do. I wish I could be one of those people that like it. I am not. Here’s the other thing. I am completely and totally uncoordinated. I try aerobics and dance classes ect. I hardly ever pick up the routines because when I have to move more than one limb at a time and make them do things–> it’s a jumbled mess. No lie. Swimming took me a long time..and I am not expert. I talked about that before in another post. But I make it work. We all have different talents…..mine is not physical activity or knowing exactly how to make my body move. I would be the worst contestant on dancing with the stars.
Anyhow, I have decided to do some cross training. I have to change some things and obviously if I want more results I have to add some muscle. But I am not going to the gym. I am going to try to do this at home. I have been sticking to the 21 day Fix routine for 2 weeks now. Only one more week to go to see how I am doing. It’s 21 days of aerobics, weight lifting and what not. I pretty much wanted to die the first week. Every time I climbed my stairs or sat down ( and I drink a lot of water…TMI!) I would cringe inside. ( I am not following the meal plan or drinking the shakes…just doing the exercise videos. Although I am going to try a sampler of the shakes…just to see if I like them. I also hate protein shakes. LOL Apparently ..I hate lots of things when it comes to fitness…no wonder I was so over weight. Seriously.)
But this second week has been better. So I am trying. I think it helps that its only 30 minutes a day and I can do it in my livingroom. Since I don’t have to leave the house…I am more likely to stick to the plan. I still take Kali out for our morning walks & jogs. I just do a little less to balance the time.
So I will keep you updated on that progress …and hopefully I will have good news. Even if the scale doesn’t go down I would be happy with a few size drops.
I have plenty more blogs to write…so maybe I will go back to monthly updates on the weight loss journey ….just because it might be helpful to some.
If I find that magic dust that helps me love cross training …I will let you know. So far I suffer through the 30 minutes …just so I can get the results I am hoping for.
Hi Pat, I’m doing the 21 day fix work outs by Beach body. They are good. She has someone in the videos that always has a modified version of the exercises too…so I think every one can do them. Let me know if you want a link or something. I bought mine off of Amazon. But there is a whole Beach Body group with several coaches, videos ect. I’m just doing the basic one.
Wow Dear It really doesn’t seem like 2 years. You have gone thru a lot of ups and downs ,Happy and sad and everything in between. I am so happy for you you are coming out on the good side . Keep up the good work and keep us in the loop xxx Pat

First of all, double update weekend! Been too long since we've had one of those. Episode 367 on Friday, Episode 368 on Saturday. Enjoy.
Episode 367 debuts Bailey, Ashlyn, and Richard. It's a good one. Just to forestall what I'm sure would be a lot of inquiries, it is with the greatest regret that I tell you that Episode 367 is the only game I have (so far) with the insanely cute Bailey. Believe me, I wish it were otherwise.
Episode 368 closes out the series with Mo, Liilii, and Erica. As I said earlier, it's not one of my personal favorites, but fans of these ladies should enjoy it.
For this week's player promos, we'll start with a returning veteran. She's only been in two LostBets.com videos, and those were almost three years ago. From Episodes 198 and 201, please welcome back Kym.
As for today's newbie, there are two of them, and this is the reason for the freebie clip. Meet Dakota:
Now, unlike the United States, we can't have two Dakotas. We've had duplicate names before (as Asia M, Britney S, and Amber Heavens could testify) but I don't like doing it. So I did the obvious thing: I made them play a stripping game, with the loser having to give up the name. Wanna watch? Just click here to watch the whole thing. Enjoy!
Dakota and that other girl will be making their debut in Episode 369, which is why I didn't promote it last week. I didn't want to spoil the names of the competitors.
I can't believe no-one hasso far wanted to congratulate you on finding girls as cute as the Dakotas! Well done!
Big fan of the Dakota, now Brooklyn, here is hoping to some great games from these girls! Love to see them both lose some hardcore stuff.
Great job finding Dakota and (now) Brooklyn. Very promising. Could you perhaps tell us what they risk in episode 369?
This is the third or fourth week in a row that the members site got a rerun. I know this happened earlier this year as well. Is it a scheduling problem. All I know is that a month or so ago, several videos were pulled down off the member site and for the past few weeks they have been put back up as new. I hate to write and complain each week, but I do pay for new content. Can you fix it
@TrueS: As a matter of fact I do have an amateur shoot coming up. It's planned to include two girls who've never been naked on camera and two girls who've been on LostBets.com. But which forfeit do you mean? The pubic-shaving thing? If not, you'll need to be more specific.
@Joe: Both Dakotas have fairly liberal, open limits. For example, in Episode 369, they losers get facials.
@W: So, Episode 369 involves four girls (Dakota, Brooklyn, Selah, and Maddie) playing disc golf to two losers. They have to go down on two very willing guys (Conor and Richard), with both girls taking facials. Whoever doesn't get her guy off first also has to endure a spanking.
@James and @Anon 5:11 (please sign your posts): I've emailed the guy who runs lostbetsgames.com again. I don't know what the problem was: last I heard the duplicates were caused by a data glitch that had been fixed. @James, I certainly don't blame you for not continuing with your subscription. I'll keep you guys posted on what I heard back.
I Couldn't find this clip nowhere on the site? where do you see this is as dupe? if its a mistake and you prove me wrong i`ll release bonus video just for you for pointing this out.
We are here to make sure all members are always happy & satisfied and the last thing we would want to see is disappointed members, we do care and we always here and respond as fast as we can to any possible issues.
This clips were update at may or June. Later, I don´t know when, were deleted and added a new clips like
Aha i understand, i was not aware of this as i fired the guy who did the previous updates because of those issues.
I have an idea, maybe i`ll show you guys the whole list of future updates and you can tell me by titles which of them are dupes *for example* posted before and delete or something along those lines, in order to prevent such situations again.
P.S: you can always mail us at support@ninjadollars.com and we will ALWAYS take care of any/every complaint issue you guys have.
I have the latest game as being downloaded on the 31st May 2013 so it was definitely on the site then.
The other episodes from about that time that haven't yet been repeated but have disappeared is no 299
It seems the repeated ones are have been 293,294,295,298,300 they were all released about april/may and subsequently removed.
I think some may have been bonus updates due to the three different episodes of episode 264 being posted about this time hope this helps.
I think it may also be episodes 308 and 309 replaced two of the repeated episodes in may when the above were removed.
The datestamp on my copy of Team Champion with Team Fuck Yeah vs team vagenda is 31st May 2013, that's when I downloaded it from you, it will have been posted possibly a few days before that.
Ok, i understand, i will keep this video for the sake of those who do not have it and release a new one today also as update! and we will implement the upcoming videos thing asap so you guys can review all before the videos will go live!
Google has a cache of the old upload dated 7 Oct 2013 16:29:07 GMT. Hopefully the bonus clip is a good one.
Hey red, been a fan since you started way back... I e asked for a while now to see no light shown down towards any new pov match games and Pov interactive games. It seems like a waste the way your site started out to not follow thru with those. Would love to hear a status update about it.
Unlike the Dakotas in America that have mountains, the Dakotas that are on LostBets don't even have molehills.... Their breasts in the free preview (while I appreciate the notion of a quick freebie) remind me of the 4 mosquito bites last time I went boating. Too each his own, and I've seen email duels before over the issue, but I want to cast my ballot for non-fake BOOBS.
Any chance that lostbetsgames.com can become ipad compatible? I guess increasing numbers who don't want to own content would like to stream it on portable devices.
All LostBetsGames videos/trailers & .mp4 downloads has been reconverted to stream on mobile devices (iOS) that does not support flash streaming about 2 weeks ago.
Hey Red, not a huge deal, but in the episode 367 you give away who one of the winners will be when you say "They get to use her however they want".
I can't wait for 369, that the one with Maddie and the two Dakotas, right? Are you going to release any previews for it soon?
Okay, I'm glad that things are going smoothly with the membership site now. Thanks, @Updater, for taking care of this.
@Video editing guy: Yes, I got your email, but I haven't had time to respond yet. I've had an awful lot on my plate. I'll get to it.
@DaM: Progress is being made on the POVs/interactives, but I don't have any more detail to report. Still hoping to have the POV store open by the end of the year.
@Mychestisbiggerthantheirs: Hey, I drove through South Dakota once, and the place was flat as a pancake. But don't fear: even if both Dakotas are a little small-chested to your tastes, I'm sure there are other new girls who'll be more to your liking. Wait 'til you meet Heather and Lela, for example.
@TWSS: Whoops. I tried to avoid gender-specific pronouns and failed. (Morgan just told me to blame her, as my proofreader.) Sorry about that. I figure probably most people would want to know the gender of the loser anyway.
@Mychestisbiggerthantheirs: Heather and Lela will debut in Episode 375. Heather's limits are very tight, so games with her as a player will be fairly softcore. Lela is a lot more adventurous, and risked more when facing opponents with similar limits.
369 was awesome! I was praying for more interaction between the cute Brooklyn and the curvy rubenesque Selah. I would love to see the little Brooklyn as a lesbian sub to the experienced nuturing Selah!
Dakota Skye WAS awesome in 369. The physical contrast between tiny Dakota and voluptuous Selah was exciting. Love to see these two together again with lez action.
Here are a few morsels of delight for you to indulge in this Sunday. . . where two of my favourite worlds meet- sweets and vibrators of course!
The vibrators in Image 1 – Midori Vibrator by Tenga Iroha , Image 3 – Yuki Vibrator by Tenga Iroha and Image 4 – Sakura Vibrator by Tenga Iroha are all now available at Max Black.
Herb Berkowitz began working for Hinky Dinky at age 17 and remained a Hinky Dinky employee until his retirement, interrupted only by WWII when he served in the Army. After managing stores and serving as a supervisor for many years, Herb became a grocery buyer. Ultimately, he began assisting Jule Newman in buying and merchandising staple groceries.
In 1935, Hinky Dinky, for the first time, had a store which was losing money. It was located in downtown Council Bluffs on W. Broadway, the main street. Herb was a combination store auditor and supervisor, while attending Creighton University at night. Jule decided to reassign Herb to take over supervision, giving him full authority to do or change anything he wanted, including staff, merchandising, pricing, and, advertising. In three months time the W. Broadway Hinky Dinky became the leading store in the chain, in both volume and profits.

Personality: Raivynne isn't as confident as she wishes she were, but she is book smart. Her temper is very, well, fiery... you do not want to get her angry. She is a brilliant swords woman and can handle a scythe sort of, don't stand around her when she is swinging it. Raivynne carries her fire in a lantern around her waist on a belt. Whatever you do DO NOT TOUCH the lantern or she'll personally send you to Hades.
History: It is unknown when Raivynne was born but when she first looked up she saw the moon, and ever since then moon has been her symbol for everything. Hecate found Raivynne holding her fire in her hands under the full moon on her (Hecate) way to the Underworld; she spoke to her and brought with her to Hades demanding that Raivynne be made one of her lampades. Ever since Raivynne has been personally serving Hecate. Hecate had asked for volunteers of her age to volunteer, and so Raivynne did.

I picked my girl from school yesterday (29th) and we were walking towards the car when all of a sudden she looked at me about to tear and started screaming " I got toys in my pocket!" Turned out she put some cubix into her little shorts pocket.
I turned back to the main entrance and she was running and saying " I got toys, I got toys." Mrs Wong who was still at the door was surprised to see us back. Athena quickly took off her shoes and made a dash to her Ms Leaw. I don't know what was the conversation about between them but Ms Leaw and Mrs Wong were smiling. I too was smiling but also feel proud that my daughter knows that she is not suppose to take things that don't belong to her. Well, she was out I praised her and told her she didn't do it on purpose.
Life is so unfair. I know people are born and will die but I can't accept the truth that one of my ex-colleague had left this world.
It was just the usual yearly Christmas E-card I send to her and yesterday her husband emailed me and told me the news that she had left to be with the Lord on 14th June 05. June?? 6 months ago??
I couldn't help it but just burst down crying. She was a great lady in her 40s, she was my shifu in the bank I used to work. First impression I had was "cham lah... she's so fierce." But it turned out looks is deceiving. And after I left the bank to join the airline; got married and gave birth 2 years later, she was there always for my new chapter in life. She was there for chats and definitely not gossips but she gave alot of motherly and worldly advise. It's a real pity that I wasn't in touch with her for 9 months or so. My heart goes to her loved ones, especially Alvin and his sister who simply adores their mom .
* We should treasure everyone around us. Perhaps you should give your friends and loved ones a hug today and tell them how much you care *
Finally get to finish this Part 2 video montage which is completed 1 year after I finish my first one. This was done progressively over a couple of days but decided that I have to complete this today.
I know my sister is going to kill me because I'm suppose to be concentrating on my business. But hey! It runs in the blood... I've got acute ADHD. Can't blame me for taking a break once in awhile right??
Brought girl to Orchard in the morning, at about 12pm hubby came from work and joined us. We spent the next half day having our lunch and sitting through King Kong. The show lasted 3 hours... bad choice especially if you have a kid around.
Girl was so funny, when the ship hit against the rocks, she said "Oh.. the bost spoil already. I dowan sit boat boat next time." Then she seems scared when the dinosaurs came out and would climb and sit with me. At some point I'll cover her eyes for her and narrate the story for her. As usual, when she's paying attention to the show she'll know what's going on. She even made the remark "Ting Kong sad sad.." And also said "why Ting Kong hit her ne-ne?" When King Kong was beating its chest. And then when it finally died at the Empire State Building, I told her "King Kong or or already.." When it fell down she started screaming.... "Oh Ting Kong fall down."
This makes me recall sometime early this year too she made this first remark at my sister (her ah yi). Ah yi asked her to take sanitary napkin and kapo girl went to the side table; took out the napkin and went " Nah! Ah yi your Pampers!!"
Quite hilarious too when we were at the supermarket and she sees me grabbing a pack.. she'll make a loud remark "Mummy, you buying Pampers?"
My so sweet brother gave me an electronic Sudoku gameset with 100,000 over games inside (that's what they claim). Well... my brain will shrink even smaller and brain cells die faster. I'm looking forward to playing it.. but I still haven't finished the book yet!
Am suppose to start my business next month but looks like there are a lot of things to be done... so preparing myself early is good.
But it also means that I'll be fully exhausted as I have to make sure girl's room is done up before CNY, call HDB to mend the cracks on the ceiling, dub the tapes, spring cleaning. Sigh..............two hands so many tasks.
Had some time on my own as daughter fell asleep early at 8 plus, so decided to do some manicure and pedicure. I felt my hands and feet "much cleaner". Haha! I haven't done it for such a long time.. so it's a rare treat for me.
The way MacD and KFC tries to entice children to eat is to introduce Happy Meal and Chicken Meal. Of course there's always a toy inside there.
Needless to say sometimes parents are tempted to buy toys and 'get to eat' for their children. Admittedly I fall into this category. Sometimes I do go for the children's meal as they're small portion. It helps with my pocket and also with the waistline.
But it also means that I always end up with a lot of toys. I bring them home and let my girl play with it and then I start throwing them away after some time coz' I hate too many things at home. So it's a horrible cycle. But I still keep some of em' like the cute Hello Kitty bag and hairband which seems to be big on her head.
My girl turned to me and told me "mummy I very happy today, I take choo-choo chort chort (train), I no angry I happy today."
On our walk home from the station, she told me "I like to take bus, I very happy sit on the bus." I promised her one day I'll take her on the bus (when I'm not in a hurry) .
I was waiting with my girl outside the Crystal Jade at Takashimaya for lunch. Two well-dressed ladies were talking to my girl, and then turned and asked "only one child and you're expecting another one??"
Umm.... maybe that gives me an idea. I should pretend to be pregnant and wear loose clothings whenever I decide to take the train. But then again, how many times people do give up their seats??
My girl was telling uncle that Braxton is her boyfriend and she also told grandma that she has alot of boyfriend in the school.
Braxton is about 2 months older than my girl. In school my girl was close to another boy Jiajun and I don't know when she dumped him and was close to Braxton after that.
Signs of horror!! I was flipping through last year's photos and I saw something. And this year he gave her a tight hug....
SUddenly she tells me she's a big girl when I can't tie her towel. She pointed to our big towel and said "mummy, you buy a big big towel like this for me, ok" I big girl already."
On Friday dua-gu was conversing with her and he spouted some Singlish himself and I told him off. My girl kindda acted on my side; pointed her finger at uncle and say "hor..hor." And gave her funny look.
Then he wanted to make her say the words again. He pretended to accuse her of saying "lah" when she became so defensive " I never say lah-lah-lah-lah." So funny.............
Hubby and myself were like little kids this morning, we got out of bed and were talking about how our precious little girl will surprise us with her performance. And my hubby had to ask me upteen times, do you know what is she going to dance? I asked her for an exclusive sneak preview but she didn't give in. Even when I tried bribing her with foods; she ate them and refused to dance. Argh! Goon goon mother!!
Upon arriving at the church, photos of the full dress rehearsal were displayed outside and inside the foyer. It costs $2 for 5R photos (make good $) and this year she has more photos so I ended up cutting down on all the quantity to 1 each. Still.. I paid close to $30 .
The Year end Concert cum Graduation 2005 started at 6 minutes late, 10.06am. And I began to realise the "my friend, my friend" my girl has been telling me about is one of the graduands and I haven't gotten the slightest idea of his name. But if I'm going through the concert pamphlet correctly, he should be Ebenezer Koh.
The concert started about half an hour later and my girl's performance is the 5th one. 3rd performance was done by N1 Hope, which is the playgroup (aged 18 months to 2 yrs). I remember there were alot of kids in that class so what happened to the rest of them?? Click on the icons below to view the videos.
The "too excited me" was like switching between camera and video camera on the video cam I was holding. That the front portion of her performance was recorded wrongly on the card. Thank goodness for the second part I switched back. She looked so mature and kawaii. Yup! Jiajun was not there... and a few others. Hubby felt that there's nothing much to her dance this year, "only standing there and action action." I felt the same way too.
During the second half (Her Dance Part 2) of her dance she suddenly noticed my brother and me were standing there, she was quite distracted after that as she kept looking towards her left.
The rests of the performance was so-so. The performance by K2 we thought was quite usual until the children start picking up their hula hoops and dance. Much to the cheering crowd and everyone's leaning forward to watch it, the performance made everyone ALIVE after that.
Two other performances after that and it was the finale. Again, she was looking at us. Then she started looking for people she know. She finally saw grandma and was mouthing " ma-ma, my ma-ma." See if you can catch her mouthing that.
Notes : I think she did a good job and no doubt she was enjoying herself. All these... and she had no appetite for breakfast this morning; was coughing quite badly. As we all expected it she was very tired in the car and when we got home after lunch she fell asleep for a good whole 5 hours.
Funny thing that happened : Dua-gu was pointing out to all the children in the photos and she was naming them. Then when he pointed out to Braxton, she asked "Braxton is your.. what?" My cute girl answered "my boyfriend." We had a good laugh.
As we walked down the steps we caught sight of Melia and Braxton playing so I wanted to snap shots of them. I love it coz' they were all hugging so tightly and the adults were afraid that they might fall. Kids are kids.
1) She always has that smiley face when she's dancing. She's one kid that needs encouragement and nudging, it's a real wonder that she has no signs of stage fright and still smiles so nicely.
2) No doubt the glittery thing is nice but we can't see it on stage. And what I hate about glitters is the difficulty in removing them. Washed her hair for a long time and still can see something shiny.
Been trying out to convert the amr file to wav but downloading into any online sharing is unsuccessful. So I guess the only way is to do it the old way via youtube by recording it down.
She has been doing well and going without diapers in the night, except for two occasions where she pee-ed on the bed.
I think apart from her horrible temper and tau-hong-ness, my girl has been easy to bring up. It took us little training only 2-3 days to wean her off from diapers and she was okay. She knew what we were doing and the instructions given to her. Once (in the beginning stage) she actually tried to run to the toilet but pee-ed along the way. Well, she was crying.. I had to console her and praise her for doing a good job by running to the toilet.
When she was a baby, she was a smiley and happy baby. And a little pig too! She sleeps through the night at 2 months. She never cries in the night except for the first month, which for goodness sake we were first time parents also dunno she cry for what. We tried all means until my mom popped in the pacifier. Arks! Anyway that took us less than a week to wean her off from pacifier.
My girl made me roll on the floor last night when I asked her to stand straight. All of a sudden she started singing our National Anthem, and you guessed it right. At some point she had her lips pouted like " chui tu tu" and then she kept repeating the same thing. I guess she has the same problem as I do. Then I asked her to recite the pledge in English, she was mumbling. The funniest part was struggling to hear her speak in Chinese. Sometimes she sounds like an ang-moh sometimes she sounds okay. Yesterday she sounded okay but I thought at some point she was repeating herself. I don't know coz' I don't know the pledge myself.
I'm not boasting just because she's my girl, but my girl is really smart. She answers you back with good solid sentences that will just shut you up; she has good memory when she sees something on TV, she'll help me phrase out a sentence which I've taught her in her nightly lessons.
She don't behave like my other cousin's children who's about the same age as her. My uncles and aunties all praise her for her independence (okay... sometimes she'll whine and 'yang or') and 'streetsmart'.
So what attributes to her smart-ness? Most importantly it's the genes from the mother plus during pregnancy she took some more from me. No wonder now the mother so stupid.
Enfagrow A+ have this attached to their small can of milk -900g. And since girl is on this Enfa A+ range since birth, decided to buy it. Forgot that we still had 2 large cans -each 1800g in our cupboard.
The board game is mainly for young kids but I like the stampers. Feel like buying another 3 cans to make up sets of four and I get 8 stampers.
Chey! Dunno who's the kid now?? But hey! It's not easy to find Sesame Street stampers leh... was trying so hard online.
My girl surprised me when I asked her how to spell her name. She went " A-T-H-E-N-A"- ningun problema. Muy bueno, muy listo (spanish for very good, very clever)
I had another dream of me back flying again. I've lost count to how many dreams I had but some of them were quite funny. Last night I dreamt that was I was helping out in Economy Class and somehow I've missed alot of rows and received complaints. Funny thing is.. when I connected the dream this morning, I was a LSS helping out (not a main crew there). So how did I miss out rows???? And why in the first place I was manning a cart??
I guess I really miss flying. Everytime I sit on the plane or go to the airport I'll think back of what I'll be doing right now if I was not preggie with my girl. Then I'll be green with envy when I see them packing up to fly to places which now I can only go whenever I join my hubby on his business trips or when we go on our annual holidays. sigh.............
I missed the chance when I passed the interview to go back as a flying mother. I gave it up all because my hubby told me " I'm going to fly alot next year. I dowan the girl to be parent-less."
Now I hope for a chance to let me rekindle my old job - even if it's for a month. And yes my dear readers.. I do enjoy the job alot!!
Was watching the Travel & Living Channel last night and they were introducing Northern France. I was so excited when they shot a distanced view of Mont St Michel. And yes, when I was there years ago the guide was telling us that we were very lucky that our bus could drive on the bridge to the abbey, otherwise we might have to walk on the "sands". Well, I guess even if I did go and maybe died in the process of getting there it's worth it. Coz' I've been dying to go there and once I flew in to Paris.. I just took the opportunity to go there. *Let me try to scan the photo I took (if I did take from the distance). Anyway the guide had to walk in the sand and she was stuck. Haha!
My girlfriend was coaching me on how to play Sudoku when I chanced upon it on the Today's papers. And I must it's finally making my brain work.. otherwise I'm really BRAIN DEAD!!
It's quite fun and I am proud to say that I managed to solve my very first one with no hiccups. ( Very smart hor??) And been able to do so for the rests of the puzzles.
Having lived in Singapore for 30 years (okay say 20 years, minus the infant years) I'm sorry to say but I'm really suaku and didn't know that such neighbourhood exists. Yesterday we wanted to bring my girl go gai-gai. So as usual I can only suggests Orchard or Suntec area, then hubby said "let's go Sembawang."
All I can say is just by that trip... I realised that I'm quite suaku... what Chong Pang place?? Never heard of it before.
I was very happy with my buy $9.90 for a 5L Dynamo a few days ago. Then hubby helped me carry up from the car last evening and I was talking about how cheap it is. At NTUC later, I kept telling him "neh.. you see it's $7+ for a 3L..." " Yah lah, yah lah. You very smart lah," he said.
When I got home I kept thinking of what I said earlier on... and I feel that I'm beginning to sound like an auntie. Argh!!! Now I must start talking about high teas; manicures; pedicures and fashion.
So happy.. my girl didn't wet her bed. But still not taking any chances, will continue putting the protector sheet on until she's 6 or 7.
For two nights I tried my girl going without diapers in the night. Actually it prompted me to start early when my girl complaint that her diapers is tight (the ones at my mom's place are L size). So I told her that she will go diaper-less and will have to wake me up in the night when she wants to go toilet. But of course before that I asked mom for something plastic to put between her mattress sheet and mattress.
I am proud to say that for the two nights she did not wake me up at all, she managed to control her bladder all through. Which can be good and can also be bad. Good is - I can have my uninterrupted sleep, bad is controlling her bladder at such young age is no good.
I shall try again tonight. But I have a feeling that she might leak tonight. Why? Coz' she'll be back sleeping in the air-conditioned room.
In the wee hours today at about 4plus, mom and myself were woken up by this rackus opposite our block.(at Tampines) At first it was a guy shouting vulgarities, car door slamming etc..There were a couple of guys a girl and then we heard someone got slapped and a woman wailed. (she sounded drunk to me) and then there were some commotion. And somehow we dunno from where some other turned up and probably "watched". Dunno lah, I could have reported the wrong number of people at present site but can't blame me if we were all still so blur after being roused from our sleep and our view were partially blocked by a tree. Cars came and go, nobody offered to help. The altruistic me decided to call 999 to report the incident, and hey! Where are the police?? For good whole 15 minutes after I called the incident continued. Someone came by in a motorcycle, and at first we thought it was the police (but police in motorcycle??) but it was a guy who told them. Well, I can't make out what he told them but all I know is he was snapped back with a loud "you shut up." And probably close to 4.50 or 4.50+, I saw the victim being carried to the block, probably up to her flat or maybe kena raped at the stairs??? I can't see what happened but for sure there were no more shouting or slapping or wailing. At 5.05am I heard cars coming and pick up some people and left, infact we did notice 3 other guys squatting at the carpark smoking. But eventually everyone left at 5.05am.
So during the whold episode where were the police?? If someone was beaten (as what I had reported), the assaultants would have finished the job in less than 15 minutes and run away. Who would be so stupid to stay behind and get caught??
Mom also did say "well, during the recent fire at Blk 261 the firefighters came first and after a long long time, the police then came." And you know what my dear friends?? The NPP is only 1 block away!!!
My girl so cute this morning. She remembered about her cookie"; brought it to me and asked "mummy, you take picture already? Can I eat?"
Then when you asked her when is dua-gu coming back, she'll keep telling you 2 weeks. That is because she remembers the video dua-gu sent over weeks ago.
Girl gt up the moment we carried her out of the car. Back home in Tampines where she sleeps on the floor (and where I'll too when I sleep over at mom's place) she covered herself nicely with this silk comforter which my mom bought from China. Mom said she jiam it and said she wants it. (So selfish)
Wah............this chocolate fountain smacked infront of Heeren is really tempting. If you're wondering I was lured into this. No! I just kept thinking about my weight and flab around my body.
Ungrateful girl! Everytime I go out I'll buy some munchies for her and when she saw me earlier she told me "I dowan mummy." I saw this cute cookie from SwissBake at Taka and decided to buy it for her. Then at Centrepoint saw this pack of caramel almonds and remembered how she'd snatch it away from me all the time. Must quickly snap this before she bites off the cookie.
Did some shopping today, first stop was Aussino as there was a 50% discount on bedding for Kids. Ended up buying 3 pc towels to match Athena's bedsheet. I went to Happy House and was looking around for girlie ornaments to put in her room. However I quickly stopped myself as I remembered what the heck I was shopping for girlie things when she wanted a Pooh theme. I should instead look for things that will make her room looks like a 100 acres wood. I think I will go down again tomorrow after my gym to see if there's anything else to buy, afterall it won't kill to have 3 sets of beddings items right?
Did some other buys and I think the real impulse buy was a dress from Marton-Bell. I like party dresses (that's the good thing about having a girl). Very sweet so I hope to get invited to someone's Xmas party.............

A trend first noted in February of 2010, ever more manufacturing companies are deciding to insource or self perform manufacturing work. By ending tax breaks to companies that outsource and increasing manufacturing tax deductions, the stage has been set for a revitalized manufacturing sector according to a recent article by the US Treasury Dept.
Apart from creating great middle class jobs, manufacturing accounts for 9% of employment, 12% of GDP, 60% of exports, and 69% of private sector R&D spending. Furthermore, the innovations from such R&D transcend beyond the company and have a multiplier effect within the local communities where the manufacturer is located. As we noted in a recent series of articles on the economic advantages of relocating from California to Nevada, firms are likely to enjoy a much higher degree of profitability with a Nevada address.

1 One sabbath while Jesus was going through the grainfields, his disciples plucked some heads of grain, rubbed them in their hands, and ate them. 2 But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?” 3 Jesus answered, “Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry? 4 He entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and gave some to his companions?” 5 Then he said to them, “The Son of Man is lord of the sabbath.”
6 On another sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught, and there was a man there whose right hand was withered. 7 The scribes and the Pharisees watched him to see whether he would cure on the sabbath, so that they might find an accusation against him. 8 Even though he knew what they were thinking, he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come and stand here.” He got up and stood there. 9 Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the sabbath, to save life or to destroy it?” 10 After looking around at all of them, he said to him, “Stretch out your hand.” He did so, and his hand was restored. 11 But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.
13 When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself, 14 saying,
“I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.” 15 And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised. 16 People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument.
17 Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath. 18 God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie,
19 We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, 20 where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.
Hebrews 13:1-2 1 Let mutual love continue. 2 Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing that some have entertained angels without knowing it
35 Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. “Teacher,” they said, “we want you to do for us whatever we ask.”
38 “You don’t know what you are asking,” Jesus said. “Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?”
Jesus said to them, “You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with, 40 but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared.”
41 When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. 42 Jesus called them together and said, “You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them. 43 Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, 44 and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all. 45 For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”
2 On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. 2 Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. 3 When the wine gave out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.” 4 And Jesus said to her, “Woman, what concern is that to you and to me? My hour has not yet come.” 5 His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.” 6 Now standing there were six stone water jars for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. 7 Jesus said to them, “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled them up to the brim. 8 He said to them, “Now draw some out, and take it to the chief steward.” So they took it. 9 When the steward tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the steward called the bridegroom 10 and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk. But you have kept the good wine until now.” 11 Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.
9 As he walked along, he saw a man blind from birth. 2 His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” 3 Jesus answered, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God’s works might be revealed in him. 4 We must work the works of him who sent me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work. 5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” 6 When he had said this, he spat on the ground and made mud with the saliva and spread the mud on the man’s eyes, 7 saying to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means Sent). Then he went and washed and came back able to see.

5 In the days of King Herod of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly order of Abijah. His wife was a descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. 6 Both of them were righteous before God, living blamelessly according to all the commandments and regulations of the Lord. 7 But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were getting on in years.
8 Once when he was serving as priest before God and his section was on duty, 9 he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the sanctuary of the Lord and offer incense. 10 Now at the time of the incense offering, the whole assembly of the people was praying outside. 11 Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing at the right side of the altar of incense. 12 When Zechariah saw him, he was terrified; and fear overwhelmed him. 13 But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will name him John. 14 You will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, 15 for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He must never drink wine or strong drink; even before his birth he will be filled with the Holy Spirit. 16 He will turn many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. 17 With the spirit and power of Elijah he will go before him, to turn the hearts of parents to their children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.” 18 Zechariah said to the angel, “How will I know that this is so? For I am an old man, and my wife is getting on in years.” 19 The angel replied, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. 20 But now, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time, you will become mute, unable to speak, until the day these things occur.”
21 Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah, and wondered at his delay in the sanctuary. 22 When he did come out, he could not speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He kept motioning to them and remained unable to speak. 23 When his time of service was ended, he went to his home.
24 After those days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she remained in seclusion. She said, 25 “This is what the Lord has done for me when he looked favorably on me and took away the disgrace I have endured among my people.”
57 Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son. 58 Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.
59 On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him Zechariah after his father. 60 But his mother said, “No; he is to be called John.” 61 They said to her, “None of your relatives has this name.” 62 Then they began motioning to his father to find out what name he wanted to give him. 63 He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And all of them were amazed. 64 Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue freed, and he began to speak, praising God. 65 Fear came over all their neighbors, and all these things were talked about throughout the entire hill country of Judea. 66 All who heard them pondered them and said, “What then will this child become?” For, indeed, the hand of the Lord was with him.
80 The child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day he appeared publicly to Israel.
27 When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. 28 Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
29 Once when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted. 30 And Esau said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am exhausted!” (Therefore his name was called Edom.) 31 Jacob said, “Sell me your birthright now.” 32 Esau said, “I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?” 33 Jacob said, “Swear to me now.” So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob. 34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
“For my own name’s sake I delay my wrath; for the sake of my praise I hold it back from you, so as not to cut you off. See, I have refined you, though not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction. For my own sake, for my own sake, I do this. How can I let myself be defamed? I will not yield my glory to another.”

O ye who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islam. (Surah Al-Imran-102)
This is an English translation of Ibn Rajab al Hanbali's classic work Jami'al Ulum Wal Hikam. It is basically a listing of 50 ahadith (sayings of the Prophet), and along with them are comments, lessons to be learned from them, and sayings of the Sahaba regarding them.
avant-garde painting, we lind ourselves inc1ined to stress the formative function of our art at the expense of the forms of the characters. This new art, known as Bokusho, which is derived from the art of Shoo is not based on characters but is a much more abstract form of self expression. I believe that the art of all people is ultimately a genuine expression of human Ii Ie and not an art of portraying objects The art of Shoo which has at its very basis the desire to express the spirit of man is, therelore, an art which has an appeal to both the Oriental and the Occidental world. Its study can bring rewards to all men who care to spend the time to dream upon its meaning._ ON JAPANESE BRUSHES Japanese brushes were once the universal implement for writing in the daily life of the Japanese but the introduction of pens and fountain pens from the West began to limit their daily use except in the art of Shoo Japanese brushes are made from rabbit fur, wool, horsehair SHOTEr IBATA HARMONY (1971) Japanese sumion IIcepape. 218mx366m and raccoon -dog hair by craftsmen of delicate skill who use the traditional methods of the past in making them. They differ from brushes made and used in Europe and America. One essential characteristic is that they must retain the sumi ink and be able to draw several kinds of delicate line. They are classified into two kinds, hard fur brushes and soft fur brushes. The former are made from the hair of deer, horses, and raccoon-dogs and are used for the making of strong lines. The soft fur brushes. chiefly made of wool, are ideal for the execution of soft, elastic or tender and delicate lines. ON JAPANESE PAPERS Japanese papers are made from mitumata (edgewofthia chrysantha), Kozo (mulberry paper) or gampi (wikstroemia rice papers). They can be used for the making of artistic blottings and blurrings, the variety 01 such being made at the speed of writing ; but when using Japanese papers for artistic blotting and blurring allowance must be made for the correct amount and consistency of the sum; ink. They provide for a range of effects which cannot be represented on Western papers. of Sho is crealed on a piece 01 paper, (he limited space 01 the paper is transfo:med into an infinite space wherein the rhythm ollile moves. Where strokes of the brush cross or overlap each other an effect of depth is produced, as distinct from an out - lined plain f igure which, when drawn, produces only the effect of flatness. Thus a whole work of Sho possesses an exquisite three -dimensional quality. The art 01 Sho is executed in black ink on white Japanese paper. The simple black ink is no less abstract than the form and is thus quite suited to the artist's intention - to express the purity 01 the rhythm of life. The beauty of harmony between lines of black ink is always pursued in the context of the white (that is the infinite space) and because of this the art of Sho may be called an art of black and white rather than an art of black ink. This graceful art of black and white possesses a sentiment that may be thought of as a mystic manifestation of the human spirit . In recent times, particularly because of the influence of 236 ON JAPANESE INKS Sumi is used when creating the art of Shoo There are two kinds of sumi - shoenboku and yuenboku. Shoenboku is made hom pine-tree twig, burned in a charcoal oven that is fitted with a small paper chimney cap. The soot is gathered from the small chimney and is then kneaded with liquid glue into a suitable mixture. Yuenboku is sesame oil or rape seed oil (colza oil). The oil is poured into an earthen vessel and lit. The vessel is covered with a screen to which the soot adheres and from which it is collected to prepare the sumi. Recently, sum; has been made from mineral oil, too. Sum; is made in China and Japan but Chinese sumi contains much more glue than does the Japanese. The color of sum; is not always the same although it is basically black. There are degrees of intensity of black hom light grey to deep black and tinges of other colours like blue or light brown may be discerned in some blacks. The artist chooses the shade of sum; which best suits his needs for any particular work. ART and Australia December 1971

An intravascular MRI (IMRI) loopless antenna is combined for the first time with an intravascular water-cooled ultrasound ablation transducer as a possible tool for providing high-resolution MRI-guided ablations of pathological tissue via intravascular access. High resolution anatomical MRI, and real-time MRI thermometry were used to monitor ablation delivery in phantoms and tissue specimens. Results show that IMRI can guide IVUS-mediated directional ablation with minimal image artifacts. This permits the monitoring of thermal dose and therapy titration while minimizing potential thermal damage to the vessel wall.

Electrical conductivity is a passive material property primarily determined by concentrations of charge carriers and their mobility. The macroscopic conductivity of biological tissue at low frequency may exhibit anisotropy related with its structural directionality. When expressed as a tensor and properly quantified, the conductivity tensor can provide diagnostic information of numerous diseases. Imaging of conductivity distributions inside the human body requires probing it by externally injecting conduction currents or inducing eddy currents. Here we propose a novel method to reconstruct conductivity tensor images using an MRI scanner without any current injection.
I recently took the train to Chicago, where I found myself enjoying a glass of 2011 Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru with Erwan Faiveley.
Faiveley is the seventh generation to head-up Domaine Faiveley, one of Burgundy's most illustrious producers. He took over in 2007 when he was 25 years old.
Faiveley was in attendance at a Burgundian wine tasting hosted by New York-based importer Frederick Wildman & Sons.
I grabbed Faiveley and a glass of his wine, hoping that he could help to demystify the notoriously confusing wines of his home turf. And he used the historic emperor to get our lesson going.
According to Faiveley, even "under Charlemagne's reign, the market noticed" that the wines from Burgundy were something special.
Charlemagne, who reigned as king or emperor from A.D. 768 to 814, is said to have been the first to have a particular hillside - now called Corton-Charlemagne - planted with white grape varieties.
So when it's on the label, it tells you that the grapes are from Corton-Charlemagne, which is a grand cru vineyard in which Chardonnay is the only permitted grape.
Grand cru is the top classification for vineyards in Burgundy, and accounts for about 2% of total production.
The story also goes - or so I've read - that Charlemagne's wife preferred white wine because it didn't stain her husband's white beard.
So my head was swimming from the $250-a-bottle wine, not from the effort of trying to understand how to read a Burgundy label.
He soldiered on: "You know exactly what you've got in every bottle because it is so tightly controlled by the law."
If the label says Nuits-Saint-Georges "Les Porets Saint-George" 1er Cru, "you know what small plot the grapes are from - and we don't even have to write Pinot Noir on the label," he said.
Faiveley explained that "for centuries, when oil did not exist, all the work had to be done by hand and with horses. So the plots had to be small enough to work by hand."
It is also a region based on "terroir," or the mix of soil, climate and other less quantifiable factors that give each vineyard or plot its unique characteristics.
Over the centuries it has been determined that Pinot Noir or Chardonnay from one place in Burgundy will taste subtly different from that of another vineyard.
Faiveley conceded that it's best to do some reading about Burgundy so you can start to grasp an area that has something like 1,200 of these different-tasting plots, which are also know as "climats."
"Also, I would highly suggest you go to wine tastings and see what style and what producer you like," he said.
The delicate 2011 Mercurey "Clos Rochette" from Faiveley, a Chardonnay, costs about $30, and in my estimation is a standout for the price.
Phil Bilodeau of Thief Wine Shop in Milwaukee and Shorewood was at the Chicago event, and - not talking specifically about Faiveley - he said that you can get simple white Burgundy such as Macon-Villages for $20 or less.

I am lying in the darkness in my hospital room about 2 a.m. and all the nursing stations are quiet at that time and it’s just me and my breathing and my fear about losing the function of my right leg to the cancer that has spread to my lower spine. And Robin. She is sleeping in a foldout chair the hospital provided for her, as well as she can. She is staying that first night in the hospital with me. As I lie there, in the darkness, staring at the ceiling, the thought comes to me that my pain has taken me from my life and brought me to a place where people come at the end of their lives, to die. The pain has brought me out of my life and carried me to my death. And I lie there with that thought for awhile and then the … Continue

Allah has sent the Messenger (S) with guidance and the Religion of Truth. Strict adherence to the guidance of His Prophet (S) is required from the followers of Islam. The scholars of the Islamic community have attached great importance to it and produced texts regarding the Acts of Worship, Dealings and Habits in the light of the Divine guidance. This book is one of the most famous works written on this subject. This book is one of the important resources of knowledge for those who seek to know the Seerah of their Prophet (PBUH) as well as, the Fiqh learned from it. This is a book that is unique in that it explains the Sunnah through the Seerah and the Seerah through the Sunnah.
The final phase of the Bush Theatre's gradual transformation from a former public library building is complete, with the theatre officially opening in Spring 2017.
This phase of work provided a new accessible entrance to the main street. The design establishes a distinct identity for the theatre and connects the street more directly to the reconfigured interior spaces.
The improvements ensure full disability access to all floors, the creation of a workshop for scenery construction and the introduction of two dressing rooms, along with flexible studio and rehearsal spaces.
The Bush Theatre was highly commended for "outstanding achievement" in the Cultural Building of the Year category at this year's AJ Retrofit Awards, and has also been selected by the Hammersmith Society as winner of their Conservation Award for 2017.
The first few days of breastfeeding is hard. I will be the first to admit it. In fact in the hospital I spent a lot of time in tears because Shelby was having latching problems, I couldn’t get comfortable and I was exhausted still from the whole week before hand.
Once we got home on the Monday following her birth things were a little easier. I was able to relax which also helped Shelby to relax. I was able to use our nursing pillow and be comfortable. Sure nursing takes up a good portion of your day but I love it. It makes me sit down, relax and enjoy some quiet time with the baby,
Below are some of my absolute favorite must have products for nursing. Of course every mom and baby is different, so while these products work for us, they may not work for everyone!
The first thing I absolutely love is our Boppy. We have a bare naked boppy and various covers for it. For newborns I love using the Newborn Booster. Below is Shelby laying in my lap with both the boppy and the newborn booster on top. I love that the Booster gives a slight incline for her, and it’s comfortable for me to have her laying in my lap.
When it came to nursing tops I thought any kind would work. But for me, the ones by boob Designs is my favorite. Quite pricey, but so worth it. I have three different short sleeve tops and two tank tops from boob designs. What I love about them is that there is a flap that sits right below the breast that you pull up to nurse. You don’t show any kind of skin what so ever!
A good nursing bra. I love my Bravado Bliss Nursing Bra and my Sport Wire free Nursing Bra by Leading Lady. Having a good nursing bra is probably one of the most important products. I got them both a size larger than I wore pre-pregnancy and they fit great. Gave just enough room for when my breasts are full. I love wearing the sport wire free to bed.
While out and public I always use my Nursing Cover from Bebe au Lait. I have no problem nursing in public, but I also like to stay covered as to not annoy other people. A nursing cover is much better than throwing a blanket over you and baby. with a nursing cover they are specially designed with a patented RigiFlex™ neckline that allows you to look down and see the baby.
A breast pump. Yes, we are exclusively breastfeeding but I also like to pump so I can start a freezer stash. These pumping’s can be used during long road trips and for any emergency situations. We have the Medela Pump In Style Advanced. This pump is great for moms who have gone back to work or are pumping a lot to bottle feed. I don’t think it’s a must have for moms who are exclusively breastfeeding but if you want to invest into a great pump then, Medela is the way to go. We are storing the breast milk in the Lansinoh Breast Milk Storage Bags. We haven’t actually used a bottle yet so I have no idea which would work the best for us.
Nursing pads. While I don’t use them every day I love having them on hand and in the diaper bag. If I go out in public and will be out for more than an hour I will use them. My absolute favorite are my Nuk Washable Nursing Pads. I love that they are washable and I can reuse them. They are also much cheaper than disposable nursing pads. I have about ten pairs of reusable nursing pads and I think it is a perfect amount.
another item we use a lot is burp cloths. I really didn’t think we would need them since we are breastfeeding, but Shelby definitely needs to be burped after each feeding and sometimes spits up when she over eats. I made my own burp cloths that I love! They didn’t cost a whole lot to make either. for half a yard I could make three burp cloths. I used Michael Miller fabric so for half a yard it was 4 dollars. The chenille was 12 dollars for a yard, and I was able to cut nine chenille pieces for burp cloths.
And a book that I love, and also reading for my Doula Training is The Nursing Mother’s Companion. I also like Breastfeeding Made Simple: Seven Natural Laws for Nursing Mothers.
Shelby is only a month old so I am sure there are tons of other must have nursing products but these are what we love and use.
*some products featured I received free of cost, but are my favorites and wanted to share them with my readers. No compensation was provided.

Thank you for this post! My sister is due in 9 weeks or less and I was not a breastfeeding mom, so I am not sure how to help her.
I breastfed both of our kids and am so glad I did. It takes a lot of time in the beginning getting used to it and helping baby to latch on, etc., but I loved the bonding and the extra time.
I think the two most important things to have are good bras and also nursing pads. My youngest baby 🙂 is 14, and they didn’t have a lot of these products back then, but I wish they did. A pillow worked really good for her to lay on in my lap to keep her propped higher.
i didn’t know anything about breastfeeding when we had my daughter, I thought everyone made too big a deal out of it and it should be a natural thing. little did I know… I was completely unprepared. I love the medela pump, I am going to be purchasing one when we are closer to having our second
Thanks for sharing all these great products! My daughter is going to be a first time mom soon and plans to breast feed, so this info is very helpful. I really like the nursing cover.
Another mommy thing I tried and failed at. I really did try. Lila was 3lbs 7oz and she just could not latch and they were bottle feeding her and she got used to the faster flow and easier sucking with the bottles. We did try pumping that was a disaster. Every time I pumped I cried hysterically… hormones? I had a great pumper too the exact one you mentioned Medela Pump In Style Advanced. STILL I hated it.. the sounds the feel the crying. I even got some breastmilk from a woman who was pumping like crazy but the freezing technique seemed to turn the milk… blech. So she got as much as she could and now she is almost two so… what can you do?
Great post. I have breastfed my kids but never heard of the boob design brand. I love how it shows no skin!! That is awesome. I wish I had some extra cash to get some now.

Our efforts brought over $38.4 million in refunds back into the Arizona economy including $9.5 million in Earned Income and Child Tax Credits to low income families.
Many of our dedicated volunteers are themselves senior citizens who take pride in serving their peers in this manner. They are thoroughly trained, tested and certified in tax law. Our training is focused on the tax needs of low and middle income taxpayers with special emphasis on the unique needs of senior citizens. However, we serve everyone in our community within the scope of our training.
Our sites are located in various libraries, senior and community centers and are generally open one or more days per week. Each site is equipped with computers enabling us to electronically file both state and federal tax returns. Each return is reviewed by a second certified counselor ensuring the accuracy of each return.
While we receive support from the AARP Foundation, membership in AARP is not a requirement to benefit from our services or to participate as a volunteer.
Being a resident of Kolkata, Digha has always been a favorite weekend spot ever since my childhood days. But although over the course of last 20 years the hotel scenario has changed drastically in Digha. I have never found a hotel in here that provides luxury accommodations & doesn’t burn a hole in the pocket either. Digha is a place where either you find rooms for either Rs 1000/- or below a night or upwards of Rs 2500/- a night.This gaping chasm in the range of the 1000/- to 2500/- room categories needed to be addressed.
I read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be something for you. The article is called silver-pearl1and is located atwww.hotelcoraldigha.com.

N.B. This review is not spoiler-free. Character death and imprisonment are central to the book and, hence, the review.
Early on in Joan Silber’s Improvement (Counterpoint, 2017), our protagonist, a young woman named Reyna, remarks on her boyfriend Boyd’s ability to console his loved ones by divining the wry humor in their personal tribulations, an act of attention and care that allows them to link their private pain to “the ever-expanding joke of human trouble.” This well-turned phrase doubles as a fitting summary of Silber’s main thematic concern as a fiction writer, particularly in her recent story cycles Ideas of Heaven (W. W. Norton, 2004) and Fools (W. W. Norton, 2013), which move between protagonists and settings across space and time in order to dramatize the ways in which the consequences of human actions ripple outwards throughout seemingly unconnected lives.
Improvement, billed as a novel, is Silber’s most ambitious attempt to explore this theme. It is bookended by the first-person narration of Reyna, a young, single mother living in Harlem. Reyna is raising four-year-old Oliver with the help of her aunt Kiki, who once lived in Turkey with a rug-selling husband for eight years and has cultivated a reputation as the family’s eccentric. She provides Reyna with childcare and much-needed reality checks. Among their sites of conflict is Reyna’s relationship with Boyd, who has recently been released from Rikers Island after three months on a drug charge. Kiki is sympathetic to Boyd’s troubles but believes that Reyna needs to travel the world rather than settling down with him. Cognizant of this, Reyna doesn’t tell her about Boyd and his friends’ plan to smuggle cigarettes from Virginia to New York in order to profit from the tax difference, a plan that Reyna worries will threaten Boyd’s probation. The operation runs smoothly for a few months, improving everyone’s financial situation and bringing Boyd and Reyna closer than ever, but things come to a head when Boyd asks Reyna, an excellent driver with no record, if she’ll drive the car for the upcoming trip. At first, she agrees, but her last-minute change of heart leaves Boyd’s friend Claude the only available driver. When a car accident kills him and injures their friend Maxwell, Reyna is blamed and shut out of her old life, including her relationship with Boyd.
This opening section is rendered in clean, enticing prose and packed with quotable observations, a hallmark of Silber’s style: Reyna reflects on her habit of “imagined meetings with ex-lovers … on urgent last requests from their sickbeds,” fueled by a desire to “show up in tribute to the substance of what we trashed” and a fascination with “the last triumph of behaving well.” Social observations are equally pithy, and grounded in Reyna’s understanding of her complex role as a white woman in a Black community: “Speeding White Woman Stopped on Highway with Two Colored Fellows. Or was that just the old South?”
But the novel’s finest accomplishment is structural, as, after quickly documenting the aftermath of Reyna’s exile, the narrative begins to move, in third-person narration, through the lives of those affected by Reyna’s split-second decision. We encounter Darisse, Claude’s new girlfriend from Virginia who never learns of his death and can only imagine he has lost interest, and Teddy, the trucker who was the other party in the accident; their attempts to move on while juggling the preexisting complications of their lives—ex- and current lovers, difficult children, financial troubles—never feel forced or random.
Readers who enjoyed the witty Kiki as well as those who found her enigmatic will enjoy the chapter detailing her years in 1970s Turkey, which balances an exploration of Turkish politics and society with Kiki’s growing realization that she wants leave her husband, who has recently moved them to the farm where he grew up, and return home to America. A trio of German antiquities smugglers whose brief stay on the farm provides the catalyst for the prodigal Kiki’s return stars in the next chapter, and the distorting effect of money and greed on their lives mirrors the opening exploration of cigarette smuggling in a thoughtful and never heavy-handed way: “All this greed and fury, all this grasping, where would it ever get Steffi?” The next chapter brings us back to Reyna’s New York, as the daughter of two of the smugglers, Monica, deals with the failing health of her mother Steffi, her malcontent partner Julian, and her friend and eyebrow tech, Lynnette, who we recognize as the soon-to-be-bereaved sister of Claude, Boyd’s friend who dies in the auto accident. The final chapter sees Reyna sell an antique rug given to her by Kiki and anonymously bequeath the proceeds to Lynnette out of guilt for her role in Claude’s death. Lynnette believes that an ex-boyfriend sent the money, which doesn’t frustrate Reyna but instead helps her to see what the reader has come to understand throughout the course of the novel, that the way we make sense of what happens to us has just as much to do with our ability to navigate the world as the course of fate: “Look what love did, even if it hadn’t done it.”
While these manifold plotlines, and the links between them, may seem like a lot to keep track of, Silber’s well-honed ability to tell a cohesive narrative in thirty or so pages (she was a two-time National Book Award nominee for her story collections Ideas of Heaven and Fools) makes each story distinct, and her narration’s genuine interest in the lives of such disparate characters makes a heuristic case for Silber’s casual approach to life’s big questions—“Was that what happened to old love, it turned into floating opinions and overcharged facts?” Silber’s use of third person for the middle section keeps her strong, recognizable narrative voice from seeming artificially similar across the stories, thus enabling her to use this voice to her advantage, as the throughline it creates emphasizes both the links between her characters’ situations and the idiosyncrasies that make them unique individuals.
Indeed, Silber’s command of voice is one of her great strengths as a storyteller, and perhaps the one that’s easiest to misunderstand: she adopts a wry, colloquial diction for first- and third-person alike, turning phrases so unpretentious and true-to-life that they may deceive the reader into thinking the work must have been easy. But Silber’s command of the text is nothing if not careful, and the simplicity of her prose belies her mastery of narrative architecture. As in Ideas of Heaven and Fools, Silber distills time’s forward march into as little as one sentence when necessary, in the interest of exploring one of her oeuvre’s primary concerns: the problem of how “time draws the shapes of stories,” as she puts it in her 2009 recent craft book, The Art of Time in Fiction (Graywolf Press). She continues, “I’m interested in how fates roll out over many years and am drawn to write fiction that takes on the task of compressing whole lifetimes into short stories or chapters.” This is the great accomplishment of Silber’s work, and of Improvement in particular. Far from just being, as many reviewers have characterized it, an exploration of the “butterfly effect,” Silber asks us to consider not only the intersections of multiple lives but the ongoingness of life well after the crucial juncture, and the moments when her characters realize the paradox that their fates have been set in motion, in ways they can yet understand only obliquely: “We were making great vows without the trouble of having to live with each other,” Reyna reflects when she finally runs into Boyd again, near the novel’s end. “But we were making them, standing on high ground to look down at the passage of time, years unfolding in the mortal valley below us.”
Silber herself has particular incentive to explore “the mortal valley” of time: at 72, her long-underappreciated work has begun to attain a critical mass of critical purchase. Improvement was awarded both the PEN/Faulkner Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction, two of the most prestigious American fiction prizes; in 2020, her debut novel, Household Words, which won the PEN/Hemingway Award, long a premier prize for first fiction, will turn 40. While her work has long been appreciated by literary insiders, it is this reviewer’s hope that the chorus for Improvement will cement her reputation as one of our finest fiction writers.
For her part, Silber, who I had the great good fortune to meet at her publisher’s booth at the Brooklyn Book Festival last month, was overjoyed at the reception of Improvement, gracious in the face of my star-struck babbling, and, most importantly, forthcoming about her next project, which will similarly tackle the vagaries of time in a composite story-novel form. Improvement’s many readers, myself included, are sure to be dazzled.

It’s not easy to get behind an Ash-less Evil Dead, but it’s possible. An Ash-less Evil Dead written by Diablo Cody though? I just don’t know. To be fair, the Juno writer has been hired only to rewrite Director Fede Alvarez’s script, and is thankfully not going into this project without set boundaries. According to Reelz, Cody has been instructed to keep the remake “grounded in reality,” and promised not to tart up what was once a cult classic with folk music or Jennifer’s Body-style ridiculousness.
Fans of The Evil Dead, I have some interesting news for you. First, Sam Raimi, creator of the original 1981 The Evil Dead, is involved in the upcoming remake of the film, scheduled for 2013. Sadly, the 2013 version does not include the beloved and darkly heroic Ash, originally played by Bruce Campbell.

My niece was watching a Minnesota Vikings verses the Dallas Cowboys Thursday night football game on NBC the other night. After a after a commercial, one of the paintings I did for the Minnesota Vikings, US Bank Stadium "The Purple People Eaters" flashed on the screen. I am not
sure in what context they showed my painting. or what kind of reference they made about it. She had a chance to photograph the television set with the painting featured on the screen and then posted the image on her Facebook account.
It is always a surprise to me when I am watching either a movie or television show and, all of a sudden, out of nowhere one of my paintings shows up on the screen. Generally I am supposed to be informed and sign a release for the use the image with the purchase of a painting. Then I am not informed. I have had images pop up a couple of times when something crops up completely out of context to the painting.
The oddest experience was when I was watching a horror - scary movie and in one of the opening scenes one of my paintings is in the background. I am not sure which movie but it was from the movie series. Paranormal Phenomenon I think it was called Paranormal Activity 2.
What is so odd about the painting is that it's of a guy who was walking past my studio with a parrot on his shoulder. I asked if I could photograph him with the parrot and took a few shots One of the photos was of him holding the parrot on his hand. I had sold the painting to an interior decorator/designer for a client. I totally forgot that I had done the painting then a couple of years later it appears in the movie.

Atlanta made a surprising free agent move in signing veteran safety Dashon Goldson. So why did the Falcons sign the 31-year-old and how important will he be this season? With rookie Keanu Neal suffering a knee injury and Kemal Ishmael being a less than attractive option as a starter, it makes sense that Dan Quinn decided to add another safety to the roster. Lets dice right into what all this means for the team.
When Keanu Neal went down Thursday the Falcons coaching staff was immediately concerned, not only for the health of the 1st round pick, but also because they realized the fragility of the the position as a whole. The Falcons had no real depth at strong safety. Now the Falcons do have Ishmael and Therezie, but even so, they don’t provide the depth of talent that Atlanta should want. Yes, Ishmael has shown flashes of greatness but he hasn’t been consistent about it and for Therezie, let’s not even talk about him starting. While the “Cadillac” does make some big plays from time to time, he’s just not consistent enough to be a starting player in this NFL. Not right now at least . Goldson has had an up-and-down career, but the Falcons know exactly what he will provide the team and that’s essential when staff are unsure about a key position.
Yes, his brings a lot to the table and that’s why the Falcons signed him. Goldson is a proven starter who has been impactful for every team he’s played for; he is a guy who, when needed, can make a big play in clutch moments. When he was with San Francisco he played some solid football and, in 2012, he earned a pro bowl spot. After that he was traded to Tampa where he slowed down and looked lethargic. Last year he was again traded, this time to Washington where he started 15 games and recorded 110 combined tackles, and an interception against the Saints that returned for a touchdown. Overall Goldson is a mixed bag. It has been proven that he can produce in key moments but it may not be his ability on the field that is most important for Atlanta.
Goldson should start over Ishmael until Neal is back healthy, but when Neal comes back from injury Goldson will begin his most important role on the team. Mentoring the young rookie. Goldson will work with the young and immensely talented rookie and start to teach him the ins and outs of being a starting safety in the NFL. He’ll hopefully be able to show Neal how to bait a QB, or dissect a play before it even begins. The experience that Goldson has as a starter should be absorbed by Neal, and may lessen his growing pains in the NFL.
All in all, the Dashon Goldson signing should be a fairly good one for Atlanta. He provides veteran leadership, has had proven success and will definitely be able to fill in for Neal until he’s healthy. He’s a good guy as well, let’s hope it doesn’t take him too long to settle in to the loud city of Atlanta, and lets welcome him with open arms Falcons nation.

Hiroshi’s dream was to make his wife Seiko happy. They travelled all the way from Japan to create wonderful wedding photos and memories. We arranged beautiful wedding gown for Seiko, got her a pretty bouquet and they both enjoyed being picked up by a funky red vintage car. Petr Pelucha knew exactly where to take them – Prague offers so much...
Let’s get warm and cozy and look back at one of the hottest days of last summer that happened to be wedding day of a the nicest British-Canadian couple Laura & Ryan.
Christmas lights, fearless red dress of the Bride, hot punch and lot of kisses, holding hands and dancing.. not only that was a wedding day of Jenny & Joel in Prague.
The important question we often get from our clients – will my wedding in Prague be legally valid in my home country? Yes, your wedding will be legally valid and recognized worldwide and we will make the process easy for you.
Prague… Beautiful and romantic city in the heart of Europe. It’s not only an ideal place for your wedding, but also perfect for your full of deep emotions proposal.

We are happy to have a good friend Vladka Fremuthova, the owner of the company “Meadows”, so we are proud to present you another Czech brand after “27Jewelry”.
At our job, we sometimes meet creative Brides who wish to plan and design their whole wedding alone without hiring a wedding agency. This brought us to an idea to prepare a stylish workshop for Brides-to be.
Prague is a city for Art Nouveau lovers.. Megan & Paul’s vintage style British wedding in Prague took place in the early fall and even the Indian summer weather was perfect..
Didi, originally from South Africa and Jiri, originally from Czech met while working on a cruise ship and they spend most of their year working in warm places. They have decided for a smaller intimate wedding in the winter time in Prague and hoped for a snow kissed wedding.
It took a few trips from London to Prague, many skype chats with the couple’s little son Leo climbing over the laptop and some amount of emails. But at the end Babsi & Luke’s dream came true – they found their perfect wedding venues that were supposed to absolutely „wow“ their wedding guests. It was a difficult choice as you all know, Prague is magical everywhere you look. Especially in late November with Advent spirit in the air.
Sara and Eric’s winter romantic wedding was a wonderful ending of the season and year 2014. Their wedding took place on December 30th in Prague, in small cozy hidden chapel in the most romantic part of Prague, Kampa.
Read what our friend Uma wrote about decorations for winter outdoor weddings in Prague that we love so much because of their special atmosphere.
While winters in cities like Prague can be bitterly cold, but that doesn’t mean that you have to discard this season for a wedding. If you are getting married, the winter season can be a truly beautiful backdrop for your wedding. Just imagine how romantic a blanket of crisp white snow will be as a backdrop when you exchange your vows.
Happy New Year and hope you are all having a great beginning of 2011. We have a busy month behind us; this winter we were very happy to have many December weddings and it was a wonderful ending of the year.
Planning Tara & Ryan’s wedding was so much fun. This lovely Canadian- Sri Lankan couple got officially married in Canada a while ago but now wanted to have the proper big white wedding with families involved. Since the couple has families spread literally all over the world they decided to meet in the middle – in Prague, as we Czechs like to say, in the heart of Europe :-). Families and friends from both sides had to travel miles to get here but what Tara & Ryan prepared for them, was definitely worth it.
Fantasy Football Leagues have been growing in popularity and marketers have taken notice. This is why the teaming of Yahoo Sports and Buffalo Wild Wings to create National Draft Day is branding gold and a major win for both companies. Is this Fantasy Draft Day more exciting for fan than the NFL Draft?
Buffalo Wild Wings and Yahoo! Sports are creating the ultimate kickoff to fantasy football season. The Buffalo Wild Wings and Yahoo! Sports Fantasy Football National Draft Day will be the first-of-its-kind “holiday” and will take place Saturday, Aug. 24, all across the nation.
Total viewership of the first round of the draft on ESPN and NFL Network totaled a combined 20 million viewers, according to The Nielsen Company, making it the most-watched cable show of the night. The combined average for ESPN and NFL Network was 7.7 million, almost doubling the History Channel's "Swamp People" (4 million viewers), the next-most watched cable program on that Thursday. Read more on the NFL's Media Blitz
The legend goes that when a fledgling ESPN asked NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to televise the 1980 NFL Draft, even the PR-savvy Mr. Rozelle doubted anybody would tune in.
Fast-forward 33 years and John Brody, senior VP-sponsorship and sales for the NFL, expected 50 million viewers to watch the three-day event across ESPN, NFL Network and NFL Mobile last Thursday through Saturday nights.
NHS Surrey has been fined £200,000 by data regulators over the loss of sensitive information about more than 3,000 patients. Thousands of children's patient records were found on a second-hand NHS computer that was auctioned on eBay, the BBC understands.
Regulators said NHS Surrey failed to check that a data destruction company had properly disposed of the records. Three further computers that had been sold on eBay contained sensitive data.
UK watchdog the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) imposed the fine on the trust after patients across Surrey were affected by the data loss.
"The facts of this breach are truly shocking," ICO head of enforcement Stephen Eckersley said in a statement. "NHS Surrey chose to leave an approved provider and handed over thousands of patients' details to a company without checking that the information had been securely deleted, the result was that patients' information was effectively being sold online."
At the time NHS Surrey contacted patients involved to make them aware of the data breach. "This case is currently the subject of legal proceedings."
The breach was one of the most serious that the ICO had seen, the data watchdog added. NHS Surrey was alerted to the data loss by a member of the public who had purchased an old NHS computer and found patient records.
Upon investigation, the trust discovered the computer contained the health records of 2,000 children and 900 adults, plus a number of NHS human resources records. A further 39 computers that had been sold by the data destruction company were recovered during the course of the investigation, with sensitive records found on three of the hard disks.
The data destruction company had offered free disposal of the computers in exchange for the sale of salvageable materials. The company promised to crush the computer hard disks using an industrial guillotine, but NHS Surrey failed to monitor the destruction process, the ICO ruled, and did not have a contract in place that explained the legal requirements of the data destruction.
In this instance had a third party financial loss arisen directly from the loss of the third party data then a cyber-liability insurance policy would have responded and paid all sums that you may become legally obliged to pay, including claimants cost and expenses, but not fines imposed.

Among a few things that are truly the identity of any nation, national anthem holds a significant position. Along with the national flag, it represents the country throughout the world and adds to the national pride. It is basically a patriotic hymn or other song adopted by a nation for use on public or state occasions and is the individuality of any state.
Coming back home, Pakistan’s national anthem, written by Hafeez Jalandhari, has always been a subject of criticism as it is completely in Farsi (Persian), rendering it incomprehensible for majority of Pakistanis. While the current national anthem is hardly approved, Pakistan’s first national anthem remains a mystery and just a few people know the existence of another national anthem approved by founding father Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah (R.A) prior to Hafeez Jalandhari’s ‘Pak Sar Zameen Shaad Baad’.
Jagan Nath Azad, a Lahore based Urdu poet commissioned the first national anthem of Pakistan just three days before the independence on 11th August 1947 at the behest of M.A. Jinnah. According to a Professor of History hail to University of Karachi, Jagan Nath was equally excited and amazed when came to know that Jinnah wanted him to commission Pakistan’s national anthem regardless of his religious identity.
About a year and a half after the partition, after Mr Jinnah’s death in September, 1948, the government of Pakistan, headed by its first Muslim Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, decided to discard the anthem. National Anthem Committee was formed in December, 1948 to recommend new anthem.
However, unfortunately, we do not have any account pertaining to the first national anthem in our history books. With all these accessible evidences, none of the historians ever tried to discover the fact that what prompted the then leaders of Pakistan to discard the first national anthem as envisioned by Mohammad Ali Jinnah to get it written by a non-Muslim writer in Urdu.
The question arises: what prompted the then government to discard Azad’s ‘Aye sar zameen-i-paak’ that was also in our national language? And it remains unanswered.
It is common observation that cognizance of a minor child to an adult person is restricted to the given facts that Hafeez Jalandhari commissioned the first national anthem of Pakistan. Misleading people is a crime but concealing historical facts to its nation is beyond the criminal act. One must think about it with all dimensions opened.
I always wondered that why our national anthem was in Farsi despite Urdu being the national language. In fact, there were other big languages as bengali and punjabi……at tha time. we should also have national anthem translated in to all regional languages of Pakistan… Moeed
which was adopted in 1950. Then the poets were invited to write appropriately worded lyrics fitting the music. More than 700 contestants had submitted their lyrics out of which the National Anthem Committee had selected the lyrics written by Hafiz Jalandhari. The National Anthem was then officially adopted by the Government. The whole exercise took more than 4 years and Radio Pakistan had broadcasted it for the first time on 14th August 1954.
It was years ago that I had learnt to my shock that Pakistan’s National Anthem is a replacement of one composed by a Lahorite non-Muslim poet, Jagan Nath Azad. Urdu diction of abandoned national anthem is lucid and its imagery simple.How it was expedient to annul it, is a tantalizing question.
If you read through our current national anthem, It contains mostly urdu words and has a more balanced verse.
Deception is norm in our history. I still remember, when I was in 4th grade in 1957, we used to read the history (Muashtarti Uloom). It had a chapter on Quid-e-Azam, which had the information “Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born in a small town “Jhiruk” of Distt. Thatta on 25 Dec. Come 1958, and changed to Karachi:):)
Roohan Ahmed! I think you have some much free time to write a blog on this subject. WE have so many other important issues, it would be better you select some important topic instead of bothering about our national anthem. Mind your business please and dont waste yours and the peoples time.
The national anthem had to be composed in a hurry in 1950 because of the impending state visit of the Shah of Iran. President Sukarno had been the first head of state to make a state visit and there had been no Pakistani national anthem to play upon his arrival. A.G. Chagla produced his beautiful composition within a few weeks, in time for the Shah’s visit. The lyrics were added later through a process described in M. Saeed’s comment. By the way there is one line of Urdu in the anthem (Pak sarzameen ka nizam)!
well urdu comes from several different languages including turkish, arabic and persian, so there is nothing wrong with the national anthem being in persian if it conveys our ideology. it is clear to see why the older one was rejected, as it sounds simple, whereas the current one literally gives me goosebumps and awakens the patriot in me, not to mention that it also sounds better to the ears. it should be part of our education system and school curriculum to explain the national anthem to children so that they understand what it is about, so that they dont just sing empty words in school assembly etc

I’m quite keen on my orange squash as most of you know. Those of you who know me well will also know my particular fondness of Robinson’s Orange Squash.
Recently they have changed their label from the one in the photo. Why change a label? To attract attention to the product to re-promote it? To accompany a change in flavour or ingredients?
My guess is the latter because it is now necessary to dilute the cordial in slightly different proportions in order to remove the slight aftertaste of pinapple that is otherwise noticable. When I first tried the ‘new’ orange squash I thought I’d picked up the wrong bottle from the supermarket as Robinson’s do indeed sell an orange and pinapple version….
Anyway, I checked and I definitely have the orange (no added sugar) squash and with a little bit of experimentation as to proportions of cordial to water it’s all sorted.
The point of this entry….. none really other than to fill time and hopefully keep you amused for all of 2 minutes!!
When I did this to start with, it said it needed to know the dimension of the bounding box so I altered it to \includegraphics[bb = 4 4 5 5]{Normalisedzscores.pdf} which runs fine, but in DVi I get the following error message:
Last year I wrote my dissertation in TeX. This was a major faff as I was incapable of making contents pages and bibliographies in it. Therefore I’ve decided to learn how to use LaTeX. So far, it’s great! I’ve worked out contents and bibiliographies without any bother and can do tables and everything I need. However, graphics seem to be beyond me! I’ve got the graphics saved as .wmf as they were what I needed for TeX, however, it seems that these are unsuitable for LaTeX. Equally, I’ve tried converting them to .jpg and .pdf and using pdflatex in the latter case, but it still won’t put graphics into my document.
Apparently, because I’m 21 and want to be treated like an adult, I have to act like one. It appears that in order to act like an adult you have to be parted from nearly 100 soft toys and redesign your room so that it looks like a room in a show house and not like a room anyone lives in.
At least my 30 favourites are safe (currently in a box waiting to go back to university which isn’t great, but at least they’ve avoided being sold.)
Today I had the most comedy phone conversation ever. I dialled the relevant number and after two rings, a voice announced “I’m sorry all our operators are busy at present. Please hold until the next available member of staff becomes available. You are number zero in the queue.” This is itself is amusing as how is it possible to have an empty queue? Also, if I’m in an empty queue why is noone answering the phone?!
A few minutes later my call was answered. The helpdesk I was ringing is one which sorts all things technology based. Consequently I was very surprised when they said they weren’t reading emails today. (I sent them an email initially to explain the problems as that’s what I was told to do when I rang them the first time.)
Why are Sunday evenings so gloomy? I went out for dinner this evening, however, I was home by 9.00 so have had to fill the remaining hours before I can accept defeat and go to bed ready to wake up for another day’s revision.
MSN’s quiet today too, as it is every weekend. I guess people have more of a social life than I do. I finished another book today though and have been watching the snooker, so I can’t grumble too much.
Bank holiday tomorrow. It’s just like a Sunday all over again which isn’t a good thing in my opinion. All of you who work Monday to Friday will no doubt dispute that point, but for someone like me who works everyday, Bank holidays are just another reason for places to be shut and people to be busy doing things they want to do as opposed to have to do!
MONDAY 26th February (week 8), 7pm in the Butterworth Hall within Warwick Arts Centre, the University of Warwick Wind Orchestra and massed choir of 250 7-11 children from local schools come together to perform for your entertainment. We will be playing pieces ranging from Hobbits from Lord of the Rings, to a medley of Beatles songs. Other tunes include ‘The Future’s in Our Hands’ featuring the massed choir and Siyahamba as well as My Fair Lady medley, Scramble! by Nigel Hess, Overture to ‘Candide’, Holsts’ first suite in Eb….. Something for everyone!
Has anyone listened to the Gladiator soundtrack recently? If so, have you noticed the uncanny resemblence of one of the tracks to the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack? I know that Klaus Badelt was involved in the score production for Gladiator, but did he really use the same theme in both soundtracks?
A slightly less geeky observation: drinking too much alcohol isn’t good; for the person, the people they are with and the people that are around them. To explain, a party of promers who set up their rug next to our ‘camp’ came dressed in their finery (black ties and silly dresses.) They all then consumed lots of alcohol, but one man in particular became very drunk to the level of almost being unconcious. Personally I can’t see the point, but that is just me.
I went on holiday to the Lake District with Mum's Mum, Mum's Mum's Mum and Dad and Tom and Babe and Patch. It was very fun.

After much recent speculation, there have been exciting developments in the Union. Yes, finally the Union has seen the light and added WORD UP to their collection of quiz games. Look out for LuckySeven™ dominating the high score table.
Went out to grad and event in the Cooler last night-Indian Event of some kind- only 4 of use pale skinned mob in there-clearly they had flocked from all arouned to witness the moooves pulled of by Jambon, James, Chattie and myself. However, rather disappointly the event was somewhat tainted for me, as once again Jamie neglected to wear his white leather jacket- I look forward to the spring when he will once again become a major player on the fashion scene. Also, expect him to wear sunglasses all year around like the Greeks. Good time was had by all, although there has been much whinging about hangovers this morning-not balla!

Bad conditions of mobility and accessibility to jobs and services in most metropolitan regions in developing countries are a key development issue. Besides the negative effects on the wellbeing of their populations associated with traffic congestion and time spent on transportation, the latter mean economic losses in terms of waste of human and material resources.
That led me to read with much interest a recent book – available on Google Play - on the impact of rail-based networks in São Paulo and Mumbai [1] written by Jorge Rebelo, a transport specialist who worked for more than 25 years at the World Bank. São Paulo and Mumbai are both mega-metropolitan regions with about 20 million inhabitants and in dire need of quick solutions for better mobility and accessibility for their populations. As their population and income grew, auto and motorcycle ownership and their use also increased in both cities. Their mass transport systems are overloaded and travelling conditions are reaching their limit or are above their limit at peak-hours. Congestion is becoming unbearable in these two megacities and any new infrastructure requires relocation of houses and businesses, a very sensitive issue which in turn demands careful planning and heavy investment.
Both Mumbai and São Paulo metropolitan regions have extensive suburban railway networks dating from the 19th century that are now serving primarily a huge number of mostly low-income commuters every day. Built initially for transportation of freight and intercity passengers, these railways are now major commuter networks which are used by millions of passengers every day. According to Rebelo, both mega-metropolitan regions have delayed too long the substantial extension of their subways and other rail based systems either because of lack of coordination between levels of government and/or unreliable financing mechanisms which did not allow the required continuity to ensure annual additions to their rail based systems. The price for having procrastinated in facing those challenges has been huge!
Increasing challenges with mobility are of course not unique to those two mega-metropolises. Nineteen of the twenty-six largest [2]metropolitan areas in the world are in non-advanced economies and most of them have suffered from a mismatch between, on the one hand, the fast dynamics of densification and transformation of space use and, on the other, the slower pace of institutional adaptation and/or investment finance to cope with the evolution of transportation needs. Mobility difficulties have become more intense even where population dynamics and rural-urban migration are not major factors, like in Russia, as approached by JungEun Oh and Kenneth Gwilliam [3] in a recent World Bank review of the urban transport sector in the Russian Federation:
“Russian cities are undergoing critical economic and social changes that affect the performance and condition of their urban transport systems. While the population of most large cities in Russia (over one million residents) has remained relatively unchanged over the last decade, the average income of the urban dwellers has sharply increased. The number of private cars per capita has increased rapidly, generating a demand for urban mobility which is increasingly difficult to meet.”
Through the long series of projects and analyses with which the World Bank has been supporting urban transport improvements in developing countries over the years – openly accessible on www.worldbank.org [4] – one can notice how challenges associated with the mismatch between evolution of urban transport needs and institutional and investment finance responses are widespread in the developing world. One can also see how far ago those challenges had already become significant. For instance, a World Bank appraisal report [5] on a project in Rio de Janeiro more than 20 years ago stated the following:
“Urban Transportation is in a crisis in Brazil. Although the nation has invested heavily in the sector over the past 15 years, the effective demand for urban transport services particularly in major metropolitan regions (MRs), increased by about 82% in the last decade, and under present pricing policies, exceeds the existing peak hour supply in most MRs. To add to this capacity shortage, the Brazilian urban transport sector suffers from institutional problems due to a lack of coordination between the three levels of government responsible for urban transport in the MRs.”
Not by chance, the issue of coordination between levels of government is highlighted in a set of policy proposals argued in Rebelo’s book - one that certainly serves as a reference for most metropolitan areas in developing countries. First and foremost, it is fundamental to establish some sort of real, effective Metropolitan Authority as a coordinator of long-term planning, evaluation and prioritization of new investments and coordination of their tariff and subsidy policy. This has also been pinpointed in a recent World Bank report - Institutional Labyrinth [6]:
“Typically, multiple agencies, at different levels of government, are involved in the management and delivery of urban transport infrastructure and services. More often than not, there is little or no coordination among them. This results in duplication and inefficiency in the use of resources and poor-quality services. The need for institutional coordination across space and function is increasingly being recognized as critical to developing an integrated and comprehensive urban transport system.”
The rapid transformation of space use and densification of connections between urban areas tends to turn previous transport- and urban-related political and administrative mandates obsolete and dysfunctional. Natural political inertia or resistance then often becomes a hindrance to building some sort of new, effective authority able to cope with the evolving metropolitan reality.
Some other recommendations follow in Rebelo’s book. For instance, there should be a search for financing mechanisms that are less dependent on floating government general budgets. A greater use of Public-Private Partnerships seems to be a trend in many parts of the world, and that might require operating subsidies. Therefore, financing mechanisms to guarantee the payment on time of those subsidies must be in place to avoid situations where concessions risk failing when operating subsidies are not paid on time. Revenues from advertising, use of station space, real estate developments around stations and urban operations can also be carefully planned.
Another key consideration is to strongly encourage the transparency of the bidding and evaluation process to foster international competitiveness and decrease costs. It also seems advisable to create an inventory of projects contained in the long-term strategy well beyond preliminary design stages. That would cut in the implementation schedule and make projects more attractive from a political standpoint. Finally, in most cases probably with the help of the judiciary, an effort must be made to find ways to simplify and accelerate expropriation/resettlement processes that may be deemed as necessary. All these recommended procedures require a definition of lines of authority appropriate to the evolving metropolitan reality.
The reality is some of the developing world’s transport infrastructures are beyond simple congestion; they are in danger of complete collapse or paralysis. There is reason to believe, however, that authorities in many countries have got the message and started to act more decisively. For instance, Mumbai just had its first monorail inaugurated and there are other rail and metro projects underway under the leadership of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are also undertaking substantial programs to try to address their mobility issues, and it’s high time they do it. Pay-offs from adjusting institutions and finance to the urban dynamics are clearly huge. It’s time to unclog the arteries of urban transport now to prevent stroke and paralysis tomorrow!
Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels says a state budget plan crafted this week by state Senate Republicans spends too much and relies too much on federal stimulus money.
The two-year plan that cleared the GOP-led Senate Appropriations Commiteee Thursday spends about $2 billion in stimulus funds, much of it on education.
Daniels, who’s also a Republican, says he has many concerns about the budget, but the stimulus element is the most troubling.
“I have strong views but i’m prepared to set many of those, or perhaps all of those aside, in pursuit of the main goal, which is to protect education and vital services two years from now, and to protect taxpayers,” Daniels said Friday

And now there is no Community Life. With it’s Good Deeds and Reflections by News photographers, volunteer spotlight, and other random stuff. Update: Some of these elements, like the Engagement Announcements, Reflection, Good Causes and Faces in the Crowd are now in a “Milestones” section of the Sunday News.
So I am left to wonder: what is the News’ grand plan? What makes a local paper good and what makes people want to read it? Because every time the News takes away local news I scratch my head.
But I am not in the print media business and I know it is not as easy as just continuing to provide content that the majority of people don’t want to read at the same time that your costs keep increasing.
They are moving all of the community sections to the Sunday paper. Which annoys me because now I’ll have to get the Sunday paper and spend $1.50 when I used to be able to just buy the Saturday paper for 50 cents and not deal with all the ads. Which is exactly the reason they are moving it to Sunday so they can get the circulation and advertising rates. It annoys me, but it makes sense for the paper.
But I do keep hoping someone is going to start a good, community-oriented newspaper soon and then I won’t ever have to read the News again.
Word. I’m a 30-something :) who gets the paper delivered every day, and I have noticed my reading time decreasing. Today, I separated the ads and “weighed” what was left…not so much (even with the new “connections” section). I am a fast reader, but it took me less than 1/2 hour to get through the paper today.
I second Juliew’s call for a community-oriented paper…with all of the “locavore” stuff going on now (which is a good thing, imho), this would be a prime time for some creative person to get the ball rolling….
I’m a newspaper addict. Can’t live without my morning New York Times. Used to be, I also required my afternoon Ann Arbor News fix. I’d been subscribing for 20 years.
But last spring, I discovered that I was reading everything I wanted in the paper on the journey from my front door to my kitchen table. In addition to all the points already made, I will note that many of their excellent local reporters are gone. So I regretfully canceled my subscription a few months ago. I try to catch up on the headline news online and probably miss some things.
Note that the January Ann Arbor Observer reports that the News has had a 20% decline in circulation since 2000.
Nancy’s headline has a sad double entendre. In order to have a vital community life, we need our local newspaper.
This is an induwtry-wide trend…circulation is down at almost every newspaper in the nation. People get news online, young people don’t (in general) buy newspapers.
The problem is compounded at the AA News by the fact that it is not a good paper. Some of the best local reporters, those that actually dug around and found news, are gone. Now we’re left with people like Geoff Larcom who sounds bored in all his columns and reports. Like ‘been there, done that, i know everything there is to know, just ask.’
The paper is stale because the same people have been running it for too long, with no new blood, no fresh perspective, no burning desire to AA in a different light.
It is a shame that a college town has such a lousy paper. Oh, and it’s not like the Observer is winning any Pulitzers or anything.
It’s a big problem with no obvious solution. There is no reason whatsoever to get the AA News for most of the content. All of the non-local news, which is most of the paper, is available in better form and for free on line. Classified ads are better online also. But local news is labor-intensive and expensive to gather and circulation and ad-revenues are declining.
I suspect that ultimately local papers may be replaced by local, unpaid wikipedia-style citizen journalism efforts. And, to be honest, we might be better served by that model.
Re post # 2 – Thanks David, thought I was just nutty and missed that the Biz section was missing (I am nutty but not in this case). I’m torn – if I didn’t bring the paper in to work for all my co-workers to read I’d seriously consider not renewing my subscription. But there’s a part of me that says you got to support the local rag. Just for demographics sake – 37 YO here. I’m not happy about the trend in the newspaper industry but I’m biased, I work in the printing industry. God knows I get a sizeable majority of my info from the internet. Shall we also bemoan the horrible local news coverage on radio and TV? Detroit news coverage is a topic in and of itself…
Competition is always healthy and we need it more now then ever. I thought the new Sunday attempt, while the color photos are nice, I don’t really need to see a photo of someone’s new baby. It was a very small town rip off of the NYT’s Style section of the weddings.
With their recent layoffs and their claim to being a regional paper, obviously to increase their sales, there is very little Ann Arbor stories anymore. If only someone had the dollars to start and support even a weekly edition that was packed with local info it would have to be better then what we have now. I agree with Vivienne, it takes all of 5 minutes to read the local stories and even less if you consider any of the stories outside Ann Arbor non-local. The editor has been around a very long time. New blood maybe?
Re: #7, I’ll take your suggestion, Thomas, and I will bemoan TV coverage from Detroit. Oy. Except for UM football time and the occasional major crime, they forget that we exist. I teach school in Detroit, and when some folks hear where I live, they act like I’m flying in from the opposite side of Jupiter. (Really, it’s about 40 minutes away—not that far at all).
One thing that I do dig about the AANews is the crossword puzzles and how they are super easy on Monday (when, presumably, we are all half brain-dead) and then get progressively harder during the week until we reach Saturday, when the answers are like 37 boxes long. At least, my simple mind thinks they get harder…others may not agree :)
You are right, Patti, they DO get harder. Theoretically, we are supposed to have more time on Saturday.
Newspapers are trying to “do more with less.” Does anyone else watch “The Wire”? Life imitates art. There used to be reporters who had beats and now there are so few reporters that they all have to cover everything and most of them have not been here very long and don’t know the history anyway. I am somewhat suspicious of all the boo-hooing in the media industry since newspapers were making lots of money 25 years ago when I was a reporter and we still got paid squat!

West Midlands Fire Service have this morning confirmed that a fire which destroyed the roof of The Cock Inn yesterday (Tuesday 10th October) was arson.
Firefighters were called to the vacant and derelict The Cock Inn in Rubery Lane at just after 6pm to reports of fire in the first floor of the building.
Crews from Northfield and Kings Norton tackled the blaze and a hydraulic platform was used to access the roof.
Firefighters spent several hours at the site last night and have returned to check the property this morning to verify that the incident is concluded.
Northfield Station Commander Lee Baker tweeted yesterday that empty buildings pose a risk of anti-social behaviour and arson, which presents dangers for the public and firefighters.
It is said that the RAF were billeted at The Cock Inn during WWII and operated barrage balloons at Rubery Quarry, to protect the factories in Longbridge.
Last year, Malvern Estates PLC, alongside Unique Pub Properties PLC, were refused permission to develop the former coaching inn site as part of a 12 property housing development.
Developers resubmitted plans in January this year to address the council’s initial concerns regarding access onto the development and the fact that trees under a Tree Preservation Order would be affected.
However, developers withdrew this application before it went before a planning committee and are expected to submit an application for an alternative site use in the near future.
Cllr Ian Cruise (Longbridge, Independent) said he was “disappointed” to learn about the fire and thanked fire crews for their speedy response. He said: “I am aware Northfield Fire Station Commander Lee Baker has been working with the owner to put in place a more secure perimeter fence and secure the property. Sadly despite this, the perimeter was breached and the building set alight.”
He added: “As with the club house at North Worcestershire Golf Course, I’m saddened that another building of heritage in our local area has been left standing idle and open to arson and criminal damage. It is another example of another historic public house being damaged by arson instead of being refurbished or converted, rather than demolished.”
Cllr Cruise urged the owners of the property to secure the site in order to prevent further incidents.

quote – “Cllr Cruise urged the owners of the property to secure the site in order to prevent further incidents.”
All very well but the boards that were put up around the perimeter of the pub and carpark a few months ago, have been slowly removed, allowing access. I also seem to recall a year or so ago concrete pillars were put up around the entrance of the carpark, but again it was breached, this time by Travellers, who pitched their caravans in the car park for about a week or so.
So I don’t see how they can really secure that area off until such time the owners refurb or demolish the pub.

Note This review does not include a case of t(2;12)(p12;p13) found in myeloid malignancy (Lai et al., 1995), a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with a t(12;14)(p13;q32) and IgH/ETV6 involvement (Lu et al., 2002); five cases of t(12;22)(p13;q11), not herein included either, have also been described in lymphoid malignancies, but with an unknown CCND2 status (see Mitelman database). Finally, there are a number of chronic myeloid leukemia aberrant translocations with t(12;22), which again represent other diseases.
Phenotype / cell stem origin The cases of mantle cell lymphomas with the above translocations were typical mantle cell cases, with CD5+, CD20+, CD10-, CD23- expression, except for the lack of CCND1 expression.
Clinics The patients are in stage IV of the disease, with a nodular, or nodular/diffuse pattern. There was 3 male and 2 female patients, aged 33, 52, 65, 70, and ? years.
Prognosis Data is missing in most cases; the two patients with data on prognosis died: the patient with Richter disease, and a MCL case, who died 64 months after diagnosis.
Cytogenetics Morphological There was two cases of t(2;12), one case of cryptic t(12;14), one case of t(12;22), and one case with no metaphase.
Additional anomalies +3 was found in two cases, +21 in one case, a complex karyotype in one case, and +12 and a t(14;19)(q32;q13) in the CLL/Richter case.
Protein CCND2 promotes cell cycle progression at the G1/S start transition. Interacts with CDK4 and CDK6. CCND2 is activated through B-cell antigen receptor-induced, and CD19-induced signal transduction pathways, including the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway, the PLC gamma pathway, and the IKK/NF-KB pathway. CCND2 is critical in B-cell development (review in Chiles, 2004).

The Founder and Editor-in-Chief of Republic TV tells Best Media Info that he doesn’t even know if his channel is running on multiple frequencies. Interesting read…
Frankly speaking, it is no fun talking with Arnab Goswami if you think you can put forth a few tough questions. He is more than humble off-air but make no mistake, you should not be on the other side. To be fair, I wanted a headline as a reporter and got that but I also wanted to complete my interview. There is no brainer in guessing that you can complete an interview only if you are able to complete a full tough question. Will Goswami let that ever happen is the point.
Amidst the controversies surrounding the usage of multiple frequencies, Goswami has decided to not join NBA in its current form.
Speaking to (not with) Best Media Info, Goswami expressed his intention towards establishing a parallel body like NBA that will represent the true interest of media owners and media professionals in this country. He also denied charges of running his Republic TV on multiple frequencies.
Did you expect better viewership considering how you tried to attract Hinglish/Hindi-speaking viewers to Republic?
We have always been Hinglish to that extent. But I am amused by the panic reaction of Times Now, which changed into a Hindi channel for an hour. Now, I should go to TRAI and BARC and say that they should not be placed in the English channel category. Look at the desperation and fear that they have gone Hindi in the mornings. The news story today is that the new entrant has defeated the Bennett Coleman Group.
Critics and naysayers say that this is just a flash and whether Arnab will be able to continue is a question. Would you be able to sustain this viewership?
Won’t the advertisers take your success with a pinch of salt, especially after multiple frequency controversy?
Absolutely not. India Today and Times Now are experts in double frequency. We are a free-to-air (FTA) channel. Anybody can carry us anywhere. The concern should be when pay channels are on double frequency. So, the NBA should evaluate whether there’s a conflict of interest between the executives of NBA in their corporate roles and representatives of a body. If pay channels are on double frequency, you should ask questions. In any case, if they want to be cry-babies now, after the ratings, I don’t think a channel with seven per cent frequency like India Today, even with 100 frequencies, would have been able to match our viewership.
You have had a phenomenal viewership and possibly, you would still have been on top without multiple LCNs.
We are an FTA. I don’t know what multiple frequencies everyone is talking about. People can carry us anywhere. People at Havana or in the US, you can downlink our channel. I have no control over where my channel goes. If people like our channel and want to put us at 100 locations, we can’t help it.
If it was used as a sampling and marketing tool for the short term, won’t it be embarrassing if the numbers fall drastically?
NBA had sent a letter to BARC to not release your data because of multiple feeds. How do you react to that?
We are an FTA non-encrypted channel. As I said, we have no control over where we’re carried. I think it’s a desperate measure. Since there is a genuine conflict of interest between the office bearers of the NBA and their corporate roles, we must be careful. Because the head of the NBA is also the CEO of TV Today group and the vice-president of NBA is the CEO of the Times Network. They are the most affected by the ratings and hence this raises a very serious question about the conflict of interest in their positions.
It’s also surprising that they were taking all these actions before the ratings came out. What is more surprising is that they have not disclosed the fact that Times network and India Today have dual frequencies at multiple places. They have concealed their own dual frequencies and attacked us. I think it is unfair and it is a reflection of growing nervousness of some of these players, and we are not affected by this.
We have not got any independent communication from TRAI yet. But I think the TRAI should investigate the dual frequencies used by the India Today group presently and in the past. There have been complaints that when they re-launched their channel, they have dual frequencies. At that point in time, the NBA did not say that the ratings should not be released. Hence, I say that people are misusing their positions in NBA and thereby, NBA has lost its stature, respect.
I was quite sure that we would be on top. I don’t want to get into this; I would rather focus on my stories.
Dual frequencies have been used as a marketing tool. In my view, this is not the area of jurisdiction of the TRAI.
You reacted sharply about NBA’s complaint to TRAI and its attempt to postpone the viewership data but how do you defend their concerns? By saying they also did multiple frequencies in the past, do you mean two wrongs can make a right?
I am not responsible for what they do. You must check out from sources how many dual frequencies India Today and Aaj Tak are running right now and the number of double frequency that Times Now has at the moment. After this, complaining about someone else is ridiculous. That’s why the credibility of NBA is under doubt. There’s misuse of position.
Things will be fine one day and as we know Arnab does not do away with grudges easily, could we safely say you won’t be a part of NBA in its current form?
I don’t find any need to join NBA because the credibility of the NBA is severely compromised. The way in which the CEO of the India Today network and one or two CEOs of other competing channels misuse the association to push their own agendas, NBA is in tatters today. At this stage, therefore, there is no need to join NBA.
NBA today is a toothless organisation that has become a cabal of a few companies using it to their benefit. Who does NBA represent today? It represents four to five companies that have been crying foul against all these issues. I don’t think this kind of organisation has any relevance today in India.
It is sad and disappointing for me because I was instrumental in setting up the NBA. I had gone to Mr Harish Salve and drafted the rules and regulation of the NBA. What it has become today is not why NBA had come together. It was built to create high standards for journalism.
I think there is a greater need for a Centre for Indian Journalism (CIJ) that will represent the true interest of media owners and media professionals in this country and I do intend to work in that direction.
Now that all your competitors are out from BARC saying let Republic TV enjoy 100% viewership, how do you view this development?
They are frustrated. I can’t explain why they are frustrated. Some of them have got seven per cent channel share. Generally, what I do know is their pressure tactics are not good. BARC has existed for some time. You can’t say BARC is good when your ratings are good and BARC is bad when the ratings are bad. That’s not the right thing to do.
My job is to run a channel and put the news up. I am not going to battle it out with other channels who are upset about why they have lost viewership. As I have said always, they must evaluate why they have lost viewership. It’s not my concern what they do. If they make false accusations against us, then we are going to respond to those.

I haven't any difficulty having this SeroVital. My skin is tighten and soft, my eyes are shiny. I am forty eight many years old and on my menopause with estrogen medication.
On behalf of my family, we would like to thank Best Start Birth Center for the wonderful birthing experience of our baby girl! Having our two previous daughters at a hospital, the birthing center by far empowers moms to have a true birthing experience! I felt empowered by the supportive staff and especially the midwives. They encourage you to listen to your body and to be intuitive. I was able to give birth as i knew what would be best for baby and me. BSBC stands true to its mission, providing choices for mom, “satisfying experiences, and healthy outcomes.”
We were so amazed in comparison to our previous experience in the hospital with my other two daughters; it was so stressful with minimal options. Perhaps the beeping of machines, the constant offer of meds like the epidural, and all the IV connections doesn’t create a very relaxing environment. Not to mention, mom is required to give birth in a position that is not a liability to the doctor….I’m sorry, but I thought mom is the one who’s having the baby not the doctor. Dad was not even allowed to videotape once our daughters were out of the womb. It doesn’t make sense.
At BSBC, it’s all about mom, the baby and the family the minute you walk in. The staff ensures that you’re educated and prepared for the great day. From classes, to group sessions, to one on one with the midwife, you’re coached throughout your pregnancy. You feel mentally and physically ready to give birth because you have this great team supporting you throughout your journey. From the front desk, to the nurses, to the midwives, everyone is baking you up and treating you with gentle hands. It was the best experience ever! We had the dream team, Shari and Elizabeth, help us with our delivery; they were amazing! I found myself even laughing in between my contractions. They coached us and even encouraged my husband to get involved with the delivery. He’s still amazed that he was able to touch the umbilical cord while it was still pulsating!
Thank you BSBC for making our delivery a monumental experience! To put it in short words, having a baby at BSBC is like a first date; there’s anticipation but BSBC helped set up the right environment with candles, relaxing aromas, calm music and soothing touches; they help prepare you for the big day and ease your nerves to meet your new love one 🙂 We thank you BSBC staff!
For uncomplicated pregnancies, they offer an alternative to the typically expensive and intervention-heavy maternity care system.

Catechism for Dismantling and Eradicating the Scourge of Corruption Embedded in the Judiciary Systems of Sub-Saharan Africa's Nation States
Judicial corruption is the "queen mother" and the most sordid of all corrupt behavior inflicted on the good people of Africa. The tentacles of corruption in the judiciary branch of most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa run far, wide, and deep. African judges must no longer ignore their constitutional obligations to the populace they serve, which often comes with perilous consequences. The citizenry of Sub-Saharan Africa's nation states are entitled to and deserve at a minimum, the same internationally recognized standards of honor, decency and reliability in their dealings with their judiciaries.
Judicial corruption may be defined as acts or omissions that constitute the use of public authority for the private benefit of judges, court personnel, and other justice sector personnel that result in the improper and unfair delivery of judicial decisions. Such acts include bribery, theft of public funds, extortion, intimidation, influence pedaling, the abuse of court procedures for personal gain, and any inappropriate influence on the impartiality of the judicial process by an actor within the court system.
Africa is widely considered amongst the world's most corrupt places, a factor contributing to the stunted development and economic impoverishment of many African nations. Of the ten countries considered to be the most corrupt in the world, six are in sub-Saharan Africa, according to Transparency International (TI), a leading global watchdog on corruption. A 2002 African Union study estimated that corruption costs the continent roughly $150 billion a year. The United States has attempted to discourage corruption in Africa via aid tied to performance predicated on a series of governance indicators through a program administered by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC).
A competent and incorruptible judiciary with fidelity to the vision of equal justice for all is the bedrock on which democracy and democratic practice are anchored. Corruption is pernicious by its very nature so that dishonorable conduct in their judiciary undermine and sap the confidence of the African people in the judiciary, which in turn, steers this most important bastion of democracy into a tailspin of self-destruction. Stated another way, the most important destructive force that can infect a state and militate against respect for the rule of law is judicial corruption. It is clearly a cancer in Africa's nation-states that desecrates the principle of the rule of law and systematically destroys the fabric of decent society and good governance.
Last month, the world celebrated International Women's Day. For many, this date was an opportunity to welcome the progress made in decades to collectively help women realize their limitless potential to contribute to economic development the world over. It was also a date to continue our thinking on policies to improve gender equality. Though International Women's Day is over, the spirit of the celebration must carry on for the rest of the year and going forward. Around the world, women continue to record political successes. Ten years have passed since Ellen Johnson Sirleaf became the first elected female head of state in Africa after a lifetime of groundbreaking efforts to promote gender equality. Several other countries in traditionally male societies have since elected female presidents as well. An increased number of constitutional reforms underscores other successes across the globe,
With the demise of the Doha Development Round at the World Trade Organization Ministerial in Nairobi this past December, the multilateral approach to global trade negotiations has largely ended. Given that the number of regional trade agreements has increased from 70 in 1990 to more than 270 today, it appears that it is every region for itself when it comes to global trade.
The Tripartite Free Trade Agreement (TFTA), signed in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt in June 2015, brings the Common Market of Eastern and South Africa (COMESA), the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern Africa development Community (SADC) into the continent's largest free-trade zone covering 26 countries and stretching from Cape Town to Cairo.
In the aftermath of the #PanamaLeaks --and in the lead-up to the Anti-Corruption Summit in London on May 12th--attention has turned to the work of the AU-ECA High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa (HLP) as well as ECA's recent Africa Governance Report IV on Measuring Corruption in Africa. Highlighting those reports, the video below explains the need to rethink how many perception-based indexes measure corruption in Africa. Especially in light of ample evidence that the operations of foreign players on the continent and tax havens in other countries are causing significant illicit financial outflows, the omissions of which present serious gaps in current measurements. More about ECA in this BRIEFING.
In an interview with Clive Myrie, Nigeria's President Buhari has agreed with Prime Minister David Cameron's comments about corruption in Nigeria.
The 10th Parliament will kick-off on a collision course with the Executive after President Museveni rejected a Bill that sought to exempt MPs' transport allowances from taxes, triggering an instant backlash from furious lawmakers.
Africa has the world's youngest and fastest-growing population. Today, the continent is home to more than 200 million people between the ages of 15 and 24, and its young population is increasingly well-educated. On current trends, nearly 60% of 20-24 year-olds in Africa will have a secondary education in 2030, according to the World Bank.
This growing cohort of young, skilled people is reflected in a wave of entrepreneurship that is transforming economies across Africa.
Zimbabwe clamped down with the enforcement of its controversial indigenization law-requiring foreign companies with assets of more than $500,000 to transfer or sell a 51 percent stake to indigenous Zimbabweans this month. The deadline of April 1 had been set earlier in March in accordance with the controversial 2008 indigenization law requiring foreign companies to submit plans for such indigenization or face the risk of closure. Zimbabwe is serious: According to the minister of youth and indigenization and economic empowerment, Patrick Zhuwao, the government is determined to implement the policy because it was elected in 2013 through "promised indigenization and empowerment." As Zimbabwe's largest source of foreign investment, Chinese investors are inevitably impacted. While China has generally tried to dispel the image of the indigenization being targeted at China, it has clearly voiced its displeasure, especially in the case of the diamond mining industry. Furthermore, dissatisfaction is rampant among many in China, who question the solidity and future of the special friendship between the two countries.
Mozambique, over the last two decades, has experienced explosive growth, with an average GDP growth rate of almost 8 percent between 1997-2015. Not only that, but, for the most part, Mozambique has a track record of solid macroeconomic policies, like controlling inflation, reducing current account deficit, and lowering the country's dependence on aid. Like many other sub-Saharan African countries, though, the rapid growth rate has not transformed into substantially decreasing poverty rates. Indeed, while Mozambique's poverty rates fell dramatically from 1997-2003, many experts attribute that trend to post-war recovery from the civil war that ended in 1992, no clear progress seems to have been made from 2003-09.

The director of the original Tank Girl movie is in negotiations to reacquire the rights to make a new adaptation of the anarchic comic strip...
Tank Girl director Rachel Talalay has been in talks with Sony about re-optioning the rights to make a new movie about the anarchic post-apocalyptic comic-strip character.
"I've been talking to the studio about re-optioning [Tank Girl] recently." said Talalay in an interview with Den Of Geek yesterday. "I went in and had a conversation with them, because in order to re-option it I had to make sure they didn't want to do it themselves. There's nobody there who was there from the original days, obviously..."
Talalay's 1995 adaptation of the cult 80s/90s UK comic, though not a commercial success, has gained a cult following, often dividing Tank GIrl fans between the comic purists who deride the film as a compromise on the wise-cracking, tank-driving desert-dweller, and the film's own legions of fans, won over by Lori Petty's eccentric lead and the film's sense of fun.
The making of Tank Girl was a legendarily bitter struggle between Talalay and MGM/UA in 1994. Sci-fi friendly producer Alan Ladd (Star Wars, Alien) had green-lit the movie prior to his 1993 departure from the company and his successors proved hostile to the project. Asked if she was really willing to go through the process of making Tank Girl again, Talalay said: "Only if I could have an option, rather than having to go through it all again with them."
"What I don't want is for them to say 'Yes, we do want it', I want them to say 'Yes, go ahead and option it and do it the way you feel you weren't able to do it the first time. Everything has moved on, everything is different now and we can talk about doing it again..."
Talalay mentioned during the interview that she would eschew the various casting suggestions doing the internet rounds and 'Go younger' for the principal role, casting an actress in her late teens.
Though the studio is willing to grant Talalay the option to Tank Girl and has no other plans to develop a new Tank Girl project, the acquisition of the rights is proving problematic due to legal issues of propriety related to MGM/UA's acquisition by Sony.

Yield Protection is a multiple peril crop insurance product that provides protection against a loss in yield due to nearly all natural disasters. For most crops, that includes drought, excess moisture, cold and frost, wind, flood, and unavoidable damage from insects and disease. This product guarantees a yield based on an individual producer's actual production history. If the production to count is less than the yield guarantee, the insured is paid a loss.
• Yield Protection price is established by using 100% of the average closing price of the December Futures Contract of the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) during the month of February for corn. For soybeans, it is 100% of the average closing price for November Futures Contract on the CBOT during the month of February.

On Saturdays and sometimes after school, children may also sign up for professional training in one or more fields: mental maths (UCMAS), languages (Spoken English and French using a BBC London Programme), a range of activities such as sports, horse-riding, instrumental and vocal music, dancing, arts and crafts, swimming, martial arts, gymnastics, calligraphy, photography, etc., with talented staff and professional coaches, or with the help of technology. Other options will be added through time.
Also Parents Speak and Kidzeyes they are kind of together are GREAT. Kidzeyes is for kids ages 6 and up and my daughter loves taking her surveys she gets 2 to 3 a month and they make money very fast usually 1 to 3 dollars per survey and then they get their very own check in the mail. We LOVE it! It’s usually about an ad or a new two we have done commercial watching , kid food package designs a lot of fun she made $33 dollars in her first year. She was thrilled
After joining a survey site, you provide some personal and demographic information, which legitimate survey sites will keep private. That information will be used in choosing participants to take surveys on certain goods and services. If you get selected to take part in a survey, you will be notified through mail to take a short survey to see if your profile suits that survey. When you are deemed qualified, you will be requested to take a longer survey.
You can expect to earn $2-$5 for most of the surveys in general. For some special surveys you can earn up to $50 per survey but those are rare. Harris Poll also conducts paid focus group studies where you can earn $50-$100 per study. Usually these focus group studies are 1-2 hours long where you interact with other participants under a supervision of a focus group moderator.
The biggest draw of taking online surveys is that you can take these surveys whenever it’s convenient to you. You decide when and where you take these surveys. All you need is a laptop or mobile device that can connect to the Internet. So relax and take some surveys while enjoying your favourite café or in front of the tv when the kids are asleep, it’s up to you! And best of all - you’ll get paid for it.
You're unlikely to "get rich quick" by taking paid online surveys. You will, however, likely earn or win some extra spending money, or free or discounted goods or services. Doing paid online surveys can be seen as a way to get a fairly steady flow of a decent amount of cash coming in each month. If you enjoy participating in online surveys (especially if you enjoy sharing your opinion for prizes, coupons, and other more typical non-monetary earnings), then paid online surveys is a good choice for you.
All this website is great but one site which is not mention here is univoxcommunity.com. i am attached with this site from last 2 years and i have earned many points and 2 Amazon gift card. got amazon gift card , which operates across the world and gives you access to millions of products!. and they are very friendly with panelists. i love this website which always ready to help in any trouble. so for me this is my favorite site for earning money.
With one of the lowest cash limits in the industry, you can get $10 out when you have accrued just 100 points. If you want to take your earnings in the form of a giftcard, the threshold is even lower, as you just need 50 points, equivalent to $5. Many other survey sites will only pay out after you earn much more, like $50. As with all good survey sites, Opinion Outpost allows you to take your earnings away in vouchers for big firms like Amazon or iTunes, or if you prefer money, to do so through Paypal. As well as paying out early Opinion Outpost also pays extremely quickly, often the same day or in some cases, immediately.
Scammers use a diverse variety of methods to allure and dupe unsuspecting victims. Some ads and offers look so real that even the most seasoned internet veterans can be tricked. However, many scams target people new to the market who may be more susceptible to “get rich quick” schemes because they're unaware of what you can reasonably make taking surveys. It is incredibly uncommon to be offered more than $10 to complete a 20 minute survey. Not that one offering that or more is definitely a scam, it's just important to be cautious. While some experienced and well credited survey takers receive legitimate offers paying that pay big money, if you're new to survey taking you should definitely steer clear of anyone offering you hundreds to complete a survey.
My favorites are my survey and my points. Time consuming yes but if you can some how multitask the work a bit. I use to like doing them while sitting next to the hubby while he was watching his favorite sci-fi shows. Or if I was having a energy low in the afternoon I would put my feet up and do a few surveys. I still do the click thru emails for my points but have stopped doing survey’s this year due to being in a different season of life right now than I once was.

After you have registered, we invite you to take part in online surveys by email. In the invitation email you will find a link to the questionnaire along with a brief description of the survey topic. The survey begins as soon as you click on the link: you will be asked questions that you can then answer by simply clicking on an option or entering text.
I have tosay that by joining the survey sites that you haveon your list i have madeover 300.00in the last 6 months doing surveys and watching videos so if you have the timetospend doingsurveys you wont makea whole lot of money but you will enjoy the survey opportunititys and every little bit will add up if you join all of these except panda research which is known for sending your money to someone elsed paypal account because it happened to me about 2 years ago andthey took 186.00 from me.
If you're looking to make money by completing surveys online – this site will not be very helpful for you. Like the previous sites, they will take, retain, and sell your information to anyone that waves a dollar in their faces. UNLIKE previous sites reviewed, they hide their consent for that information. It's buried. So not only do you make silly reward points that don't translate to cash but every third party service and product solicitor has your personal information.
Opinion Outpost is one I have been doing for the last 7 years (SEVEN! I had to look back through to see how long it was) I have made 260 dollars in that time (roughly 37 dollars a year). I like them because I seem to qualify for a lot of them, (I think I have made a lot of that money this last year) you can cash out at every ten dollars (into your paypal account) the pitfalls they send quite a few emails between 1-5 a day and if you don’t qualify you only get a sweeps entry and in 7 years I have never won anything. it just seems so easy to cash out .
I have joined many survey site from all this site, and they are good but they take time for payment. one of the most amazing online survey site is missing here which i have joined last year and earn many point, this site pay at a weekly cycle and pay maximum point for every survey. . I have earned many points and Tango Card which is a very special gift card. Value on a Tango Card can be redeemed for other popular gift cards, donations and local business options – all without any fees or expiration dates. Its called surveycurrency.com.
They claim to also offer paid product testing opportunities. But it’s not really paid product testing, but more of getting cash back. Basically, besides surveys, you can purchase products and services through their portal and earn a certain amount of cash back for every dollar you spend. If you were going to buy something already, it’s a great way to get some of the cash back. But don’t just buy something because of the cashback.
Survey Junkie makes it quick and easy to jump into the survey game. According to their websites, they say they are the “most popular spot online to earn cash and rewards for sharing your thoughts,” while that might not be technically true, they are one of the largest survey sites out there. They were launched all the way back in 2005 (which is pretty old for a survey site) and they have over 4,000,000 members.

Yes, you read that correctly, these guys had two wedding days, and I shall explain. But before we go any further, I’m going to get something out of the way, and mention this once and once only: it rained. It rained a lot. On both days. In August. It was torrential on both days. Torrential rain on two days in August. I mean, what are the chances? I know no-one pictures rain on their wedding day, let alone twice, so it was incredibly bad weather luck. But Charlotta and Mitesh were superstars, and that will be the last mention of the weather, as I now tell you how amazing their two days were:
Their first day was back at the beginning of August at Bhaktivedanta Manor, a well-known Hare Krishna temple near Watford. The temple itself is a beaut tudor-style building which was famously donated by George Harrison back in the day, and a great location for Charlotta and Mitesh’s traditional Hindu ceremony. As we gathered for the ceremony, it became clear that the groom and his entourage of gents were running a little late for the ceremony, as they were stuck in a little traffic on the M25. Fast forward around two hours, and Mitesh scampered into the temple to get changed (!) and the ceremony was soon underway, incorporating all the traditional elements including the 12 rituals and a final blessing. I loved seeing the intricacies of the ceremony and, as it was my first one, I felt a learnt a little something! (Don’t worry I was taking photos too.)
Once Charlotta and Mitesh had received their final blessing, we took a few moments out in the gardens to steal a few photographs as the early evening darkness descended. You can check out a selection of the photographs from that day below – but do continue to read on to the end of the page, as I’ll show you their second wedding day at Marks Hall in Coggeshall! ⇣
For their second wedding celebration, Charlotta and Mitesh chose lovely Essex barn wedding venue The Coach House at Marks Hall, in Coggeshall just between Braintree and Colchester. They’d chosen the Sunday of the late August bank holiday weekend for this day, and this was to be my fourth wedding in four days – a typically busy summer of weddings – but I’ll talk more about that later. I was looking forward to rounding off my epic 4 weddings in 4 days with this beauty.
In the morning I headed to photograph Charlotta and her gang getting ready a few miles up the road, whilst Mitesh took no chances of getting stuck in traffic this time, and he and the gents got ready at Marks Hall 🙂
They’d initially planned an outdoor ceremony, which the venue is famous for, but we all got a little friendlier with our neighbours by getting cosy under the canopy/marquee just off Marks Hall’s barn to await the bride. It’s fair to say it was a bit of a squeeze, but it was totally worth the friendly ambience as Mitesh looked uncharacteristically nervous waiting for Charlotta to arrive, and in her inimitable style, she thought it was absolutely hilarious as she headed up the aisle to meet him. I loved it!!
Once the ceremony was concluded, with some great readings, guests headed into the barn for some drinks and nibbles, and the new(ish) Mr and Mrs gallantly stayed with me to fly through some group photos as we were still held under cover. Three Mile Hill provided the brilliant music throughout, and soon it was time for the speeches.
There were 5 speeches in total, but each being totally unique and an exceptional way to kick off the celebrations into the evening, and expertly compered by the groom’s cousin Amar. Charlotta’s Dad provided a memorable, highly amusing speech which did wander down a few different tangents but it was brilliant all the same; Mitesh’s brother Mehul took his opportunity to get his own back with his speech, after Mitesh had (and I quote) “ripped it out of him” when he was Best Man at Mehul’s wedding previously. Mehul cracked everyone up with some good-hearted digs at his brother, which was really well received – well, fingers crossed! After the other two speeches from Charlotta’s brother and Mitesh’s other Best Man Anoop, Mitesh went on to give quite possible one of the best Groom’s speeches I’ve heard in a long while. Interspersing his speech with some questionably-translated Gujarati (you were saying something naughty, I think Mitesh!), along with his East London rapping alter-ego, Mitesh’s speech had just about everything you could want, and I absolutely loved it.
As you’ll remember me saying above, their wedding at Marks Hall was the finale to a 4 in 4 wedding bonanza for me, and by the evening I was feeling, understandably, a little tired. Charlotta and Mitesh had experienced two logistically challenging wedding days, but had gone about them with such humour and energy, and it really was inspiring. Nothing had fazed them, whether it was being stuck on the M25 for two hours or whatever, and they never let their frustrations with logistics show on either day, instead just going with the flow and cracking up with laughter at every opportunity.
When they went onto the dancefloor for their first dance in front of the giant LOVE letters, I braced myself for this year’s usual Ed Sheeran or John Legend ballad, and got my camera ready. As the first few notes of their first dance song started I was pleasantly surprised, as Fleetwood Mac’s ‘Everywhere’ began to play! The upbeat lyrics and tune, combined with seeing the new Mr and Mrs T looking so happy as they let loose on the dancefloor, in addition to the closing moments of my knackering 4 in 4 days, got this photographer a little choked behind the camera. I don’t mind saying that it was totally heartwarming seeing them so happy, out there on the dancefloor accompanied by such a great song, a really emotive sight, and something which has stayed with me since that day – and I have been playing ‘Everywhere’ on repeat since!
Thank you guys, for tolerating me for two weddings (!), and here’s a selection of images from their Marks Hall wedding:

It had been four years since my dad and I have visited Japan. It was a much needed trip to visit family we have not seen in a long time. My aunt and uncle now lived in a new house right on the ocean. We had the chance to set out and go fishing a few times which was really fun. After the days catch we would go back and prep some of the fish for a great dinner.
We mostly stayed in the country side of Itoshima. It was very quite with not much going happening but farming and fishing. The food from this whole area is some of my favorite in the world. Every chance we got we would stop and get some ramen and it is unlike anywhere else in the world. One of the ramen restaurants has been run by the same family since my dad was a child. They remember us being the “american” people coming in to eat every few years.
A few of the days we visited the city of Tenjin to do some shopping and visit some friends. It was nice to see a lot of friendly faces of the city. We got the chance to go to a baseball game which is always a treat. Japanese baseball fans are amazing and unlike anywhere else. This trip reminded me about how much I like Japan, and that I should visit more often.
The Citizens America Party is a Foundational and Educational Site to Shine the Light on The Three Great Hurts That Are Being Played Out on the World: The 9/11 Big Lie, the "War on Terror" and Global Zionism which We Consider Simply Non-Human
"Let us therefore animate and encourage each other, and show the whole world that a Freeman, contending for liberty on his own ground, is superior to any slavish mercenary on earth" – George Washington, 2 July 1776
"The money powers prey upon the nation in times of peace and conspire against it in times of adversity. It is more despotic than a monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, and more selfish than bureaucracy. It denounces as public enemies, all who question its methods or throw light upon its crimes. I have two great enemies, the Southern Army in front of me and the Bankers in the rear. Of the two, the one at my rear is my greatest foe...corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money powers of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in the hands of a few, and the Republic is destroyed” – Abraham Lincoln
"I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. Already they have raised up a monied aristocracy that has set the government at defiance. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs" –Thomas Jefferson
"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered"– Thomas Jefferson
“You [(International Trans-Atlantic Bankers)] are a den of vipers and thieves. I intend to rout you out, and by the Eternal god, I will rout you out. If the American people only understood the rank injustice of our money and banking system, there would be a revolution before the morning.” – Andrew Jackson, the seventh President of the United States of America
"History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and its issuance." – James Madison
"The high office of President has been used to foment a plot to destroy the American's freedom, and before I leave office I must inform the citizen of his plight." – John F. Kennedy, speaking at Columbia University, 10 days before his assassination
Please note – Osama Bin Laden died a long time ago, we believe from kidney failure. He said that he was not involved in 9/11. The ongoing surfacing of Bin Laden tapes are simply the creation of intelligence agencies who are carrying on the whole facade of terror and war in the world.
Just as Mossad has been tied to the "underwear bomber" – Al-Qaeda or "Al-CIA-duh" is a creation of the CIA which is the reason Ron Paul has said we need to "take out" the CIA instead.
The intelligence agencies are manufacturing terrorism to turn the country over to full fledged fascism (911 was planned for the treasonous "patriot act") – so don't accept any laws that take away any one's rights no matter what you hear in "the news" including the nonsense about the "underwear bomber" that are to forfeit more rights.
If you hear about terrorism in "the news" it's been CIA created, literally, and the "news" people who push the terrorism stories know it. They are part of the machinery to bring fascism, racism and the "police state" into the country. And yes, Glenn Beck and the whole Fox follies (highly paid oppositional tools and vassals that attempt to sabotage and confuse the Whole Truth) are part of it because they push the "Muslims done it" stories which are totally false. You can tell who's real and who's not including CNN in the news business or anywhere else for that matter simply by this fact alone.
Check it against Abraham Lincoln's quote above: "The money power works on the prejudices of the people"
Also, not only can Big Media lie, they can also "elide" – which means "to eliminate or leave out of consideration" which they do all the time. 9/11 Truth is a subject that they elide. The subject of war crimes of US officials is also what they elide as well as the truth about vaccines, particularly the current H1N1. These are just a small number of critical subjects needed for public scrutiny in fixing all the national ills.
Also, the truth about Israel and the treasonous system within America's governing structure is a Biggie. Traitors must be separated out from the Patriots if the nation is to survive. War is Zionism. Militarism is Zionism. The Denial of Any Rights to Anyone is Zionism. Income Taxes – a Product of Usury of the Central Bankers is Zionism. The Security State (not the Free State) is Zionism. And the give away to even a closet Zionist in the American government is the "support of Israel" which is nothing but a racist and oppressive state and a total leach on America where the parasite has now consumed the host.
Zionism lies. Zionism deceives. Zionism also elides. Its power is vacuous brute power and therefore has no depth, reason, rationality or good to its actions which is why it must deceive and sloganeer to win. Zionism attacks truth through labels like "thugs" and "terrorists" – and conspires to take away justice and rights of all Human Beings.
So important to know for the life of the nation, for an injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere as Martin Luther King said.
Also, why haven't Big Media told you about Israel making Gaza into the world's largest concentration camp. Are the Israelis not diminishing the Holocaust themselves?
With the reality of the "elide" there is no such thing then as "Fair and Balanced" or "We Let You Decide" because We, The People are not given the whole picture or the whole truth.
"IF those five members of the US Supreme Court are not arrested, tried and shot for high-treason against the United States and its constitution; then the new owners will leave everything as it is and pretend that nothing has changed. Yet everything has changed from credit-card charges to ownership of your supposed home or property: From what you're allowed to keep by way of what you supposedly earn to what you will be allowed to buy. And everything will be subject to immediate change without any challenge from those directly affected by these "NEW RULES."
"All of this goes way beyond the nightmare described in Orwell's "1984" because in effect there are now 'NO RULES' for those in power and millions of rules for the chattel that we shall all become under this new system that bears no resemblance to what was envisioned under the US Constitution. "We" are no longer citizens in a country because we have just become expendable property of a group of faceless corporations whose only interest is their own bottom-line-regardless of the cost in human life, in property or in long term damage to the human race."
The real fantasy in this long-running geopolitical fraud lies in why U.S. lawmakers continue to befriend and defend a “nation” that has for so long—and so consistently—deceived and betrayed its most loyal ally. As a badly miscast Eva Marie Saint asked in her most memorable line in Exodus: “When will it ever end?”
The greatest wonder will be if, based on facts confirming the depth and duration of this duplicity, those lawmakers urging continued support for Israel are not charged with treason. [See: How the Israel Lobby Took Control of U.S. Foreign Policy.]
To restore its national security, the U.S. must shake off its entangled alliance with this extremist enclave. “Shaking off” is the literal translation of “intifada.” Those who know the true facts behind this trans-generational deception are quickly reaching the conclusion that the recognition of this enclave as a legitimate state was key to this ongoing fraud. Others may be waiting for the movie, American Intifada.
"The ever exploding twin towers of US debt and trade deficits are to be expected from a country that's engaged in two foreign invasions, maintains over 170 military bases overseas, gives trillions of dollars to foreign bankers, yet produces nothing anyone in the world wants or can use.
"With corruption, graft, fraud, deception, ignorance, and mismanagement, political regime after political regime has finally collapsed the US economy, and our middle-class along with it, all by the careful design of the International Monetary/Banking Cartel.
"Soon, we'll be hearing of the glories of "Recapitalization" from the chattering-class of Cartel mouth-pieces, those who perform on television as talking-heads, that pretend to analyze the day's news.
"Long story cut short, Recapitalization is being conducted by those who destroyed our economy, the International Monetary/Banking Cartel, by buying up our nation's natural resources, our water, and our infrastructure, with about 10 cents on a very inflated dollar. We are giving the Cartel the very rope with which to hang us from a tree on property we used to own. Yes, now that the Cartel has bankrupted America, with the help of their many stooges in government, their current governmental underlings are selling off America to the very same Cartel that has bankrupted us all. ...
"Ultimately, Mr. Obama, his top-level appointees, practically every member of congress, and the entire Supreme Court are all governmental lackeys of the International Monetary/Banking Cartel."
"Understanding this in-our-face attempt to disrupt and dismantle our system of government helps to explain why the President and the Democrat leadership turn an increasingly deaf ear to the complaints of the voters. Those complaints, according to their scheme, will soon be rendered moot, mere background noise. They know our best, most immediate course of action against the Obamacrats attempted coup is to "throw the bums out" in November. But if the biggest and baddest of the bums can pull off their power play, our voting a new team onto the political field in Washington will have little impact on changing the outcome of the liberals' endgame.
"The alarming evidence of the Administration's purposeful attempt to pry more and more authority from the Congress is stark and overwhelming. The arguments demonstrating the President's plan to amass and consolidate government power under his far-reaching control are clear and compelling. The Congress — the most direct reach of the people into the Washington political machine — is being systematically neutered. Nullification of this once-great legislative body is fully underway."
"History will record how a gutless, wantonly corrupt Congress and immoral leadership in the White House killed a great nation that strayed from its lofty ideals. ...
"There is only one hope for America and that is to clean out Washington, DC wall-to-wall, every office, and get some people in there to clean up the damned mess these RNC, DNC and bureaucratic morons have made of America.
"AIPAC, out!, Lobbyists of every sort, fashion and special interest, out! The nitwits the pollute every level of our government and the policy making machinery, out!
"We have devolved from being the shining light of freedom, liberty and democracy to the laughing stock of the world."
The Citizens America Party Platform is the Required Check on the Checks and Balances of the Constitutional Form of Government – its very way institutes vigilance to ensure liberty:
"But you must remember, my fellow-citizens, that eternal vigilance by the people is the price of liberty, and that you must pay the price if you wish to secure the blessing. It behooves you, therefore, to be watchful in your States as well as in the Federal Government." – Andrew Jackson, Farewell Address, March 4, 1837
"Nine years ago, the Cheney/Bush/Rove/Rumsfeld administration started, by a series of treasonous lies, its so-called endless wars on the nebulous "terrorism", much of which was provoked by decades of anti-Muslim/pro-Israeli US foreign policies. According to the US Department of Defense more US military personnel have taken their own lives since 2001 than have been killed in action (KIA) in either Iraq or Afghanistan. In 2009 alone, more than 330 active servicemen and women have committed suicide - more than those KIAs in Afghanistan and Iraq. And this number doesn't count the veterans who have killed themselves following their discharge. ...
"How crazy-making must it be for physically and spiritually-wounded veterans, who thought that they were defending their country, being willing to die for democracy, and then finding out too late that they had actually been fighting and killing and dying for thousands of corporate war profiteers like Halliburton, Gulf Oil, Blackwater, the big financial institutions, the weapons-makers, the gun-runners and the reflected glory for ChickenHawk politicians and talking heads like Cheney, Bush, Rumsfeld, Rice, Ashcroft, Wolfowitz, Rove, Limbaugh, Hannity and numberless others who never experienced the horrors of war themselves?"
Off-resonance errors due to magnetic field inhomogeneity are a major challenge for amide proton transfer imaging. Two-pool Bloch equation simulations were used to optimize the timing for pulsed APT imaging with two different subtraction methods. Simulations indicate that the pulse width and interpulse delay as well as the subtraction method used are key factors in optimizing APT for insensitivity to magnetic field inhomogeneity.

Time and again, movie directors or music producers try to capitalize on a successful recipe. Sequels are often just recooked originals that don’t bring much new to a particular story or situation.
Not so in this case, as we focus upon New Testament references to communal meals and eating and drinking, both literally and metaphorically. While some of the themes will already be familiar from the first table talk article,1 in which we dealt with some of the Old Testament communal meals, I hope that you can see new vistas and hear new melodies that—while familiar—add new depth and meaning.
I would guess that the most notable meal in Scripture, the one that challenges theologians to keep on writing, musicians to keep making music, or artists to capture the moment on canvas, must surely be the last meal of Jesus prior to His crucifixion. We know it as the Last Supper and continue to be intrigued by its significance and profound theological ramifications.
Actually, it was a fairly simple and definitely a traditional meal, prepared on the eve of the Passover festival that Jesus shared with His disciples that evening. According to Luke’s description of this significant event, Peter and John were sent ahead to prepare the Passover meal (Luke 22:8). Obeying Jesus’ instructions, they set out and find the place just as Jesus had told them. They secure the room and prepare another Passover meal for the small band of Jesus’ disciples—this will be their third with Jesus.
Jews from all over the ancient world traveled for the Passover festival to Jerusalem. It was one of the key elements defining the Jewish experience and remembering God’s mighty deliverance and protection during the Exodus. During the Exodus, the painting of blood upon the doorframe marked the particular house as one where God’s Word was highly regarded. The eating of the roasted lamb and the bitter herbs by the entire household (or a number of neighboring households [Ex. 12:3, 4]) underlined the importance of community in worship and salvation. All this provided the mental and religious backdrop for this significant moment and—consciously or subconsciously—were in the minds of those celebrating the moment when God’s angel had truly passed over.
Of the four Gospel accounts only John’s describes in detail the foot-washing that precedes the Passover meal (John 13:1-11), introducing an important theological element. Service for one another is to be a natural result of God’s ultimate service for His creation. As Jesus shares the elements of the Passover meal, He applies them to Himself and already points to the glorious day of sharing a meal in the kingdom (Matt. 26:29). He is “doing theology,” and we wonder how much the disciples understood at that particular moment. As Luke tells us, they were so busy discussing who would be the greatest (Luke 22:24) that they seemed to have missed both the object lesson (of washing the feet) as well as the reinterpretation of the Passover meal elements to the sacrifice and offering of Jesus Himself.
Later, following the resurrection of Jesus and the powerful outpouring of the Holy Spirit, the table fellowship involving the practical breaking of bread or eating together becomes a key marker of the new movement (Acts 2:42-47). In fact, at the end of the trip from Jerusalem to Emmaus, Cleopas and his friend suddenly recognize Jesus when He breaks the bread before their eyes (Luke 24:30-32). This bread-breaking and sharing the cup was the final confirmation that helped them to recognize Jesus. It suddenly made the events of their journey with Jesus “click” in their minds.
Eating together was only one of the key practices of the early church as believers remembered Jesus’ sacrifice and understood ever more of its meaning for their life and fellowship. These meals could also cause division and tensions—particularly in the context of Jewish purity concerns. Paul describes one of the more problematic meals in his Epistle to the Galatians. Peter, after having experienced and understood the disturbing vision described in Acts 10:9-16, travels to Antioch, the most important city in Roman Syria and the third-largest city of the empire. As he ministers in this international metropolis to Jews, Jewish Christians, and Gentile converts, he eats with all of these groups. At this point it is important to remember a vital element of communal meals that is present in all eastern cultures (including also the Old Testament period): eating and drinking together unites people in purpose and establishes a bond that is stronger than many modern contracts.
In response to the arrival of some Jewish Christians from Jerusalem, Peter separated himself from the Gentile Christians. Galatians 2:12 tells us that he was afraid to fall foul of the newly arrived Jewish Christians who—apparently—belonged to a faction that regarded most (if not all) of the Old Testament purity laws (including circumcision) as a prerequisite of being a true follower of the Messiah. By not continuing to share meals with Gentiles and uncircumcised Gentile Christians, Peter was making a loud and definite theological statement regarding an issue that nearly split the early church (cf. Acts 15).
Paul, not one to mince his words, confronted Peter publicly about his double standards (Gal. 2:14). I don’t know if we can grasp the implications of this public affront. To be shamed publicly was the last resort in conflict, and highlights the importance that Paul attached to it. Acting with integrity was more crucial than table fellowship, as the following verses of Galatians 2 make clear.
The direct link between table fellowship and theology is easy to see and again underlines the importance of shared meals. Simply imagine if Paul had kept silent in that crucial moment of Christian history. While we don’t pay much attention to who is eating with whom these days, some of the issues Peter and Paul faced around the table involving inclusiveness, community stretching beyond race and ethnicity, and the basis of our salvation are still hot topics in Adventist theology.
Up to this point most of the references to table fellowship have been literal. However, the New Testament (as well as the Old Testament) also uses the eating/drinking activity as metaphors or symbols pointing to something beyond the reality of this planet.2 Metaphors are important tools of the trade when written texts are concerned. Metaphors are often ambiguous, making it more difficult to interpret them. We cannot always link a metaphor to one particular meaning. Understanding metaphors requires a knowledge of the values and concerns of a particular culture, but the good news is that metaphors are able to transcend time (as, for example, in the case of the Old and New Testament periods).
The book of Revelation contains dozens of references to eating and drinking—mostly in a metaphorical sense. Revelation 2:7 promises food from the tree of life to those who “overcome” from the church of Ephesus, which links it to the first three chapters of Genesis. Revelation 2:14, 20 reprimands those who eat food dedicated to idols. Looking at the specific context, it seems that this “eating” is not referring to the physical process of food intake but rather points in metaphoric language to spiritual prostitution.3
Revelation 17:6 is another example of eating and drinking used as a metaphor, and in this context points to judgment. The harlot is “drunk with the blood of the saints” and is about to be judged. Revelation 19:18 also uses the metaphor in the context of judgment—this time judgment hits the beast and its supporters, who are eaten by the birds of the sky. This echoes Old Testament references to complete destruction, as, for example, in the prophecy denouncing the descendants of Jeroboam (1 Kings 14:11) that was repeated more specifically in 1 Kings 16:4 and 21:24.
However, table talk in Revelation isn’t used exclusively to describe the completeness of the final judgment. It’s also used to describe the complete opposite—that is, final victory and salvation. This final victory is linked to banquets and meals and free food (Rev. 7:16; 11:5; 12:6, 14; 19:9; 21:6; and 22:17). The one who overcomes will dine with Jesus, who has been knocking on the door (Rev. 3:20). It is good to remember that this is not a potluck or fellowship lunch. Jesus Himself provides the bountiful food and drink and then sits to enjoy a meal with us—His redeemed. The ultimate banquet is by invitation only (Rev. 19:9) and is a fitting link to Eden, where eating demonstrated loyalties. This wedding feast is an echo of the Last Supper, but this time Jesus, the victorious Lamb of God, is sitting on the throne. No more hunger. No more thirst. No more doubts about the character of God. This feast is part of the culmination of the cosmic controversy.
As I think about the importance of table talk in the New Testament I recognize once again the power of sharing food, discovering community, working through challenging issues, and celebrating the greatest moment in this planet’s history. On that day Jesus willfinally return to bring home His children—those who trusted in His salvation (and not their own), those who heard the knock on their door and responded joyfully, those who recognized that divine grace—His grace—is sufficient. I am looking forward to sitting with Jesus around this festive table. Have you already booked your seat around that table?

"If hili the orchestra wanted a fast tempo, and the other half wanted it slow," Eriko Sato, a violinist, recalls, "we would play in the middle." It was a bit like the world of "La Bohème"- high-spirited, spontaneous, and precanous. From the outset, Orpheus attracted some of the most talented, and intrepid, young classical musicians in New York. By 1978, when the group gave its first Carnegie Hall concert, it was playing with such leading young American solo- ists as the pianists Emanuel Ax and Pe- ter Serkin. In 1984, Orpheus was signed by Deutsche Grammophon to record the entire range of the chamber-orchestra repertory. It joined such attractions on the German label as Herbert von Kara- jan, the Vienna Philharmonic, Leonard Bernstein, and Maurizio Pollini-ex- traordinary recognition for an American group. Orpheus was no longer a novelty; it was a world-class orchestra. Now its members faced the challenge of adapting to this new status without endangering its founding principles. The first new deci- sion was to elect a concertmaster for each piece, but when this proved to be conten- tious and cumbersome the task of choos- ing concertmasters was turned over to an executive committee of musicians. Nev- ertheless, the system was still too all-out democratic to be musically efficient. "Many of us were really frustrated with the slow pace of interpretative evolution . in the rehearsal process," Fifer recalls. Consequently, Orpheus developed a system it calls "the core," in which the executive committee chooses a concertmaster, and each instrumental section a representative, for every piece; this group works through questions of interpretation and phrasing before the orchestra's first full rehearsal. Orpheus thus passed from the primitive stage of pure democracy to a representa- tive form of government. Predictably, this caused unease, and only within the past three or four years has the core become a routine element of the Orpheus system. Even so, Eric Bartlett, a cellist, says, "There's a constant reciprocating motion back and forth: Why hasn't this decision already been made? What has the core been doing? Did you have a core?' " This, Bartlett says, is often followed by "So, everything's decided. We don't get to have any input here-what, we just show up for work?" Such, of course, are the stresses of representative democracy. I FIRST caught up wIth Orpheus when the players were beginning to re- hearse for a Carnegie Hall concert this past May The rehearsal was held at Riv- erside Church, the splendid Gothic pile near Columbia University, where Fifer and the rest of the Orpheus office staff are quartered. At 10:15 A.M., the musi- cians began drifting in, toting their in- struments. Most were in jeans; a few were carrying a snack in a child's 1unchbox. Only about hili of the orchestra's twenty- six musicians were present, since this was the core that had been selected for a hell- isWy difficult piece entitled "Trans," an Orpheus commission from a Boston- based composer named Lee Hy1a. After much scraping of chairs, the musicians arranged themselves on the stage in a crescent, at the center of which was a dis- tinctive blank space-the space where a conductor would normally stand. Instead of looking front and center, the musicians looked to the co-concertmasters, Eric Bartlett and Mitchell Stem, a violinist. On a signal from Stem, the strings sawed away frantically for a few measures, which was all it took for them to scramble the tem- po. Stern shouted, "Stop, stop, stop!" and the rehearsal dissolved into general con- versation, as Orpheus rehearsals often do The players questioned one another on technical points. "Is it two-four or one- two?" asked Frank Morelli, a bassoonist, adding, "I forgot my slide rule." The gen- eral feeling was that "Trans" should be played by mathematical, rather than mu- sical, instruments. One wind player said . all " I 1 . I , 1 1 " sarcastIc y, love It. t s so . .. ove y. Bartlett observed solemnly, "It's one of those flailing, visual pieces." The piece was obviously driving the musicIans nuts, and they weren't loath to say so, even after Hy1a himself ar- rived. Stephen Taylor, an oboist, com- plained, "If we had some idea how it's going, we could pull people along Frankly, we're not doing that." Pull- ing people along is, of course, what con- ductors do, and "Trans" was precisely the kind of piece on which the collec- tive intelligence could have been fo- cussed by the clear instructions of a baton- wielding overseer on a podium. Instead, for three hours the group picked its way through the unfamiliar thickets of notes and markings, trying to make the rapidly shifting meters mesh, marking the criti- cal spots where the musicians would look to one another for cues, and quizzing Hy1a-who was sitting on the stage sur- rounded by sheets of the score--about his intentions. They were like students work- ing together on an exquisitely hard math problem. There was a lot of frustration, but it was with the problem rather than with personalities. At only one point did things get tense. "One thing, Mitch," David Jolley, a French-horn player, said to Stern. "I don't thInk you should wave your bow. I thInk it's a bad idea."

There was no Egyptian middle class in the sense we know today, in the first half of the twentieth century. A class-conscious nobility, l'ancien régime, woven around the concept of land owning in the nineteenth century, held sway in court and government. There were only the upper class and the farming masses and urban poor who comprised the bulk of the population. The upper class includes educated youths, who are referred to, in Egypt's extended-family system, as shilla—kinsmen. Labib Habachi, an Egyptologist who can express himself well in English, although French was his second language after his native Arabic, is someone who can speak much about these two classes.

There are just so many places you can take a Halloween kit, so I wasted no time in ordering the Memebox Superbox #59 Halloween Special. What kind of amazing things could hide inside? Let’s have a look.
The description makes some big promises for coming in Memebox’ smallest box. It’s so small one of the products doesn’t actually fit inside the box, it was sticking out from under the lid when I pulled the box from the envelope.
The first thing I notice when opening this box is a strong smell of mold. The box and everything in it smells moldy, and the products appear covered in dust and small hairs. I don’t trust that this smell is intentional, so I’ll skip the swatches for this one.
One set of false lashes with some slight spikiness in them. I have gotten far spookier false lashes in other, non-costume boxes.
Liquid lipstick in the colour of blood. Use as lipstick or paint blood stains in appropriate places.
I’ve seen some amazing designs done as lip tattoos, but this is just a solid colour. I’ve been told repeatedly that lip tattoos are difficult to apply, even more difficult to apply well, and very uncomfortable to wear for more than few minutes. I can’t imagine why you’d choose this over just plain lipstick, especially when there’s a lipstick in nearly the same colour in this box.
The contents are just scary makeup basics, with no guidelines for how to make a look with them. The product card promises this box is “loaded with fun and crafty makeup ideas”, so it definitely sounds like some simple face charts or similar were meant to be included, but there’s just nothing here.
Memebox could have done so much with this box, and just … didn’t. I’m very disappointed, and that’s before taking the moldy smell into account.
This box cost $23 plus $6.99 in shipping. Because of the smell I’m unlikely to use, trade, or even gift any of the products. In other words, this was a complete waste.
Since writing this review, Memebox has changed significantly. They no longer publish frequent & interesting boxes, and they no longer ship outside of the US.
Lip Factory’s September box announces Autumn Arrives, with a product card in delicious autumn colours. It seems obvious that the contents will match the card, with perhaps a lovely orange eyeshadow and a deep orange or berry lipstick?
I certainly don’t mind seeing a gel eyeliner, but the packaging makes me wary. I’ve only seen this particular jar on really cheap eyeliners that dry out ridiculously fast. It’s tiny, narrow, and it’s a long way down to the product. The included brush is only useful for applying goth amounts of liner.
The product is just a little bit too thick and dry to make for easy application. While it’s not hard to make this eyeliner seriously black, it’s difficult to get a smooth line. It dries very quickly.
I did a test application on my eyes. The line ended up very thick even when applied carefully, and I could very much feel the liner on my lids once it had dried. It had some light transfer after just half an hour, although my lids were unprepped. With some primer and powder this will probably perform okay, as long as you like thick eyeliner.
An unbranded angled brush. It’s small and reasonably sharp, and the bristles are comfortably soft. The product card does not mention what kind of hairs are used for this brush, but going by the look and feel I assume it’s synthetic.
Another lip gloss. The packaging is cute. The product has separated and cracked inside the packaging. Next.
Well, this looks nice! The colours may not be exciting, but it’s a good combination for a very wearable everyday look. The size is handy, and the courtesy mirror in the lid isn’t too small to be usable. I like the window in the lid, too. Shame about the useless foam applicator, but everyone provides those.
Unfortunately the pigmentation is nothing to write home about. The swatch shows the absolute most I could get out of these shadows; I jammed the foam applicator so hard into each shadow I’m surprised they didn’t crack. There’s also significant fallout from the matte middle shadow.
The shadows are a little more forgiving with a proper brush, and all in all this is a pretty good palette for someone who is worried about being heavy-handed. I’ll find a use for this on mornings where my makeup has to be foolproof.
I’m not impressed with this box. There’s nothing remotely autumny in this box, and all the products feel really cheap. I wouldn’t be willing to pay the stated retail value of any of these products.
I wonder why I’m still subscribing to this. Oh wait, I’m not. Because of this box I’ve finally cancelled my subscription.
The mission of Superbox #48 Daily Dose of Beauty is to bring something special to every day of the week. My weeks feel far too long far too often, so having a little something to brighten each day is nothing to scoff at!
This all looks and sounds very comfy, and when I say all, let me also say that this box is packed. There’s no tissue paper for padding here, which seems a bit of a gamble with two glass bottles in the pack. Both survived, though!
Screw the strange and random order the products are listed in on the product card, let’s look at them sorted by day.
For Makeup Monday we have … the neutralest eye shadow ever. I already have a dozen eye shadows in this shade or close-enoughs. Not impressed yet.
Three sheet masks in different flavours; Ceramide, Collagen and Panthenol. I already have a pile of different sheet masks and will happily add these to it. While I don’t really feel that such masks make a difference to my skin, setting aside the time to wear one does wonders for my mind.
I’m glad instructions and ingredients are in english on these, because the Memebox product card gives a description and instructions for a lip gloss — specifically the lip gloss that was included in Office Essentials, I believe.
One of the many potential steps in the korean skincare routine, this particular serum is meant to be applied after emulsion. A single squirt is easily patted into the skin, and feels quite nice. I can definitely find a use for this in a comforting pampering routine.
I’ve never heard of hair steam treatments before, so I’ll have to trust the product card when it claims such treatments are expensive, and this product is an affordable alternative.
From the instructions, you wear this hair pack as you would a shower cap. You apply it after towel-drying your hair, let your hair soak in all the super amazing oils for fifteen minutes, then rinse off.
I have very well-behaved hair, and previous experiments with hair oil has only led to intense washing to get the damned stuff out again. I’m not excited for this at all. It’s just a single-use pack, so I might try it when bored, or I might give it away to someone with dry hair.
The hideous buzzwordiness and the lavender fragrance put me off in puke-worthy ways, and I have oily skin rather than the “extremely dry skin types” this product is intended for. No thanks.
I hate the feeling of dry lips, and this lip treatment is adequate for fixing that. It’ll find room in a bag or other.
This is supposed to be a lip essence, lip stick, lip tint, and lip gloss in one. It’s also either broken or really stupidly designed.
What may look like a typical lip stick bullet is a hard plastic tube with liquid inside it. I can twist this tube either way, but I cannot get product to come out consistently. When trying to swatch, I got a great big squirt of product. When trying it on my lips, I only got enough product for 3/4 of my lip surface.
Going by the description, this is clearly a product of pure magic. It does all the good skin things — nourishes! improves! treats! rejuvenates! — while containing nothing bad — no evil parabens! no evil mineral oils! no evil artificial things! Parabens, mineral oil and artificial ingredients are not scary, and I do not have an irrational fear of them. Reading this just makes me annoyed.
The product does feel quite nice on the skin. I don’t have any wrinkles and don’t expect any soon, but I suppose it can’t hurt anything but my pride to use this for the sensation’s sake.
Most of these products are useful, but this box doesn’t excite me. Necessities and comfort items just don’t.
This box cost $29 plus $6.99 in shipping. It contains six full-size products and four single-use packs.
Lip Factory is am american subscription beauty box with a focus on lip products. I’ve subscribed to it for a few months, and my general impression so far is not very good. The boxes are sent out late each month, so shipping time ensures I won’t get it until the following month (and after I’ve been charged for the next box). The packaging was good for the first couple of boxes I received, with a black Lip Factory box inside a shipping box, but they dropped the inner box months back. The filler material inside the box is nasty brown paper strips, which is probably environmentally friendly but looks ugly and smells bad.
In opening the August 2014 box, the first thing I noticed was that all the products were covered in a fine brown dust. The exact same brown as the filler strips. I attempted to clean it off before photographing, so now I have brown dust everywhere on myself instead. Lovely.
Feeling cheeky? Open this month’s beauty box and discover a fabulous, long wearing cheek color to fit your most blushing of moods. This pure mineral blush will give you a beautiful, healthy tone that looks ultra natural. LASplash Mineral Blush creates a soft, radiant glow ideal for all skin types, including sensitive and problematic skin… So don’t be afraid to brush on this blush.
I got this in Beach Party, a pale pink with shimmer. I like the colour a lot, but I’m not sure I want shimmer in my blush.
This blush comes in the form of loose powder in a sifter jar. I’ve had loose powder blushes before, and when I say “had,” I mean I’ve thrown them all out.
We love our gloss here at the Lip Factory! This one from LASplash is a great addition to our addiction. Sheer coverage with a hi-shine finish is the perfect combination for the ultimate hydrated lips. Infused with vanilla mint this non-stick, moisturizing formula is enriched with nourishing Vitamin E and Shea Butter. Beautiful finish and good for your lips… sounds perfect to us!
Train that eye shadow to sit and stay all day and night! Smooth a thin layer of this all natural primer on your lids and demand your eye products to stay put. It’s not only great for eye shadows but absolutely perfect for pigments. As an added bonus there’s no color to it, so it can easily be used on any and all skin tones.
The lid on this jar was loose when I took it out of the box, and the actual product is partially covered in a fine layer of brown dust. Lovely.
I will clean it up and use it, though. Without a good primer I may as well not bother with eyeshadow, so having a stash is essential. While I prefer my primers in packaging that doesn’t require tools to use, I haven’t tried this brand before and look forward to seeing how it performs.
All Cult Nails lacquers are made with a vegan friendly formula, contain no animal byproducts, and are never tested on animals! They are also free of Dibutyl Phalates (DBP), Toulene, Formaldehyde, Camphor, and Formaldehyde Resin.
The list of Scary Nail Polish Chemicals has grown from three to five in the last few years, and I see this one ticks all the boxes. I’m always annoyed to see this list, because it’s 80% scare-mongering. Less bullshit in my cosmetics, please.
That said, I love the look of this polish in the bottle, and I’ve heard many good things about Cult Nails. Looking forward to trying this.
Our name isn’t Lip Factory for nothing! We can’t live without lippies around here. We feel like lipstick is pretty essential to complete a makeup look, and is one cosmetic that few women are ever without! You won’t be able to resist this lipstick from Pink Powder Parlor. This lipstick will glide on effortlessly and won’t slip and slide off your pout. It is Vitamin E enriched which has a soothing and healing property to it and adds much needed moisture to keep those lips, super, extra kissable and who doesn’t want that?
I received this in 301. There is no name or even brand markers on the packaging. Speaking of the packaging, this matte black tube doesn’t just look really stylish, it also offers noticable resistance when opening. This is not going to come open in my bag.
I initially thought this light pink would go on sheer, but nope. This is a full-coverage pink, and it actually doesn’t make my pale face look ghostly. That puts it on a very short list of wearable light pinks for me. Just a shame it’s arriving around autumn time, when I’m more likely break out the wines and berries.
The texture of this lipstick is thick and bit dry. It doesn’t feel drying, but the product sensation is strong. I can very much feel that I have something on my lips, more so than with other lipsticks. It transfers lightly enough that I expect it will survive a cup of tea, and possibly a non-greasy meal.
Wanna add some glam to your completed eye look? We thought the answer would be yes, so we went ahead and added some lashes to your August box! These Red Cherry lashes are designed to create various effects and to naturally accentuate different eye shapes. Made of 100% human hair, these lashes come in various natural and glam styles to add instant wink to your eyes.
I received these in #110. I’ve never worn false lashes, and should I decide to try, I don’t think these would be the place to start. They look kind of scary. Maybe for Halloween?
Lip Factory continues to be 50/50 on the hit and miss for me. The stated retail value for the items I’ll definitely use don’t add up to the price I paid for the box. I continue to wonder why I’m still subscribing to this.
No-makeup makeup is a damned neat trick to know, and one I have yet to master. Can the Memebox Superbox #44 No Makeup Makeup give me a quickstart here? We’ll see.
Sure, the “I just wake up this pretty” look looks simple, but it’s actually one of the hardest looks to recreate! Play up your natural features with an always in style and always wearable barely-there makeup look. Let your skin do the talking with skin perfectors that allow for a flawless and luminous complexion and enhance your features with stunning and versatile natural colors that will give you a refined and elegant look. Finish off with a naturally pretty pout and rosy flushed cheeks, and you’ve just earned yourself a black belt in beauty.
This popular Mineral CC Cushion is wideligy acknowledged for its high level of UV protection and moisture, effective and long-lasting coverage, and its non-sticky, silky after touch previously unfounded in any other CC or Air Cushions. Dab away with the Mineral CC Cushion to feature the ultimate no-makeup look, because it’ll bring out the most natural and healthy-looking glow on your face! Plus, the high concentrates of bamboo water deliver instant soothing and cooling effect, making it perfect to be used in the summer times.
I love cushion foundations. They give a lovely, light coverage, have a pleasant cooling sensation on application, and are handy to carry and re-apply. I love them so much I opened this up despite knowing that #21 is just too dark for me.
Sigh. The downside of cushions is the unhygienic packaging. Since I had already contaminated this cushion with the swatch, I went ahead and tried it on my face. I managed to look at my mask-like visage for almost a full minute before frantically cleaning my face.
On the plus side, the compact case is re-usable. Just pop out the cushion by pushing firmly from the bottom.
I tried inserting the cushion into my Etude House Minnie Mouse case, but the two are not compatible. The Macqueen cushion is about a millimeter too big to fit.
Containing Omega 3.6.9, hyaluronic acid, and 5 different kinds of flower seed extracts, Drww’s Power Lift Strong Cream works to treat skin darkening and wrinkles. The best part of this cream, however, is in its function as a makeup booster. It can also be applied in small amounts along the T-zone for highlighting your features before or after makeup. What’s more, mix it in with a makeup base or a foundation and apply on your face for a naturally glowing and radiant complexion.
I can’t quite place where “makeup booster” belongs in a routine. It sounds kind of like a primer, kind of like a hilighter? A bit of experimenting shows that it works wonderfully as a very subtle hilighter.
The Silky Velvet Primer works to make your skin soft and silky before application of base makeup. Made from “USDA” patented organic ingredients such as rhodiola rosea root extracts, damask rose extracts, and rosemary leaf extracts, this primer is gentle and adheres thinly and smoothly to the skin, filling in all the uneven skin texture and fine lines & wrinkles for a long-lasting, velvet-like skin condition.
I’ve used a number of different primers, and they’ve all been quite similar: Transparent gel that makes the skin look smoother. But this stuff? It’s white, and does not go on transparent. It does not make the skin look smoother at all, quite the opposite — I haven’t seen my pores look this big and defined since Benefit hello flawless oxygen wow!
A whitening, anti-wrinkle, brightening, and moisturizing facial essence Now this Gel Color Pot is a real multi-player when it comes to featuring a natural, no-makeup look. It works as a light snowy-colored shadow and a highlighter all in one! Its texture is cushiony and creamy when applied, and the sublte pearls and sophisticated color formation brings out the best in your complexion.
Enriched with vitamin E, shea butter, jojoba oil, and macademia oil, this Lip Essence works to deeply moisturize dry, chapped lips and protect it from further dehydration by delivering nutrition from within. What makes this lip product so unique is that when applied, it’ll alter its color according to individual’s lip color and PH level. Thus, the vita CC Lip Essence will not only moisturize and care for your lips but also add natural color and radiance at the same time!
Oh, this is the gem of this box. The packing is big and awkward, but the product is outright amazing.
Changing colour “according to individual’s lip color and PH level” sounds like so much woo to me, but this is a clear gel that does gain colour when touching skin. The result is shiny like a gloss, feels like the most intense lip treatment ever, and leaves a light, natural-looking stain.
The Style Perfect Concealer naturally covers up skin imperfections and dark circles and prevents skin tone from darkening throughout the day. The gentle formula soothes the skin yet at the same time strongly adheres to the skin for a long-lasting coverage.
I was overly optimistic about the cushion, but the handy window in the lid means I can clearly see this product is way too dark for me without even breaking the seal. Into the swap box unopened.
The type of products chosen for this box’ theme are good, but the actual products vary so much in quality and usefulness to make this box a gamble.
The description implies that a cheek colour product is included, but there’s no such product in the box.
The stated retail values feel even more inflated than usual in this box, but between the Power Lift Strong Cream, Gel Color Pot and Lip Essence, I think I got my money’s worth.
As a serious travel minimalist, I could not purchase the Memebox Special #25 Traveller’s Beauty Kit fast enough. Finding good travel products is hard, so I will absolutely take a boxful of suggestions!
Whether you’re heading out for a weeked road trip or flying out to your dream vaca destination, there’s no need to say bon voyage to looking your best. Travel light and still look like a million bucks with all your beauty needs on hand with this traveller’s checklist of what to stow when you’re on the go! Packed with all the easy-to-go makeup, skincare, body essentials plus Memebox’s summer special limited makeup pouch to carry your goodies, this Box is a travelling beauty’s delight! Toss these travel-friendly goodies straight into your carry-on, so looking fabulous will be on your itinerary, no matter where your destination!
The box is so packed there’s only a token amount of tissue paper in it, so this all looks very promising!
Enriched with various organic extracts and natural essential oil, Amini’s popular Traveller Kit consists of a Moisturising Body Cleanser for gently cleansing your body and a Moisturising Body Emulsion for re-filling moisture deep down into your skin.
Shower gel and moisturiser in handy travel sizes. I typically bring a bar soap instead of gel to cut down on liquids, but I’ll grab these for a trip where I don’t need to worry about ridiculous liquid rules.
Both products have a distinct scent I can’t quite place. Kind of like a fruity alcoholic drink? It’s quite mild and not bothersome.
The moisturiser is very thin and light, as you would expect an emulsion to be — a western-style moisturiser is much thicker and heavier. This should be perfect for my skin, which only occasionally wants a little bit of moisture, and finds typical lotions far too heavy.
T.P.O’s No-Wash Toner sheet is a cleansing tissue which works to remove even the most stubborn makeup residues from your face without having to rinse off afterwards. This all-in-one cleansing tissue is the perfect beauty essential for when you need to quickly, easily yet thoroughly cleanse all unnecessary gunk out of your face.
Wipes like this is the only makeup remover I bother carrying when travelling. A good cleansing oil may do a better job, but wipes are so much more convenient. Such packs tends to dry out so quickly I only get one trip out of a pack, so having spares is appreciated!
The lid on this is pretty serious, and the sticker underneath even more so. This should preserve the moisture inside for quite a while.
I used a wipe to remove the swatches of the eyeliner and the lip tint, and it fared well against both products. I had to go over both several times to get all the product, but both are intended to be long-wearing.
Easydew EX’s Active Soothing Serum is made from natural Swiss glacier water which works to cool and refresh dry, irritated skin and monk’s pepper berries complex which works to sooth and repair damaged skin.
It’s just as well this is just a tiny sample bottle, because this product smells so strongly that putting in on my face would make me feel sick. It was donated to my mother before I even finished writing this review.
An eyeliner and an eye shadow combined in one smart, easy-to-apply item, ideeb’s Sweet Jelish Eyeliner comes in three most popular eye makeup colors and its softly gliding, creamy gel texture makes it possible for makeup beginners to feature a finely defined and naturally blended look! Plus, it’s totally waterproof and won’t ever wear off from water, tears, or sweat.
It amuses me how Memebox seems to think using eye pencils as eyeshadow is something brand new that koreans only recently thought up.
This is a plain pencil, no twist-up, no built-in sharpener. Considering how eagerly Memebox has thrown pencil sharpeners at me in the past, I find it strange that one is not included in this box.
This is not a very dark black. One swipe goes on grey. There’s a noticable amount of glitter in it. I found it difficult to apply sharply to the eyes, so I’d save this for intentionally smudgy looks.
Refresh with Pure Smile’s handy deodorant-functional sheets with a powder-infused formula that works to clean, refresh, and remove bad odor from sweaty areas of your body.
From the description it sounds like deodorant in sheet form — which would be pretty cool — but I believe this is just scented wet wipes.
Bringing this with me is one less pack I have to buy at inflated airport prices, because flying without wet wipes available is just not happening.
This Aqua Tint is not your average cotton swab, because it combines the functions of a cotton swab and a lip tint in one sensational item! Simply twist one end of the cotton swab and you’ll see how the liquid tint from inside slides down to the other tip! This is the ultimate throw-away type of lip tint to carry around with you wherever you go.
What a weird combination, but why not? Can’t hurt to toss a few of these in my bag next time I’m off into the world.
In opening, these go from weird to hilarious. You know those tampon commercials with the blue liquid? Well… In these the liquid is proper red. The effect is so disturbing I had a very sudden need to figure out how my camera can record video.
The colour applies very sheer. On the lips it looks very natural. It has that very bitter taste that lip tints often have, and feels really drying.
With a strong level of UV protection, this Sun Cream is gentle in its formula (free of mineral oil, talc, tar coloring, benzophenone-4, and artifical fragrance) and works to not only protect the skin but also to hydrate and smooth out the skin texture.
I was hoping for a handy sample-sized bottle when I saw the little box, but no, it houses ten sample packets. I would have preferred a bottle. They could be useful for keeping in assorted places for “I forgot to apply sunscreen and now we’re an hour away from the hotel” moments.
Made from collagen extracts, jojoba extracts, and ascorbyl palmitate widely acknowledged for its moisture lock-in capability, Pure Smile’s Hand Gel in Maldives Dancing Waters will hydrate, clean, and refresh your easily-contaminated hands. It comes in a small, cute packaging and is easy to carry around wherever you go.
This one doesn’t have an entry on the product card, so no official description. It’s a good-sized meshbag in black with a pink zipper. It’s big enough to fit every other product in this box at once.
The fabric feels sturdy enough, but the sewing isn’t brilliant. The end of the zipper is coming out of the seams on my bag.
This box doesn’t feel complete, as in I couldn’t grab just the contents of this box and be ready to go, but it does provide a decent spread of basics.
With only one straight-up nope, this box is a good hit with me. Apart from the cotton swab/lip tint, there isn’t anything brand new or super interesting for me, but with an upcoming holiday getting a stash of travel staples doesn’t hurt.
This box cost $23 plus $6.99 in shipping. It contains five full-size items, one travel-size item (not full size as Memebox claims!) and two samples. No retail values are stated for the samples; they would typically be free anyway.
As you would expect, most of these products are quite cheap. Cost-wise, this box is the worst value I’ve gotten so far, although most of this is stuff I would be buying anyway.

This is describing someone who is … not me. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced anything even remotely like that, nor have I ever desired to. Hopefully I’ll find something I like anyway? The chances are good, because this is the most densely packed Memebox I’ve received so far.
Infused with rosa centifolia flower water, rosa damascene flower oil, and white musk fragrance, this roll-on type perfume can be applied easily and quickly just before heading out for a romantic date or a party out with your girls.
I’m not all that big on smells. My nose seems very sensitive to some component frequently used in perfumes, so most perfumes smell soapy and artifical to me. This perfume falls into that category. There’s a definite rosey scent to it, but it smells like a scented deodorant.
A shame, because I like the packaging. It’s beautiful and roll-ons are as practical as perfume can yet.
A quick spritz of this Water Essence Hair Perfume will deliver moisture and nutrition to your dry hair and and a nice soapy fragrance that’ll rid away any food or cigarette smell at the same time!
It definitely smells soapy. Not particularly nice, but not particularly bad, either. I don’t have dry hair, but I’ll keep this for the “get rid of cigarette smell” promise. While I don’t like this soapy scent, I’ll take it over smoke stink any day.
A liquid-type eye shadow in four of the most popular shades, N.S.M Soft Moose Waterproof Liquid Line is much easier to apply than the average powdery shadows which simply do not last long enough in the state of your exact liking. This liquid shadow offers beautifully pearly, glittery, and glossier finish that fixes your eye makeup perfectly in place all day and all night.
I hate this product just from typing out the name. My fingers nearly knotted themselves in attempting to type out this ugly mess of uppercase, lowercase, and punctuation.
At the same time, I am highly amused. Soft moose? I don’t think that word means what you think it means.
The colour of this product was selected randomly. I received 550 Elegance Purple. It looks and behaves like any other mousse eyeshadow.
Add more definition and volume to your eyes with Secret-Stargirl’s popular girl-group lashes that come in five different styles to match your mood and day!
Containing an anti-wrinkle concealer and a spot concealer in both ends, this Dual Concealer is definitely a must-have for when you’re heading out for a good night out, because Dual concealer will take care of any extra coverage needed or even possible emergency redness of skin or smudges around your eyes.
I’m still looking for that perfect concealer. Could this be it? It does appear to be pale enough for me, and the coverage looks good.
These are high-quality nail lacquers which come in a variety of trendy, radiant, and glittery colors to be worn for any occasion from a party night, a graduation dinner, to even a beach day out! They’ll be a fun, colorful addition to your hands!
The colours of these products were randomly selected. I received OR239 and OR208, neither of which are listed on the product card. They look blissfully glitter and shimmer free.
The search is over, guys! I’ve found the BB cream of lip colours! Moisturising is a common claim these days, and plumping isn’t exactly uncommon either, but exfoliation in a colour product? That’s a new one.
The colour of this product was chosen randomly. I think I received 01 Classic Pink. It’s boring, sheer, and not particularly flattering for my skin. It feels very nice, soft, and balmy against the lips.
Whoever chose the products for this theme knew what they were doing. None of the items feel out of place. Theme-wise, this is the strongest box I’ve received.
The products aren’t the best fit for me, but the concealer and nail polishes will definitely be used.
The very first thing I’m noticing is how small it is. The box is the smallest I’ve seen Memebox do, it barely has room for the product card! I have some doubts about how many amazing and hot trends can fit in a box this tiny, but we’ll see.
Ever wondered how Korean celebrities look so perfectly gorgeous on screen without looking like they have pounds of makeup caked onto their face? Now, you can recreate whatever K-style look you desire with just the tools in this box! Whether you want to go for that signature Korean “no-makeup” look with this perfect porcelain skin, youthful aegyo-sal eyes and gradient baby lips, or want to glam up your style with your favorite K-POP idol makeup trends, this box is a must have for Korean beauty addicts! Unbox the hottest beauty trends in Korea!
If you’re wondering what the heck “aegyo-sal eyes” is, it’s under-eye bags. They’re small, and look very cute on flatter faces where there’s little definition around the eyes. This improves a person’s look by supposedly making them look younger, but honestly, I would say the reason it looks good is much simpler: Aegyo-sal makes it look like a person is smiling.
My caucasian face is not at all flat, and I have such bags naturally. Emphasising them will only make me look incredibly tired, which I’m managing just fine on my own, thank you very much. Hopefully the products for this can be useful for other purposes for me.
Glam up your eyes with jewel glitters which glies onto your eyelids smoothly with just enough pearly effect and, more than anything, lasts for all day and night! With Bbia’s Pigment, it’s possible to feature a glittery, real K-Pop idol-like makeup in no time!
A small jar of loose pigment. Ugh. Exactly two jars of pigment survived my last makeup purge, and for good reason. It’s difficult to get an appropriate amount of pigment on a brush, and it’s easy to bump the jar and get pigment all over the floor. I’ll pass.
The colour of this product was selected randomly. The product card lists the possible colours as 01 Mild, 02 Sour, and 04 Sweet. I received 03.
Swatching this product reveals the true horror: This is not just a pigment, this is full-on glitter. I’ll be finding brown glitter in and around my kitchen sink for days just from swatching.
I’m honestly considering just binning this. I’m scared of it coming open and covering all my swap products in glitter if I put it in my swap pile.
This all-in-one CC cream offers everything from balancing out skin tone & texture, treating fine lines & wrinkles, maintaining the moisture/oil balance, and covering up skin imperfections! There’s no need to worry about which shade it is, because it doesn’t change the skin tone but rather brings out your most naturally glowing complexion.
This description made me vomit in my mouth a little. Apparently CC creams are even more magic than BB creams.
I can give a foundation product “balancing out skin tone & texture” — that’s kinda what they’re for — but I don’t believe a word of the rest. I especially don’t believe not having to worry about the shade, because this product does definitely have colour to it — it blends in okay on my skin, but I’d love to test this claim on dark skin!
Waterproof, long-lasting, and smoothly applying, RiRe’s Luxe Auto Gel Eyeliner in Champagne works wonders for featuring the sweet baby pink daily makeup also highly popular amongst Korean ladies. It can be worn for work, dates, and even a quick walk in the park with your dog.
Waterproof, long-lasting, and smoothly applying, RiRe’s Luxe Auto Gel Eyeliner in Choco Brown is the perfect shade for featuring the popular softened yet defined eye makup that Koreans so enjoy! After all, it’s about how natural your makeup looks but at the same time how far from natural it really is.
Here we have the aegyo-sal products: A shimmery pink pencil for hilighting, and an also shimmery brown for shading. They did not reach me in a brilliant state: In both pencils, the product had detached and falled into the cap. I could gently push them back into place, but the tips on both were destroyed.
These will serve me fine as their original purpose — eyeliners — but I just have to note that both of these pencils give a lot of colour with little effort, and they set quite quickly. I dread to think of the blending required to make aegyo-sal with these pencils.
The mascara brush and the setting wax formula combine to elongate your eyelashes and fix it up for a lasting finish. Various grain, berry, and flower extracts also help maintain healthy lashes.
Memebox works hard to make sure you will never be without a mascara. In this case, a very tiny mascara. Despite the impression the photo might give, this mascara does not have a comically oversized brush. It’s a normal sized brush in a travel- or sample-size container.
The name of this mascara reeks of my favourite logical fallacy, the appeal to nature. Thus I am honour-bound to remind everyone reading that anthrax and hungry bears are perfectly natural, and yet you wouldn’t want to put either on your face.
I hope this mascara is absolutely brimming with lovely preservatives, because I intend to stuff it into my emergency makeup kit and leave it there for months and months.
Adorably cute and petite in its packaging, this blusher is extremely long-lasting with silica components which work to maintain your skin soft and silky. Plus, it’s very easy to carry around and will be perfect for quick makeup fix-ups or finish-ups by adding some colour and radiance to your pale cheeks.
This tiny1 blusher and it’s fluffy puff is indeed adorable. I approve. This will also go into my emergency kit.
The colour is so subtle I’m not 100% certain I found the right spot on my arm when cropping the swatch. At least it will be hard to accidentally do clown cheeks with this.
The colour of this product was randomly selected. Once again the colour is not stated in any language I understand, but it does not look at all pink or purple, so I’m assuming I received 02 Juicy Orange.
There’s a decent amount of colour in this tint, without becoming overwhelming. It feels like a comfortable balm on the lips, and as you would expect from a balm feel, it wears off really easily.
