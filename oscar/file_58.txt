I've racked up a good bit of credit card debt, and while I'm slowly paying it down, it's a pain wrangling multiple bills with different interest rates. My credit union is offering debt consolidation loans with a lower rate than any of my cards—should I take that, use it to pay off all of my cards, and only have one, low-interest bill to pay every month?
If you have unsecured debts that qualify for a debt management plan and secured debts that don’t qualify, a debt management plan can still work. When you sign up for a debt management plan with a nonprofit agency, the credit counselor assigned to your case will offer comprehensive financial advice that can help you pay down all your debts — not just debts governed by your debt management plan.
If you’re looking specifically for a nonprofit credit counseling agency to work with, explore NFCC member agencies, all of which are nonprofit. NFCC member agencies are required to meet eligibility criteria that ensure they are accredited by a third party, upfront about included fees and provide consumers with counseling and financial guidance that can help them improve their finances over time.
Risks: While a secured card can be a great way for your teen to build credit, there are a few potential risks. If your teen misses a payment or pays late, they will incur a late payment fee. Plus, they will also be charged interest on any balances that remain after their statement due date. That’s why it’s key to inform your teen of good credit practices, such as paying on time and in full each billing cycle. Autopay is a great feature that can help your teen avoid missed payments and interest charges.
Do yourself a favor and save some money, too. Don’t believe these claims: they’re very likely signs of a scam. Indeed, attorneys at the Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, say they’ve never seen a legitimate credit repair operation making those claims. The fact is there’s no quick fix for creditworthiness. You can improve your credit report legitimately, but it takes time, a conscious effort, and sticking to a personal debt repayment plan.
Here’s a good example of when a reputable credit repair service can help you do something you may not be able to accomplish yourself. If you have a collection account that’s been sold to a few different debt collectors, it may appear on your credit report multiple times. That information is accurate but having that one debt dinging your credit score multiple times may not meet the “fair” standard Padawer mentioned.
The Capital One® Secured Mastercard® is great for people who may not have the cash available for a $200 security deposit. The minimum security deposit is $49, $99 or $200, based on your creditworthiness. If you qualify for the $49 or $99 deposit, you will still receive a $200 credit limit. This is a great feature, plus you can get access to a higher credit line after making your five monthly payments on time — without needing to deposit more money. This card also comes with Platinum Mastercard benefits that include auto rental and travel accident insurance, 24-hour travel assistance services and more.
If you are a candidate for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you will need to complete mandatory pre-filing credit counseling with an approved credit counseling agency. The cost of this type of credit counseling session is typically $50 to $100. During this meeting, a credit counselor will go over your finances, including your debts and your income, to counsel you on your options.
If you own a home, you might also consider a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit, which will provide you with extra cash. Home equity loans come at a fixed rate, while home equity lines of credit have variable interest rates and follow a flexible repayment structure. Borrowing criteria vary by lender, but the amount of equity you have in your home will at least partially factor into the size of the loan you’re able to take out. More equity tends to equate to better terms.
Much like an Olympian in training, data is essential to tracking your credit-improvement progress. You need to know how things are progressing, where there’s still room for improvement, and when it’s time to trade up for a credit card with better terms. That’s where WalletHub’s free daily credit-score updates come in handy. You won’t find free daily scores anywhere else, and you don’t want to live in the past when you’re running from bad credit.
If we can stress any point more than anything- do not forget to make a payment. If you miss a payment in effort to pay off another line of credit, this can debilitate your credit score more than you think. There have been cases of people claiming a decrease in credit score up to 100 points, which has also been confirmed by Equifax. If you are in a situation trying to pay off multiple loans, start small and tick with the minimum payment. Build a budget where you can effectively manage all your bills and ensure that each of them get paid. Only then can you consider putting more money aside for to eliminate debt quicker However, you should never sacrifice an on-time payment for anything. Otherwise, you are sacrificing 35% of your total credit score.
Yesterday, Margot used Card #3 to buy an $800 flat-screen TV. Although she only used 8 percent of her total credit limit of $10,000, she charged 80 percent of Card #3’s $1,000 limit. While it’s not an exact science, making an effort to even distribute expenses will likely help your score. Next time Margot wants to spend $800, she should take advantage of Card #2, which would only charge 16 percent of its limit. Utilization can be a friend or foe—practice some planning and let this credit repair component work for you.
You cannot sign up for new credit cards, nor can you use the ones you have. While it may sound unreasonable to bar you from using credit, the point of your debt management plan is helping you dig your way out. “The last thing you want to be doing is running up more high-interest debt on the side,” said McClary. “You’re not doing yourself any favors in that situation.”
If an investigation doesn’t resolve your dispute with the credit reporting company, you can ask that a statement of the dispute be included in your file and in future reports. You also can ask the credit reporting company to give your statement to anyone who got a copy of your report in the recent past. You’ll probably have to pay for this service.
I was looking for ways to improve my credit score. I ran across Brandon Weaver youtube page. After hearing his story I purchased his Ebook and his information has helped me tremendously and also saved me $2,000 dollar from other credit companies. It's great knowing that we have people like Brandon helping people learn to repair our own credit at a low cost and get the same or better results than those expensive credit repair company.
One of the biggest pitfalls of debt consolidation is the risk of running up new debt before the consolidated debt is paid off. When you finish paying off credit cards with a consolidation loan, don’t be tempted to use the credit cards with their newly free credit limits. If you think you might, close the accounts. You may have heard that doing so could hurt your credit score, and it might. But you can recover from credit score damage much more easily and quickly than you can recover from crushing debt.
Many credit card issuers will allow you to transfer money to your checking account. Or, they will offer you checks that you can write to yourself or a third party. Check online, because many credit card issuers will let you transfer money directly to your bank account from your credit card. Otherwise, call your issuer and ask what deals they have available for “convenience checks.”
A debt management plan is a formal plan to restructure and pay off your debt. A company will manage the plan and negotiate some cost reductions with your creditors, such as waived fees or a lower interest rate. You’ll make a single payment to the plan manager, who will distribute the funds to your creditors. While you’re in the program, you won’t be able to use your credit cards or open new ones. The plan is designed to get you out of debt in three to five years, after which all of your accounts should be reported as paid-as-agreed.
We’ll explain each of the four pillars of credit repair in detail below. Just remember, each step on its own will not be enough to completely fix your credit. Credit repair, after all, is like peeling an onion: You have to peel away a few layers before you get to the good stuff. But we’ll try our best to make sure your credit recovery doesn’t bring you to tears.
Are you tired of paying a high interest rate on your student loan debt? You may be looking for ways to refinance your student loans at a lower interest rate, but don’t know where to turn. We have created the most complete list of lenders currently willing to refinance student loan debt.

All of these lenders (except Discover) also allow you to check your rate without impacting your score (using a soft credit pull), and offer the best rates of 2018:
With poor credit, you may not be able to get approved for new credit products like credit cards. Although you may still be able to take out an auto loan or a mortgage, you’ll pay a much higher interest rate because of your low credit score. Compared to a borrower with good credit, someone with poor credit can pay $50,000 more in interest on a mortgage. Over an entire lifetime, you could end up paying over $200,000 more in unnecessary interest just because of bad credit.
Kareema Benjamin, who has been a regular contributor to CCN with her fitness column, has recently received the prestigious Fitness Instructor of the Year Award for two Sydney clubs.
Shw has worked with Fernwood Liverpool for five years having left briefly for a stint in Queensland, before returning to the gym in mid 2009. She also became a part of the Wetherill Park Club teaching Body Balance, Body Pump, Cycle, Boxing, Freestyle Aerobics and is also making inroads as a Body Combat instructor.
Lesa Villiotis, Group Fitness Manager of Fernwood Liverpool and Fernwood Wetherill Park, said this of Kareema:
Kareema is a great role model and her passion for her work is a reflection of her devotion to the members and the broader community. She is a supportive and approachable member of the team and we recognise her value and inspirational leadership.
Kareema is a motivating, passionate and professional Group Fitness Instructor who supports women at Fernwood Liverpool and Wetherill Park by turning up class after class, week after week to encourage ladies to get fit and healthy. Kareema provides fantastic Group Fitness Classes and creates an atmosphere that supports women to �be the best they can be�.
�You are a great instructor and I wanted to let everyone know that. Your presence at Fernwood is always positive and caring and you strive to produce your best classes - just looking at your class numbers proves that!�
Yvonne also concluded by saying Kareema is NO.1 at Fernwood. �Thanks again Kareema, you do a great job!�
As well as being an instructor, Kareema is also a wife and mum, a regular contributor to developmental programs for women and also maintains her own fitness clothing range through her business name, KaRa Aktiv
CCN is very proud to have Kareema write for us each week as she does without fail, and while we miss not having her here in Brisbane, her dedication and sound advice is well acknowledged and recognized by CCN readers not just in Queensland but nationally and internationally as well.
On Sunday 6 June, Government House at Fernberg in Brisbane, the home of all the Governors of Queensland, turned 100 years old.
To celebrate this milestone the present Governor of Queensland, Penelope Wensley AO, (pictured below with Janeth Deen) extended an invitation for all the associations she was patron of to join her in setting up displays of their respective organizations.
The Queensland Muslim Historical Society, of which the Governor is a patron, showcased Muslim activity in Queensland under headings such as Education, Aged Care, Youth, Commerce, Health, Welfare, Religion, etc.
The QMHS stall was in the direct path of visitors to the main house and had constant visitors throughout who showed genuine interest in the Society's displays.
The Governor herself paid several visits to the stall and was impressed with the quality and quantity of the displays.
The stall received many requests for Islamic information and messages to be passed on for some of the associations that were showcased.
Janeth Deen, QMHS president, told CCN: "It was a very pleasant and entertaining day but disappointing that we had few of our Muslim brothers and sisters call in to our stall."
Brisbane�s Southside will receive $261,000 to assist in the settlement of newly arrived migrants and refugees, Member for Moreton Graham Perrett told CCN.
Mr Perrett said the Islamic Women's Association of Queensland ($96,000) and Queensland Program of Assistance to Survivors of Torture and Trauma ($165,000) would receive the support as part of the Australian Government�s Settlement Grants Program.
�This funding will help refugees and migrants to become self-reliant, contribute to the national economy and acquire crucial skills and knowledge about life in Australia,� he said.
�On the Southside one in three of us were born overseas and we are a friendly multicultural community.
�That�s why it�s important we assist migrants and refugees to settle successfully into our community.
�These grants will assist in their cultural transition into Australian life and encourage greater social participation.�
In 1975, the Pride of Australia Medal nominee migrated from South Africa with his family to escape a country on the brink of "civil revolution".
He was attracted to Australia for the future it provided for his children, but before long he realised the local Islamic community needed a
In the 1980s he travelled back to Africa to collect donations, eventually raising $150,000 to buy a building in Lutwyche, in Brisbane's north, which is now Lutwyche Mosque.
Dr Mustapha said. "I found that a mosque would be a good central place to facilitate, in a holistic way, general support for these people."
In 2004 he founded the Queensland Muslim Times, which aims primarily to unite the burgeoning Islamic community.
"So we carry some articles (like) What is Islamic culture? Or Why is alcohol frowned upon in Islam?"
Finalists will be revealed in The Sunday Mail on September 5. Queensland winners will be announced at a special ceremony on September 10 and in The Courier-Mail on September 11.
On Friday May 28, 2010 Saalihah Seedat (pictured second from left) presented Crescents of Brisbane as an official guest at the opening of the new satellite service for BreastScreen Queensland at Upper Mt Gravatt.
Also present was Muna Ibrahim (pictured left) of the Islamic Women's Association of Queensland (IWAQ).
Key representatives from the Brisbane Southside and wider Queensland community witnessed Deputy Premier and Minister for Health Mr Paul Lucas, with State Member for Mansfield Mr Phil Reeves, officially open the service.
Mr Lucas toured the new screening service, which is located at �The Village� Shopping Centre on Logan Road, with the Acting Clinical Director of BreastScreen Queensland Brisbane Southside Service, Dr Kate Taylor.
�I am very happy to open a new BreastScreen Queensland Service as screening for early stages of breast cancer is such an important service for the women of Queensland,� Mr Lucas said.
Mr Lucas said the new satellite service for BreastScreen Queensland at Upper Mt Gravatt would help to improve access and convenience for busy women in the target age group to access screening services.
�This new satellite screening service provides women in Upper Mount Gravatt and surrounding suburbs with more convenient access to breast cancer screening services,� he said.
�This is particularly important given we know a growing number of women in the target age group are taking up local BreastScreen Queensland Services.
�Latest figures show 57.3 per cent of the 50 to 69 yearold target age group in Queensland are participating in the BreastScreen Queensland Program, and it�s great we now have a satellite service here in Upper Mt Gravatt for local women to access,� Mr Lucas said.
Mr Lucas (pictired cutting the ribbon second from left) said the transition to digital equipment would be invaluable to clients of BreastScreen Queensland.
�This technology enables breast images to be checked immediately for quality, so women will no longer need to return for a repeat breastscreen if there are technical issues, providing significant benefits for women,� Mr Lucas said.
The new system will enable images to be forwarded electronically rather than physically by courier to larger population centres for reading, which cuts the time between screening and results.
BreastScreen Queensland expects to manage more than 6.5 million digital images captured at its services over the next five years. The Program is on track to screen 235,000 women this financial year, an increase of 18,000 women from 2008-09.
BreastScreen Queensland provides services through 11 screening and assessment facilities, 19 satellite facilities, six mobile and two relocatables at more than 200 locations throughout the state.
BreastScreen Queensland Services on Brisbane�s Southside are conveniently located at: QEII Hospital, Redlands, Logan, Coorparoo, Jindalee, PA Hospital, Inala and now Upper Mount Gravatt.
The teams' first timers took up the challenge from contenders from across the Tasman, New Zealand, Samoa and Tonga.
"Our fighters where by far the best fighters in the tournament, especially the first timers for whom this was their first international tour," a very proud team coach, Haris Olomi, told CCN.
Zulaikha Deen, who was heading for a gold medal, came away with a bronze after taking ill just after her second fight.
"I want to thank all of the parents and the students who have supported the fighters and lost there voices, especially Larry who could not speak the next day," said Olomi.
Retailers and the Reserve Bank are of the opinion that Australians have become more frugal � that is, Australians are more careful about spending money.
It appears that Australians are seeking value in lower priced brands or are only buying when products are on sale.
This has had a major impact on retail sales. Consumer sentiment has fallen for the second month in a row, led in part by rising interest rates; uncertainty with the European economy and its impacts on the Australian stock exchange; the upcoming Federal election; and the handling of the mining tax.
The business was started up two months ago by work at home mum, Sarah B uharie, who strives to source and stock only 100% handmade and Australian products made by independent artisans/crafts people/seamstresses.
The items are mostly unique and rarely found in stores and Ms Buharie told CCN that her shop is like a little street fair � eclectic and fun!
While the website is undergoing construction, Sarah uses a Facebook store front to display her products.

Thousands of young British women living in the UK decide to convert to Islam - here are some of their stories
Over the next few weeks, CCN will bring you the story of one of the five featured women who have converted to Islam.
�As a teenager I thought all religion was pathetic. I used to spend every weekend getting drunk outside the leisure centre, in high-heeled sandals and miniskirts. My view was: what�s the point in putting restrictions on yourself? You only live once.
�At university, I lived the typical student existence, drinking and going clubbing, but I�d always wake up the next morning with a hangover and think, what�s the point?
�It wasn�t until my second year that I met Hussein. I knew he was a Muslim, but we were falling in love, so I brushed the whole issue of religion under the carpet. But six months into our relationship, he told me that being with me was �against his faith�.
�I was so confused. That night I sat up all night reading two books on Islam that Hussein had given me. I remember bursting into tears because I was so overwhelmed. I thought, �This could be the whole meaning of life.� But I had a lot of questions: why should I cover my head? Why can�t I eat what I like?
�I started talking to Muslim women at university and they completely changed my view. They were educated, successful � and actually found the headscarf liberating. I was convinced, and three weeks later officially converted to Islam.
�When I told my mum a few weeks later, I don�t think she took it seriously. She made a few comments like, �Why would you wear that scarf? You�ve got lovely hair,� but she didn�t seem to understand what it meant.
Becoming a Muslim certainly wasn�t an easy way out. This life can sometimes feel like a prison, with so many rules and restrictions, but we believe that we will be rewarded in the afterlife
�My best friend at university completely turned on me: she couldn�t understand how one week I was out clubbing, and the next I�d given everything up and converted to Islam. She was too close to my old life, so I don�t regret losing her as a friend.
�I chose the name Aqeela because it means �sensible and intelligent� � and that�s what I was aspiring to become when I converted to Islam six years ago. I became a whole new person: everything to do with Lindsay, I�ve erased from my memory.
�The most difficult thing was changing the way I dressed, because I was always so fashion-conscious. The first time I tried on the hijab, I remember sitting in front of the mirror, thinking, �What am I doing putting a piece of cloth over my head? I look crazy!� Now I�d feel naked without it and only occasionally daydream about feeling the wind blow through my hair. Once or twice, I�ve come home and burst into tears because of how frumpy I feel � but that�s just vanity.
�It�s a relief not to feel that pressure any more. Wearing the hijab reminds me that all I need to do is serve God and be humble. I�ve even gone through phases of wearing the niqab [face veil] because I felt it was more appropriate � but it can cause problems, too.
�When people see a white girl wearing a niqab they assume I�ve stuck my fingers up at my own culture to �follow a bunch of Asians�. I�ve even had teenage boys shout at me in the street, �Get that s*** off your head, you white bastard.� After the London bombings, I was scared to walk about in the streets for fear of retaliation.
�For the most part, I have a very happy life. I married Hussein and now we have a one-year-old son, Zakir. We try to follow the traditional Muslim roles: I�m foremost a housewife and mother, while he goes out to work. I used to dream of having a successful career as a psychologist, but now it�s not something I desire.
�Becoming a Muslim certainly wasn�t an easy way out. This life can sometimes feel like a prison, with so many rules and restrictions, but we believe that we will be rewarded in the afterlife.�

This is a story: with a recipe. During the Great Depression in 1933 Indians, whites and Chinese in Durban, South Africa, suffered hunger like everyone else.
The kids then discovered that the cheapest curry they could buy (for a quarter penny or half a penny) was made by a vegetarian Indian caste known in Durban slang as the Bania.
The children didn't have plates, and one kid got the bright idea to hollow out a quarter bread, asked the seller to put the bean curry in the hollowed-out bread, and then used the broken bread he's taken out as a sort of eating utensil.
Bunny Chow was what the Indian sugar plantation workers took as their day's food to the lands: curry in hollowed-out bread halves.
Bunny chows are often served with a side portion of grated carrot, chilli and onion salad, commonly known as sambals.
Bunny chows come in quarter, half and full loaves and are strictly a messy fingers affair and the locals find the use of utensils quite amusing.
Cheap and practical ... Today it does not matter what your skin colour or station in life is: Durbanites and people from the Kwa-Zulu-Natal province love their bunny chow ...
Just an observation, the newsletter is great and has advanced from the original. My Mum had been receiving it for many years and it's great to see the advanced CCN.
Is there a section within the newsletter for employment opportunities? If not I think that would be excellent to add and I am sure that you would receive a lot of responses for employment.
[Editor] CCN runs a section called The CCN Centre Link (look out for the logo on the left) whenever we are requested to advertise job opportunities that might be of particular interest to CCN readers. We also include a Jobs Wanted section here for readers with skills that potential employers might need.

Jallaluddin had two tickets for the Soccer World Cup Opening Ceremony at Soccer City in Johannesburg last Friday.
"Who in their right mind would have a seat for the Soccer World Cup Opening Ceremony, the biggest sporting event in the history of the continent, and not use it?"
"Well, actually, the seat belongs to me. My wife was supposed to come with me, but she passed away."
"Oh ... I'm sorry to hear that. That's terrible. But couldn't you find someone else, a friend or relative to take the seat?"

Udinese forward Asamoah Gyan opened the scoring for Ghana after 55 minutes when he converted from the penalty spot, but Oumar Kalabane scored an equaliser for Guinea only ten minutes later. With the game headed for a draw, Muntari rifled a 25-yard shot into the top corner in the last minute of added time, lifting Ghana to a 2-1 win. PSV defender Eric Addo, who played the full 90 minutes, was booked after 57 minutes. Ghana will be next in action on Thursday 24 January when they take on Namibia in their second group stage game.

Surfing is an interesting sport to learn as well and if you want to learn it then, you need to pay special attention to a few basic things such as ‘Understanding the Ocean’, ‘What the basic essential equipment are’ and ‘Various styles of Surfing’. Like any type of sports, the most beneficial and easy way to learn the sport is to just do it and learn. Australia is a top surfing location that attracts surfboarders all over the world every year. So there is now doubt plenty of surfing instructors at all the tourist beach locations who are happy to teach for a small fee.
First you must equip yourself with the right type of equipment to before you start with surfing. The market can be found flooded with various brands and types of surfing equipment to consider from nose protectors to armbands and helmets. You can spend money on any type of equipment you would like to wear while learning as it would be handy and good for beginners. When it comes to buying surfboards there is no need to spend big when only starting out, you can always find a good bargain on last season’s models or if you don’t mind a used surfboard will also do at the start. Remember as you advance your skills you most likely will need to advance your equipment too so there is no need to spend on expensive surfboards while you are learning. All the equipment you invest in will be able to help you surf safely, and remember when starting out you don’t need to venture too far out, particularly if swimming is not your strong suit. That way you will avoid any mishaps during learning.
When you are making the selection of your equipment, you must be careful with the type you choose. It’s really important that you pick the right one and for that you can get tips from experts. Choosing the right surfboard is really important because it’s helps with your balance and buoyancy and hence will help you stand up on them with only a couple of attempts. Choosing the right type of surfboard would make it easy to paddle as well in order to gain the speed required.
Paddling is the most basic part you need to start with when you begin to learn surfing. You need to be able have strong arms to generate enough speed so that when the wave comes at the right moment you can stand up and catch it. Paddling is the most vital part and beginners would be able to learn it very. To learn paddling precisely, one must spend some time and practice a lot. Paddling must be learnt first and in order to proceed with other parts and styles of surfing. The second and third part of learning would be duck diving and wave breaking.
With duck diving you will learn to gracefully go under any unwanted oncoming wave. Without duck diving, you can get washed away very easily with a strong wave. The other technique is wave breaking where you go with the wave in the same direction to enjoy surfing.
With these basics in mind you can be sure that you’ll be off to a flying start when learning how to surf and remember nobody became and expert without putting in the hours so the way to get good is PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE. Good Luck.

In November, a judge gave hope to homeowners trying to collect insurance money for flood damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. Now, that decision is under scrutiny.
U.S. District Judge Stanwood Duval Jr. sided with policyholders who argued that language excluding water damage from some of their insurance policies was ambiguous.
Duval said the policies did not distinguish between floods caused by an act of God - such as excessive rainfall - and floods caused by an act of man, which would include the levee breaches following Katrina's landfall.
Duval allowed a lawsuit against The Allstate Corp. (nyse: ALL - news - people ), The St. Paul Travelers Companies Inc. and other insurers to proceed, but said the issue of "flood exclusion" could be appealed immediately by the companies.
A hearing on the appeal will be held Wednesday at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A three-judge panel was scheduled to hear arguments from lawyers for policyholders and several insurance companies.
Insurers say their homeowner policies do not cover damage from any type of flooding, including water from the levees that broke in the aftermath of the Aug. 29, 2005, storm.
The insurance industry stands to lose an estimated $1 billion in Louisiana if policyholders successfully challenge companies' refusal to cover damage from levee breaches, said Robert Hartwig, chief economist at the industry-funded Insurance Information Institute in New York.
In court papers, a lawyer for policyholders with consolidated cases against insurers said Duval properly concluded that the definition of "flood" in policies is limited to "naturally occurring events."
But plaintiffs' attorney John Ellison accuses insurers of purposely not defining the term 'flood' and deliberately drafting vague policy language "to frustrate the reasonable expectations of Louisiana homeowner policyholders from whom they collected premiums for years."
Lexington Insurance Co. attorneys argue that punishing insurers for failing to define common words like "flood" could force them to engage in "defensive over-specification, which would inevitably lead to longer policies that are less comprehensible to most policyholders."
Duval agreed last year to dismiss State Farm Insurance Cos. from the litigation. He ruled that State Farm's policies included language that clearly excluded all flood damage, regardless of the cause.
The above is not legal advice. That can only come from a qualified attorney who is familiar with all the facts and circumstances of a particular, specific case and the relevant law. See Terms of Use.

Essential Fantastic Four volume 7 is made up of #138 to #159, including #154 which contains a reprint of a Human Torch story from Strange Tales, plus Giant-Size Super-Stars #1 which morphs into Giant-Size Fantastic Four #2 to #4 and Avengers #127. Bonus material includes early versions of the covers for issues #141, #155 and #156. Approximately the first half of the regular series plus the first two Giant-Sizes are written by Gerry Conway. The rest of the regular series is mainly by Roy Thomas with individual issues by Len Wein and Tony Isabella, the reprint by Stan Lee with a framing sequence by Wein, the remaining Giant-Sizes by Gerry Conway & Marv Wolfman and Len Wein & Chris Claremont, and the Avengers issue by Steve Englehart. The art on the regular and Giant-Sizes is nearly all by John Buscema, Rich Buckler and Ross Andru with the reprint by Dick Ayers with the framing sequence by Bob Brown and the Avengers issue by Sal Buscema. That's a lot of creators and so there's a separate post for some of the labels.
This volume contains the first four issues of Giant-Size Fantastic Four although the first comes under the awkward full cover title of Giant-Size Super-Stars featuring Fantastic Four. These are mostly written by the contemporary writer on the regular series but none of them tell particularly critical adventures and instead we get a series of standalone tales. Given the nature of the contemporary comics market with nearly all distribution still being via newsstands where not all titles were carried this may have been a wise choice in 1974 (indeed I've heard it claimed that none of Marvel's Giant-Size issues made it over to the United Kingdom back in the day), and even today Marvel's digital releases on Comixology are often very patchy when it comes to both annuals and Giant-Size series. But in a collected edition with them all contained together it feels like an opportunity missed. We get another fight between the Thing and the Hulk, an odd tale in which the Fantastic Four's postman Willie Lumpkin stumbles into a time machine and accidentally changes the course of history under the machinations of the mysterious Tempus, and a battle with the alien Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (nothing to do with a later group by the same name). The final issue in this volume seems to be an attempt to introduce a character who will go on to be a big star in some other series, and even has Professor X show up at the end to use his powers to bring about a resolution. However Jamie Madrox the Multiple Man doesn't come across as a very interesting character in spite of a back story that establishes him as the ultimate loner, forced to grow up in isolation and trapped in a full body suit designed to contain his powers. It's easy to spot the influence of Chris Claremont on what I think is his earliest ever work on any of the X-Men characters and concepts, although it's a rather indirect link given that Multiple Man wouldn't make it into the All-New X-Men and would stay on the periphery for many years. Overall these Giant-Sizes show themselves up as glorified annuals by another name and at a greater frequency.
The issues in this volume covers most of the period of Medusa's membership of the Four. And it can't be truthfully be said she makes the greatest impact. Part of the problem is that her powers operate in a way that is far too similar to Reed's, thus rendering her somewhat redundant at times. She shows a strong sense of daring and character and is clearly a far cry from the weak shrinking violets that so many of the female heroes of the Silver Age had been portrayed as. Yet for all this and her friendliness with the rest of the Four she just never quite feels as though she truly belongs. Part of it is the lack of a direct history with the others that makes her a natural part of the family. She may be the sister of Johnny's ex (although in one story she's relegated to being one of the many cousins) but that isn't a particularly direct link and not much is ever made of it. Nor is her role as an emissary for the Inhumans in the humans' world. Instead she's left as someone who may care for the others - in particular she is quite supportive of Reed throughout his marriage difficulties - but doesn't really seem to fit in with them. When at one point she declines to free the others from a prison and instead rushes off it actually feels like she could have turned traitor, but this doesn't feel like it was the plan all along. All in all her presence doesn't make the greatest of impacts and it's easy to see why her time in the Four is so easily forgotten even though she is around for nearly thirty regular issues, only leaving in the final pages of this volume.
In terms of character development Johnny and Ben are left largely to their own devices for much of the volume, perhaps because both were appearing regularly in team-up books that gave more scope for in-depth exploration. Johnny does get a little attention here as he faces up to fears about being increasingly outdated in his look and chat-up lines, but right at the end he's reunited with Valeria, a lady from the Fifth Dimension whom he met in one of the earliest of his 1960s solo tales back in Strange Tales.
But it's Reed and Sue who have the greatest development throughout this volume. It begins with them still separated but with the hope that they might reconcile soon. However hope is dashed when Annihilus captures not only the current Four but also Sue, Franklin and Agatha Harkness. In the course the adventure the insect (who is now given an origin) tries to use Franklin to tap into a great power source but it goes wrong and Franklin's power levels start building up towards dangerous levels. Facing the prospect of a psychic blast that could wipe out all life in the Solar System, Reed grabs an untested device in the form of a gun and blasts his own son. The effect turns off Franklin's power and his mind, rendering him a vegetable.
To say Sue is furious is an understatement. She is not convinced by all Reed's talk about the danger. All she sees is a man who treated his son with the same indifference that he might treat a gas leak. And she's not alone, with both Ben and Johnny also turning away in disgust though both are soon drawn back into the Four when Doctor Doom kidnaps them all as part of his scheme to destroy almost all free will on the planet. Then the two plus Medusa encounter yet another race in the Himalayas that are the supposed basis for the myth of the Yeti, with a would-be tyrant called Ternak seeking conquest. But Sue is not part of this and continues her absence from the team. Instead she finds shelter with Namor the Sub-Mariner and files for divorce from Reed. The moment when the others find Reed sunk into a chair holding the formal court summons is a chilling opener to a tale in which they think they're out to rescue Sue from being held against her will, only to find she has chosen Namor instead. The Frightful Four minus one provide a distraction before Namor summons sea monsters from the depths to seemingly attack the surface world once more. In battle Sue slowly realises how she and Reed truly feel about one another and reconcile. Unbeknownst to either of them the whole thing was staged by Medusa, Namor and Triton to get the couple back together, with Namor having no real intention of conquest.
Although she is back with Reed, Sue does not immediately rejoin the Four. Franklin is cured when at the wedding of Crystal and Quicksilver Ultron attacks through the body of Omega the Ultimate Alpha and uses a weapon to try to destroy minds but instead restores the child's who immediately destroys the android. It's a bit contrived but works to make issue #150 a happy ending issue all round as Crystal marries the man of her choice (hence the crossover with Avengers) and Johnny accepts it all. But Sue doesn't truly return until another adventure with the Inhumans when the Human Torch's old foe Xemu from the Fifth Dimension conquers the Inhumans as a launching point for wider conquest and destruction. Reed tells Sue to stay behind and the others rush to free the Inhumans. But salvation comes only because Sue stores away and shows great initiative in using Xemu's equipment to her own advantage, making a striking return to the Four as a much stronger and more powerful character than before. But just as one returns another leaves with Medusa opting to return to the Inhumans and especially Black Bolt.
Elsewhere we get another Silver Surfer saga that follows up on threads from his own original series with the revelation that Shalla Bal is on Earth and under the control of Doctor Doom. Once more Doom seeks the Surfer's Power Cosmic only this time he transfers it into a new Doomsman robot. The tale has a bittersweet ending as the Surfer leaves believing "Shalla Bal" to only be a Latverian woman who looks like her and was given false memories, but we learn that in fact those are the false memories and Mephisto has once again used Shalla Bal to torment the Surfer. With the story ending with Shalla Bal on Earth with false memories and nobody out of her, the Surfer, the Four or Doom any the wiser, it's a surprisingly downbeat ending and the story is not followed up here.
Other past characters return in various tales with the Miracle Man attacking Wyatt Wingfoot's tribe and gaining power beyond mere hypnotism, or an epic exploring Thundra's origins in rival alternate futures, one dominated by women called Femizons and the other by men under the rule of Mahkizmo, with the male members of the Four dismissed as week and "effeminate". The two worlds are soon set to rights but in the process Thundra is left in our time as an anomaly. Deadline problems lead to an issue with a substantial flashback to an old Strange Tales adventure in which Johnny and Ben battled the "Mystery Villain" whose identity was painfully obvious (maybe the real mystery was why anyone thought it would fool any readers). Now in the present day someone else has adopted the identity.
Overall this volume is a mixed bag. It may show a lot of the Bronze Age traits such as trying to introduce The Next Big Thing and instead debuting a rather forgettable foe, rehashing earlier adventures, having auxillary issues that are unnecessary to the main saga or the dreaded reprint fill-in, but there's more as well. There's actually a real sense of direction to Reed and Sue's story as they come to learn more about both each other and themselves. There's also a real attempt to actually mix up some the main ancillary elements of the series to present strong new takes on them instead of just retelling the same old tales. Although it's by no means a rise to past glories, this volume shows the series making a concerted effort to pull itself forward.

Salty Sex Toy Critic, Dildo Burner, Sex Toy Myth Buster – Sex blog with a focus on sex toy reviews and education
Well, this is going to be a hard review to write. I hate phoning it in, but the bulk of the review has already been written before – the Hot Octopuss PULSE II SOLO, whose counterpart is the PULSE II DUO, was originally just one toy: the Hot Octopuss Pulse. It was meant for solo OR couple’s play and while it had some flaws and areas of improvement, it was an item my husband really enjoyed. And how you use it, how it works, has remained the same. They’ve changed the buttons and added in pulsating patterns but the gist remains the same – apply to penis, vibrate, ejaculate.
Most people out there don’t treat sex toys like the latest iPhone; they don’t purchase the upgraded version when their older version functions just fine or even just “good enough”. For those who DO purchase upgraded versions, you’re in luck: just about everything you wished they would change, they did. There’s now a dedicated on-off button on one side, and intensity controls on the other side. You now have the added option of pulsating patterns. And finally, the blessed thing is more quiet. Not “whisper quiet”, but it’s a big change. In order to make it more quiet, though, they did have to shave some intensity. My husband enjoyed the intensity of it, the deep rumbles of the vibrations, but he doesn’t feel they tamped it down too far. It’s still intense on the upper levels. But wait, there’s more: The Hot Octopuss PULSE II is now waterproof. Before it wasn’t even splash-proof.
Hot Octopuss decided to make two versions this time around. With the new PULSE II DUO you have the *option* of turning off the exterior vibrations, and you have a remote to help control things (which is a necessary upgrade for using it this way). With this distinction in models, it allows for one version to cost less (there’s a $40 price difference), so that’s nice. Those who only ever plan to use it solo aren’t penalized with the higher price tag for the dual motors and remote. Reports have come in that the external motor on the PULSE II DUO is stronger than the one on the original Pulse, but is not rumbly like the interior motor and can actually overpower the interior motor for the penis because the higher-pitched motor wins out, in a bad way. I never found the design comfortable to use as a couple’s toy especially because it gives very broad stimulation and I need pinpoint.
The silicone wings still accommodate a large range of cock girths. With a lot of lube, you can use it in motion but as with the original Pulse, my husband felt that it’s best keeping it in about the same spot – that sensitive point on or near the frenulum. I think that for some people, this sweet spot location will vary slightly. The vibrating pad that gives off the most sensation is about the size of a quarter. How do you know if you’re going to like this sort of sex toy? I’d suggest first trying out a regular vibrator, one that’s very powerful. Good test subjects would be the Vibratex Mystic Wand, the We-Vibe Tango or Touch or any very powerful and rumbly vibrator that you or your partner already have on hand – if you don’t have an immediate “WOW” reaction to the level of vibration, then it’s not really strong enough to give you a good idea of how the Hot Octopuss Pulse II Solo will feel. Some people respond well to concentrated vibrations, and some don’t. Before you drop $99 – $139, you should be certain this is something you’ll enjoy.
Since I wrote my original review, I’ve heard from a number of people with erectile dysfunction who rave about this and its ability to provide pleasure and orgasm even if they can’t get a stiff erection (which would be necessary to use penetrative masturbators). I’ve even heard from a few disabled people who find the Hot Octopuss Pulse much easier to manipulate and use versus penetrative masturbators. We still feel that it’s not totally hands-free because applying a little pressure to keep the vibrator on-point is necessary but it requires less effort than many sex toys for penises. In my original review my husband loved it but felt it would be better with some upgrades – and all of those have happened. So if you were waiting around on them to make a better, updated version then you’re in luck. We don’t have anything bad to say about this sex toy!
The Hot Octopuss PULSE II SOLO comes highly recommended from us both, and can be had for $99 from the lovely Shevibe, who graciously sent me one ages ago in exchange for my honest review.
Thanks for this and the original review! The store where I work just got these in and they seem prettyh neat. Glad to read it comes recommended. I’m also glad I clicked on the “blog” section because I hadn’t seen this on the review page (the one I have bookmarked) – is this intentionally not tagged as a review? Whatever the case, thanks for the awesome site and the work you put in!
Oops. Only bc I fucked up with the categories :) but there’s usually great posts that are not reviews too so checking on the main domain, or signing up for the newsletter, is maybe a good idea!
I am SCI and diabetes. I have not had an orgasm in 11 years. That is before the accident. I want to get one of these. There is a good vibes store near me in Brookline,MA.
Ok but if it’s got a motor, chances are pretty damn good your sex toy is made in China. Even really good brands are. It’s just a fact of life. I believe the Pulse has a warranty.
this thing is garbage. save your money. I lost mine. does nothing. feels like a battery charger on your balls. pathetic. I wish I could litigate for a refund.
I was disappointed. I followed the manual to the letter, and still managed to damage it on the first use. I have to turn it up to max intensity to get the plates to start moving, and even then, any amount of pressure causes them to stall. That’s when laying down on top of it.
I thought maybe I could sit up and let it hang off my shaft and buzz there, like a blowjob, but the wings can’t even keep a good grip, even when dry (I tried talc powder, too). There’s just not enough to wrap all the way around.
I got mine on sale from Shevibe (who made damn sure that I understood that since this was a sale item, no returns or exchanges would be accepted, and that it had been “tested and guaranteed to function”, in big bold print), right before Hot Octopuss announced the launch of the PULSE III. So that leaves me fucked and double-fucked and fucked again.
“Returns and exchanges” being an umbrella term for most manner of refunds. “The thing we sold you doesn’t work? Fine, we’ll refund your money, but you’ll have to send it back. Can’t have you just -saying- it doesn’t work to get your money back.”
I’m still ‘actually’ waiting on a response from HO. Which I can tell you is very probably going to be “We don’t support that series anymore. If you’d like to purchase a Series III, please visit one of the following retailers”.

Building a quality high school is important to the Board of Directors and the Building Committee. One important aspect of quality is assuring the different building systems perform according to their design. These systems including heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), plumbing, electrical, life-safety, and security. Another impact aspect of quality is assuring the different elements of the building envelope (walls, doors, windows, etc.) are installed correctly to keep the building dry and energy-efficient. The process of testing and verifying that all of these systems work as designed is known as “commissioning.”
In September 2017 the Board of Directors took an important step forward in accepting the recommendation from the Building Committee to hire the engineering firm of Rist-Frost-Shumway (RFS) Engineering of Laconia, New Hampshire to serve as an independent, third-party commissioning agent for the high school construction project. Their selection followed a competitive process overseen by the Sustainability and Building Systems Committee, who publicly solicited proposals and interviewed different firms. RFS Engineering is experienced in serving as both the design engineer and commissioning agent for schools throughout New England.
The total cost of commissioning services is $192,920. The construction budget includes additional local funds to support a more robust scope of commissioning work, including RFS engineers conducting third party reviews of the engineering drawings and specifications during the design development process, and conducting additional testing of the building envelope.

Monday night, fans of Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta were surprised by a picture that started circulating on social media.
All of the hard work paid off for the rapper who has been walking around with his heart on his sleeves.
The television star went on a diet and launched the silly “Find the Bam” operation where he strolled through the streets of Miami and Atlanta searching for his former ladylove.
However, it seems that it all worked out for the best because as the cameras were rolling, they decided to lock lips and not let go.
In early August, Erica Dixon’s baby daddy dropped several posts pleading with Benson to give him a second chance, including the one below that, went viral.
He stated: “My #TBT is this woman I love and miss u in my life,” the Atlanta-based rapper wrote via social media on Aug. 9. “I ain’t gone lie sh*t got real crazy, and a mf dipped when it got too heavy. Cause yean never do nothing that f**ked up, real ni**az f**k up too, and I ain’t afraid to say, not saying yean did non that hurt me but never no wack hoe sh*t. Wish u the best my best friend, my ol lady I truly LOVE U #IApologies.”
At that time, Benson said she was moved by the gesture but was not ready to let him have her heart again.
It is worth noting that the lovers were engaged to be married, but he cheated on her with strippers in Florida.
She revealed: “It is cute; it is a nice start for him.But, he is going to have to do a whole bunch more. He is going to have to show a lot more [romantic gestures] going forward.”
I’m so happy for them. I pray that they will unite in matrimony. I think that Scrappy is serious about her. I also feels that she loves him. Kudos to the both of them. You’re in my prayers! Yes, yes, Yes! I love those two together.
So in two weeks it went from Scrappy desperately looking for Bambi online to him getting his body revenge to now they’re back in love. These shows aren’t reality.

The European Union has extended the sanctions against Russia by six months. The sanctions were activated in 2014 as a response to the Russian annexation of the Crimea. Later the sanctions were linked to the carrying out of the Minsk accords, which aim for a cease fire in Eastern Ukraine. For now the country remains full of unrest.
Unlike previous extensions there was little attention paid to it in the run up. In previous years when the decision was made there was some protests from member states, national government or lower government.

This decision has no short term consequences on the boycott of fruit and vegetables from Europe that Russia imposed as a response to the sanctions. Russia announced they would be maintaining the boycott until the end of 2018 when the sanctions were last extended. In the European Parliament last month there were parliamentarians who agreed that the EU should be doing more to tackle the consequences of the boycott. European Commissioner Hogan responded that there were enough measures in place to limit the damage of the boycott.

These third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the Services with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information. These advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the Services or on another Channel. Likewise, third party vendors may serve you advertisements when you visit the Services based on your interaction with the Services and other Channels.
The specific providers we use for OBA are subject to change. For a list of some of the applicable providers, click here. For information about how to opt out of tracking methods for these entities and others, click here. For more details about OBA and opting out, see Section 15 below.

We store page views, clicks and search terms used for ad personalization targeting separately from your Personal Information.

In Processing your User Information in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy, we may rely on one or more of the following legal bases, depending on the circumstances:
Consent: We may Process your User Information where we have obtained your prior, express consent to the Processing (this legal basis is only used in relation to Processing that is entirely voluntary – it is not used for Processing that is necessary or obligatory in any way);

Compliance with applicable law: We may Process your User Information where the Processing is required by applicable law;

any relevant third party acquirer(s), in the event that we sell or transfer all or any relevant portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation);
any relevant third party provider, where our Services use third party advertising, plugins or content. If you choose to interact with any such advertising, plugins or content, information about your activities on the Services and Channels to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests may be shared with the relevant third party provider. If you click or tap on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria;

Where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where Crmpck advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, Crmpck reserves the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no User Information identifying a specific user is disclosed.
Crmpck and some of our advertisers may use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements, for OBA or otherwise, and perform related services when you interact with the Services. Often, these third party advertising companies employ cookies and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of website, app and email advertisements and to create a record of interaction with our content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites or applications, or for reporting website traffic, app use, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on the Services. We also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.
We may also sell or transfer Online Data to certain third parties such as advertisers who will use this data to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests, and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of this information. Some of these third parties may combine the Online Data with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture.

2 WHAT IS GENERATIONS OF FAITH? GOF is a monthly faith formation gathering for families with children in grades pre-k through 8 as well as for people of any age who wish to grow in faith Children attend with at least one adult family member who provides guidance and support for the child while nurturing their own faith Sessions are connected to upcoming feasts & seasons of the church year encouraging participation at Mass At home materials are provided to expand learning
4 OUR OVERALL STRUCTURE In conformity with the Catechism of the Catholic Church, Generations of Faith is based on a six year cycle with a different catechetical theme for each of the six years. It does not matter when a family starts the program, as it will cycle around every six years
6 HOW WERE THE THEMES CHOSEN? These themes were chosen to include the four pillars of the Catechism of the Catholic Church: Creed, Sacraments, Morality, and Prayer We also incorporate the National Directory for Catechesis criteria to include Liturgy, Justice and Scripture study.
18 WE THEN BREAK INTO AGE APPROPRIATE BREAKOUT GROUPS FOR A MINUTE LESSON Children in grades pre-k through 5 stay with their parents, guardians or grandparents
25 MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS Join their peers and work with a trained adult who facilitates a lesson on the session topic Learn through discussions, crafts, skits, videos, worksheets, guided meditations, Bible readings Often present what they learned later to the whole group
26 PARENTS OF MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS & OTHER PARISH ADULTS Attend an adult group facilitated by a trained adult staff member or volunteer Study the session topic through presentations, discussions, video, worksheets, Bible readings, guided meditation, prayer
30 OUR OBSERVATIONS Children are engaged and actively participating in their learning Parents are engaged in their children s faith development as well as their own Children are learning/retaining material from session to session, year to year Parents are able to reinforce learning at home by participating with their children Some families are participating more in Mass, prayer and in faith discussions More opportunities exist for volunteerism, beyond teaching Better able to include those with special needs Improved discipline with parents being present
31 MORE OF OUR OBSERVATIONS Students are better prepared to participate in Sacramental celebrations (i.e. First Communion and Confirmation) Children look forward to their GOF sessions Attendance rates have improved More consistency for all participants regardless of session attended or facilitator, all participants are being exposed to same subject matter and methods. Wonderful opportunity for community-building Easier to recruit volunteers than in traditional model Opportunity for adult faith sharing & adult faith development (re-learning or learning anew)
32 IN THE WORDS OF OUR ADULT PARTICIPANTS. GOF helps reinforce and fill in the blanks in our own education. It keeps the whole family on the same lessons so that discussion is easier. Family involvement means that parents care kids pick up on this and also learn by example. For the kids there are so many ways that a subject is covered during a session it has impact. It has more opportunities for faith-sharing; modeling virtues or behaviors we would like our youth to adopt or continue. Also, those seem to be more readily assimilated when our kids see others share those same values or characteristics, so they don t just dismiss parents as not like REAL people. GOF encourages accountability within the whole family to actually live what we ve learned.
33 MORE FROM OUR ADULTS I enjoy the real world adaptation of the teachings. The focus is on living the values vs. simply learning them. Faith as a community is just as important as your personal faith. It s nice to be here with family & friends. Community building is a big strength. It s great to have an activity outside of school or the ball fields where people can meet friends and share their faith. Adults are able to share their knowledge with the kids. Kids can see the learning never stops. I believe it provides opportunities for families to grow together in faith discussing faith based issues and growing in Christ as a family.
34 FROM OUR YOUNGEST PARTICIPANTS GOF is fun & it teaches a lot. I like the crafts and activities. I like the video clips. I like getting together with other people. I like singing & learning new songs. I like learning about God and other awesome things with my family. I like learning about Jesus. I am learning more about my church. I like the icebreakers I like the presentations
35 FROM THE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS I like the group discussions I like the family experience I like getting to know other people in town. I m impressed with the kind people who work to make this work! At GOF you get to do fun projects and have good conversations. This is better because you get to work with family. It s more convenient and it s all at once so you get more out of it. It increased my learning ability. We gather together and discuss important topics. It s kind of more hands on. GOF is more proactive.
37 WHY DOES GENERATIONS OF FAITH HAVE EVENTS AS WELL AS FESTIVALS? Generations of Faith seeks to prepare all ages and generations for meaningful participation in the life of the Church. The festivals are what we call our learning sessions. Each festival assists participants in a greater understanding of an upcoming Mass or Liturgical season, which is what we call our event. Participants attend the festival in order to better participate in the event festival attendance in and of itself is not enough for faith development.
38 WHY IS EACH FESTIVAL 2 1/2 HOURS LONG? Generations of Faith is not based on a typical classroom-style setting. In order for us to incorporate a variety of activities and experiences as well as build community, we need to have an extended period of time. Don t worry it s not like spending a full 2 ½ hours sitting and listening to a lecture. There s ample opportunity to move around, talk, and do a variety of activities. The time also includes the meal. The best advice is to get engaged as much as possible and then the time flies by!
39 WHY DO CHILDREN NEED TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY AN ADULT FAMILY MEMBER? The Church has long taught that parents are the primary educators in the faith. Our role as a parish is to provide as much support as we can to assist parents in this important responsibility. With the Generations of Faith model, parents and children are provided an opportunity to learn and grow in faith together as a family.
40 HAVING ONLY ONE SESSION A MONTH, HOW WILL MY CHILDREN GET THE REINFORCEMENT THEY NEED TO LEARN ABOUT THE CATHOLIC FAITH? We don t expect that Generations of Faith, once a month, is the only time families learn and practice their faith. For children to grow up knowing what it means to be Catholic, parents need to bring them to Mass so they can participate in the Eucharist and be part of the parish community. In order for children to learn to pray, parents need to pray with their children and need to make faith part of the family s daily lives. Unless parents make being Catholic a central part of family life then anything that is learned in GOF or in weekly classes lacks context in children s lives.
41 HOW WILL MY CHILD LEARN HIS/HER PRAYERS? The only way to learn prayers is through repeated practice. This can not be accomplished solely through monthly or even weekly religious education classes. To assist children with learning their prayers, join them in prayer each day or night, focusing on a particular prayer until they have mastered it. Prayers will be provided in the home kits to assist parents in helping their children learn their prayers. Bringing children to weekly Mass will help them learn their Sign of the Cross, Our Father & Creed.
42 WHAT HAPPENS IF WE CAN T MAKE OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED MONTHLY SESSION? Our attendance policy requires attendance at a minimum of 5 out of 6 sessions to complete the year. Since the same session is offered four different times each month, it is possible for families to request to attend a different session if they are unable to make their scheduled session. (In addition to 6 sessions in Middleboro and 2 in Rochester). Families will need to contact the coordinator prior to making the change to check on the availability and make arrangements to switch sessions.
43 WILL THERE BE LOTS OF OVERLAP IF MY CHILD SPENDS GRADE K 5 IN THE FAMILY GROUP? No, not at all. The lessons are different each year due to the different themes and subjects being studied. Since the program is based on a 6 year cycle, a child beginning in Kindergarten would experience a different theme all the way through the fifth grade. We are continually working to improve the lessons from year to year so even lessons from the same theme year are different than they were six years ago.
44 WHAT IF SOME OF THE MATERIAL IS TOO HARD FOR MY CHILD OR OVER HIS/HER HEAD? Don t be overly concerned. Children s ability to understand subjects vary greatly from child to child and age to age. No one knows your child better than you do, so feel free to help your child as much as he or she needs and to modify any activity to suit their needs and understanding. It s not necessary for the children to comprehend every detail. Your presence with them, sharing in the development of their faith, and carrying the principles into your home are the most important things they can learn.
45 IS THIS PROGRAM SUITABLE FOR THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS? All children are different but our experience has been that many children with special needs have been able not only to participate but also thrive in this environment, especially with a parent close by to make any necessary modifications. We are committed to working with parents to provide any necessary accommodations and to include children of all abilities.
46 WHY DO THE MIDDLE SCHOOL YOUTH GO TO A SEPARATE BREAKOUT GROUP? Students in this early adolescent age group need the opportunity developmentally to discuss and share faith experiences with their peers. They do however still need to discuss matters of faith with their parents as well. By attending the breakout session on the same topic that their parent is studying either in the adult group or with a younger child in the family group, the adolescent and parent are provided an opportunity to continue the discussion at home.
47 DOES GOF PROVIDE THE NECESSARY PREPARATION FOR MY CHILD S FIRST COMMUNION? Yes and No. Generations of Faith provides a wonderful opportunity for first communicants to experience the community life of the Church and learn their theology. GOF does not however provide all the necessary specific instruction to prepare for First Reconciliation and First Eucharist. To address this need, separate learning materials will be given to all level 2 students on First Reconciliation and on First Eucharist. Additional practices and learning sessions will also be offered throughout the year as needed.
48 WHAT IS A HOME-KIT? WHAT DO I DO WITH IT? The home-kit provides additional resources for participants to foster their festival learning at home as they prepare for the event. Kits include prayers, reminders, review sheets, service suggestions, adult faith material & child activities. Participants are urged to use whatever aspects of the home-kits meet their needs and share the other materials with relatives or friends.
49 WHY DO WE HAVE A MEAL? Many of our families come straight from school, work or activities, this gives them a chance to eat. More than providing nourishment, this gives us time to get to know other members of our parish as we break bread together.
50 WHY DO WE ALWAYS HAVE PIZZA & SALAD? It is very difficult to prepare a meal to serve 150+ people six times within one week. Pizza is easy to order and is inexpensive. In the past in Middleboro, when we used to offer a different meal each month, some participants did not always like what was served. Pizza was the most universally liked food.
51 IF I M NOT EATING THE MEAL, WHAT TIME DO I NEED TO ARRIVE? Even if you re not eating the meal, we encourage everyone to arrive at the scheduled start time so that all can join in this important community-building time. There are always table activities as well as conversation with other table members to occupy those who are not eating the meal.

1 Gina Maisto Smith Gina Maisto Smith is a partner in the White Collar Litigation and Investigations Practice Group of Pepper Hamilton LLP, resident in the Philadelphia office. Ms. Smith chairs a national practice focused on the institutional response to all aspects of sexual misconduct matters. Before joining Pepper, Ms. Smith was a partner with Ballard Spahr in Philadelphia. Before that, she spent nearly two decades in the Philadelphia District Attorney s Office where she investigated numerous cases, handled more than 100 jury trials, and developed unmatched experience in the investigation and prosecution of sex crimes and child abuse. She also trained prosecutors, investigators, and police in handling the most difficult aspects of sex crime investigations Direct Fax Ms. Smith is frequently called upon to advise colleges and universities about sexual misconduct policies, changes in the law, and investigations into allegations of sexual misconduct, including sexual violence. She regularly conducts policy audits and assists in the development of policy and in the design and implementation of internal and external operating procedures. She conducts training for multiple university constituencies, including Title IX coordinators, sexual assault response teams, judicial hearing boards, investigators, and members of the campus community. Ms. Smith also helps clients integrate the requirements of all federal, state, and local regulations (including Title IX and the Department of Education s Dear Colleague Letter of April 4, 2011, the Clery Act, criminal law, HIPAA, and FERPA) with their policies and procedures. She also assists with conducting sexual misconduct investigations. Ms. Smith s depth in child abuse investigation and prosecution enables her to assist clients in meeting their child protective services compliance requirements. The Archdiocese of Philadelphia hired her to conduct a review of cases and internal procedures following a grand jury indictment of several priests accused of sexual abuse. This extensive effort involved more than 37 simultaneous investigations of historical allegations of child abuse, and coordination with law enforcement and child protective services agencies spanning more than five counties and several states. In addition, Ms. Smith has worked with the pharmaceutical industry to secure injunctions and contempt orders that have curtailed extremists tactics and have made clients, their employees, and, most importantly, their employees families feel more secure. She also works with relevant government agencies in these matters. Ms. Smith is a frequent lecturer on issues related to the institutional response to sexual misconduct, and has spoken at colleges and universities around the country, as well as at national conferences, including NACUA, the National Association of College and University Attorneys.

2 The parties have agreed, pursuant to Section of the Revised Regulations (1984) of the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 231, and The Commercial Arbitration Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 55 to submit this matter to Arbitration. The arbitration was held in Vancouver, BC over the course of 14 days between August and November 2009, and ultimately concluded on January 22, Written submissions were tendered by the parties, with the Claimant s reply submissions having been received on July 14, Introduction The Claimant, X ( the Claimant ) is a 70 year old lawyer who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on May 3, The Claimant alleges he has suffered a number of injuries, the most significant of which is a mild traumatic brain injury which continues to impair his ability to function and communicate. The Claimant submits that his cognitive limitations have robbed him of his ability to practice law, a career he enjoyed and by all accounts, one that personally defined him. This is an unusual case and not simple for the trier of fact. I say this, in part, because the Claimant is a senior lawyer whose practice has focused in the area of prosecuting personal injury actions stemming primarily from motor vehicle accidents. It is with this experience that the Claimant and his family have, either directly or indirectly, approached all matters stemming from the motor vehicle accident. The Claimant s Submissions 1. Claimant s counsel submits there is no dispute that the Claimant was functioning at a high level immediately before the Accident and that the evidence is clear that his level of function dropped dramatically after the Accident. Counsel for the Claimant repeated this proposition and suggested it to most of the witnesses that were called. 2. The Claimant seeks damages on the basis that he has suffered an MTBI that has had a severe effect on his life. He seeks income loss premised on the fact that but for the accident he would have continued to practice law for another five to ten years. 3. The Claimant says the temporal proximity of the accident to the sudden decline in function makes it clear the accident is the trigger behind the current low level of function. 4. With respect to MRI scan evidence, the Claimant submits the MRI scans of June 29, 2004 and November 5, 2008 are of little significance in this case as the findings neither prove nor disprove the existence of a mild traumatic brain injury. 1 P a g e
3 The Respondent s Submissions 5. The Respondent concedes that the Claimant sustained injuries in the accident but rejects the theory he is suffering from ongoing cognitive difficulties related to the accident which have resulted in his giving up the practice of law. 6. The Respondent submits the Claimant s medical evidence is flawed because it is founded on the proposition that because there is very little pre-accident medical information that one can conclude that the Claimant was in good health both physically and cognitively. 7. The Respondent suggests the Claimant was suffering from an undiagnosed underlying cognitive condition prior to the accident and states the Claimant s pre-accident work history and function is demonstrative of this. The Accident 8. On May 3, 2004, at approximately 12:15 p.m., the Claimant was driving westbound on Gatenbury Road in Port Moody. He was on his way home for lunch. The Claimant s vehicle was struck head-on by an older model Cadillac that had rolled eastbound downhill on Gatenbury Road after its uninsured driver had jumped out of it. 9. During his direct examination the Claimant said that he struck his head in the accident and that he lost consciousness. His first recollection after the accident, which he was able to describe in detail, was waking up and not realizing, I had been knocked unconscious, but I remember undoing my seatbelt and getting out of the car, but I did not remember the seatbelt coming off. As will be seen, the Claimant has not been consistent in reporting this history. 10. The Claimant also said that he did not remember the airbag in the vehicle deploying or the driver s side window breaking. 11. When the Claimant was asked during his direct examination if he knew how the driver s window had broken he testified, Nope, I do now. Because my head must have hit it. 12. The Claimant also said that at the scene of the accident he was attended to by a female bystander to whom he was able to provide his home telephone number and ask that she contact his wife so she could attend at the accident scene. 13. This female bystander, who had direct contact with the Claimant at the accident scene, was not called as a witness. 14. During his cross-examination the Claimant refused to admit having asked someone at the scene to call his wife despite having said so in his direct evidence. When this was put to him he said, I said it may have happened. I m not sure if it did or didn t. 15. In response, an Affidavit the Claimant swore on February 21, 2006, was put to him by Respondent s Counsel in which he deposed, 2 P a g e
4 After the accident I called my wife D and asked her to bring a video camera so that she could record the accident scene. I made it clear to her that I wanted the video of the accident to preserve the evidence for the purposes of using it in any lawsuit. My wife then attended the accident scene shortly thereafter and took the video of the accident scene on my request. The video was taken for the purpose of preserving the evidence of the accident scene to be used in any lawsuit that arose out of the accident. It was not done for the purposes of investigating the accident. 16. The Claimant agreed the contents of the Affidavit are true. 17. The Claimant s wife gave the following evidence about the day of the accident, I was home making lunch, and he had followed me home from the property, I got home maybe 10 minutes before him and I got a cell phone call from I believe it was the lady who was following him up the hill. I don t really know. She saw the accident. And I believe it was a stranger. I have no idea who she was, but she called me, and said your husband has been in an accident, and it was just down the hill, and he gave me your number. [emphasis added] 18. The Claimant s wife says she then, raced around the house, grabbed my camera and drove down the hill. She was unable to recall her conversation with her husband when she arrived on the scene except to say that he told her, I m fine. She says he was sitting in a lawn chair and he looked white as a ghost. She says he was stunned and that she was also stunned the accident happened. She set off to find out what happened. 19. The Claimant s wife was unable to say how long it took for the firefighters and ambulance to arrive at the accident scene. Various scene photographs were put to the Claimant s wife but she was unable to say if she took any or all of them. She was unable to recall the driver s side window of her husband s vehicle being broken at the accident scene, but then commented the pictures speak to the evidence. That is why I took pictures. 20. During cross-examination when asked what the purpose of recording the accident scene was the Claimant s wife said, You get the best evidence with pictures or video, because that is the initial presentation. People tend to make up stories. I didn t know what happened, so I went down there to find out what happened. 21. I ask her if the female who had called her had indicated whether or not her husband had been injured and she said no. She agreed that at the time of the call she had no idea about the status of her husband. I found this somewhat odd. It appeared from her direct evidence that she was more concerned at the time with finding her camera than the status of her husband. It could very well be that she did in fact speak to her husband as outlined below. 3 P a g e
5 22. During cross-examination an Affidavit sworn by the Claimant s wife on February 21, 2006, was put to her. In that Affidavit she deposed, on the day of the accident she received a telephone call from her husband indicating he had been in an accident nearby their home and asking her to bring a video camera so that she could record the accident scene; she attended the accident scene and took a video of the accident scene at the request of the Claimant for the purpose of preserving the evidence of the accident scene to be used in any lawsuit that arose out of the accident ; and the sole purpose of me making the video was to preserve the evidence for the anticipated lawsuit on the advice of my husband. [emphasis added] 23. When the inconsistencies between her evidence and the Affidavit were put to her, the Claimant s wife was vague, evasive and argumentative. When pressed by Respondent s Counsel and reminded she was under oath she said, If I signed that paper two years after the accident, then I would presume that would be closer to the truth, yes. She also admitted, I sometimes remember all kinds of things that aren t quite accurate, this is a day I don t want to remember. [emphasis added] 24. I found the inconsistencies in the evidence given by the Claimant and his wife at this hearing and the Affidavits they swore in this proceeding about the events that took place on the day of the accident more than a little troubling as it relates to their credibility. a) The Injuries 25. The Claimant s case is premised on the fact that he suffered a disabling brain injury in the accident. As an alternative, the Claimant suggests that he is suffering from an underlying degenerative process or neurological condition that has been triggered or accelerated by the accident. 26. The medical experts seem to agree that, while a loss of consciousness is not necessary for the diagnosis of a mild traumatic brain injury, some degree of altered consciousness must exist before the diagnosis of a mild traumatic brain injury can be made. How long the altered state of consciousness exists is also relevant to making such a diagnosis. 27. As I understand the evidence of the experts, which will be outlined below, there is a correlation between the initial severity of injury and eventual outcome such that most individuals with a mild traumatic brain injury go on to a full functional recovery. 4 P a g e
6 28. The medical experts also address the role of medical imaging such as MRI scans in assisting with the diagnosis of a mild traumatic brain injury. I take it however, from the evidence that even if such imaging is negative, that result does not rule out a brain injury as some findings can be too microscopic to show up and/or the imaging can be done at a time so far after the injury that findings may not show up. 29. The evidence also indicates that neuropsychological testing can be used to measure deficits in people with mild traumatic brain injuries or other processes that impact executive brain functioning. According to the experts, there are various factors that can influence these test results. 30. Dr. Cameron stated in one of his early opinions that he felt the Claimant was suffering from depression. Other examiners, such as Dr. Schmidt, did not find the Claimant endorsed a formal mood or anxiety disorder. As I understand the evidence given by Dr. Cameron, as well as that of Dr. Schmidt, Dr. LeBlanc and Dr. Semaru, depression and psychological problems can cause symptoms similar to those of a mild traumatic brain injury and further it is not uncommon for a person who suffers from a mild traumatic brain injury to develop depression. 31. Having regard to the above-noted objective measures, as imperfect as any one of them may be, I must examine the evidence tendered. b) The Evidence 32. No engineering evidence was called. The witness, who, according to the police file observed the accident events, was not called as a witness at this proceeding and so it is difficult for me to make any conclusion as to the severity of the impact simply based on the Claimant s assertion about the material damage involved. I note that the photographs tendered depict considerable front end damage to both vehicles. 33. An ambulance attended the accident scene and the paramedics noted the Claimant s chief complaints as being left wrist and knee pain. The paramedics also noted that the airbag in the Claimant s vehicle had deployed and that he was able to extricate himself from the vehicle by the time they arrived. 34. The paramedics found the Claimant to be alert and oriented. His Glasgow Coma score was noted to be 15/15. He denied any dizziness. 35. The Claimant was transported to Eagle Ridge Hospital where he reported the dynamics of the accident, the fact that the airbag had deployed and that he had not suffered a loss of consciousness. His Glasgow Coma Score was again recorded as being 15/15. On admission, the Claimant reported the gradual onset of neck pain, both knees, left wrist, upper back pain, right chest pain. 36. X-rays of the Claimant s chest and left wrist were ordered and were reported as being normal. An ECG was also done. 5 P a g e
7 37. There is no indication that the treating emergency physician was concerned about possible concussion or altered state of consciousness. His intake assessment described the Claimant as alert. There were no bruises, lacerations or contusions reported to the Claimant s head or face. 38. The nursing notes describe the Claimant as being steady on his feet and able to walk to the washroom unassisted. 39. The hospital discharge assessment was soft tissue injuries post MVC. On discharge the Claimant was not given any concussion or head injury precautions. He was advised to take Motrin and was given some Tylenol #3 and was told to take hours off work as he felt necessary. The Claimant s Experts Dr. Monks, GP 40. The next medical person to come into contact with the Claimant after the accident was Dr. B. Monks, who has been his family physician since According to Dr. Monks, he saw the Claimant six times between May 4 and December 6, At those visits the Claimant complained of feeling foggy and fatigued and not being mentally sharp or competent to manage his law practice. 42. Dr. Monks also said that he did not see the Claimant very often before the accident. He described his health as uneventful, except for obesity and high cholesterol. He described the Claimant as an impatient person. 43. In terms of the physical findings outlined in Dr. Monks report dated September 10, 2008, and which stems from his initial post accident visit with the Claimant, he noted the Claimant had contusions to his knees, his right hand and a hematoma over his abdomen. His findings include strain to the neck and back. No mention was made of any facial/head trauma. 44. Under cross-examination Dr. Monks admitted that on June 3, 2004, he wrote a note stating that the Claimant had suffered what appeared to be a mild concussion as a result of the motor vehicle accident and that his concentration and attention span were affected and that he fatigued easily and, as such, would not be able to resume work for a month. In that note Dr. Monks also stated his physical injuries are recovering at an average rate. 45. When asked why the note was written, Dr. Monks said it was because the Claimant s son requested it. 46. Dr. Monks admitted the contents of that note were based on the Claimant s self-reporting. It was entirely unclear as to why the Claimant s son needed such a note. The Claimant was self-employed and there was no evidence led that he required the note for Part VII or collateral disability benefits or other treatment. I infer the note was for litigation purposes. 6 P a g e
8 47. Under cross-examination Dr. Monks testified, Q A Q A Q A Q A And was it he, doctor, that advised you that he felt he couldn t practice law? He couldn t go back to practice law? Yes. And was he the one that told you he continues to be foggy in his concentration? Yes. And in fairness, doctor, is that which is it that which caused you to come to the conclusion that he might have suffered a minimal brain injury in this accident? Set aside the reports. I would think so, yes. Maybe I should add if I could, that he I also got the sense that he was a little foggy apart from what he told me. He didn t seem like himself. Can you expand on that? It s hard to put it in exact words, but he was different after the accident But to put an exact finger on it and say precisely what it was, I m not - just didn t seem quite his regular self. [emphasis added] 48. In his medical report and at this hearing Dr. Monks made no mention about having observed issues with the Claimant s balance, cognition or ability to communicate. 49. Dr. Monks did not see the Claimant that often before the accident and, in that same vein; he has really not followed his clinical course in any detail since. In fact, at the time Dr. Monks wrote his report in September 2008, he had not seen the Claimant since April 10, It is entirely unclear from the report if that clinical visit had anything to do with the alleged accident injuries. 50. I find that the diagnosis made by Dr. Monks in his September 2008 report of minor brain trauma as a result of this accident [with] some personal sequelae was based largely on the independent medical reports commissioned by Claimant s counsel and provided to him rather than his own examinations, observation and findings which were indeed very minimal. 51. I found Dr. Monks to be an honest and straightforward witness and, with respect, I take more from what he did not observe, record, or investigate as a physician than I do from the things he recorded and attributed to the Claimant himself. 7 P a g e
9 Dr. Cameron, Neurologist 52. On June 24, 2008, the Claimant saw an experienced neurologist, Dr. Cameron. 53. The Claimant said the appointment with Dr. Cameron was as a result of an appointment set up by my lawyer but then went on to say he thought he had dealt with the booking of Dr. Cameron directly. 54. With respect to the appointment with Dr. Cameron, the Claimant testified as follows during cross-examination: Q: And was it your view that as of the 24 th of June 2004 and to put that in context, less that two months after the accident, was it your view you had a brain injury? A: I thought I should have it checked out, and I had some of the best people I knew check it out. Q: You thought you should have it checked out? A: That s correct. Q: And because you still had in mind litigation arising out of this accident? A: Absolutely. As a trial lawyer and acting for plaintiffs and having dealt with ICBC in the past, I wanted to make sure that I had to tackle them right in order. Q: And part of getting your tackle in order was for you to seek out an opinion from Dr. Cameron within two months of the accident? A: I let him see me rather quickly after the accident. Q: To get your tackle in order? A: That s right to get to have everything in order; that s right. Q: You had a lot of confidence in Dr. Monks, did you not? A: I did. Q: Did it ever cross your mind to ask Dr. Monks for a referral to a neurologist? A: I don t recall what crossed my mind. 8 P a g e
10 Q: I see. But according to the records, you had seen Dr. Monks on four occasions before you saw Dr. Cameron? A: If that s what it says, that s what it says. Q: Okay. A: I think he recognized that I may have better contacts and better knowledge than he did. Q: You had better contacts in the medical world than Dr. Monks? A: In respect to this particular type of injury, yes. Q: I see. Because you had decided by June 24 th or sometime prior to that when you made the appointment that you sustained a brain injury; that is in your mind? A: I wanted to make sure that if I had one, I had the right people to deal with it. 55. At the June 24, 2004 visit to Dr. Cameron, the Claimant was able to explain the accident dynamics and stated his last recollection prior to the accident was seeing the vehicle coming towards him and his first recollection after the accident is being out of his vehicle and feeling dazed and confused. As will be seen below, this history is of critical importance to Dr. Cameron. 56. At that visit, the Claimant complained of feeling foggy, having problems with his memory and reduced concentration. He also complained about slurring when speaking, having word finding difficulties and difficulty with names. 57. Dr. Cameron s first neurological assessment was fairly unremarkable. The Claimant s gait, stance, balance and motor function were normal. No mention was made by Dr. Cameron at that assessment about his observing any problems with the Claimant s speech. I point this out because the evidence suggests that Dr. Cameron enjoyed a professional relationship with the Claimant in the years prior to the accident and, as such as with Dr. Monks, I would expect that he would notice if the Claimant presented in a manner that was alarmingly different to his pre-accident condition, especially with respect to his ability to ambulate and speak. 58. Dr. Cameron s opinion was that the Claimant did lose consciousness or suffer an altered state of consciousness at the scene of the accident and after the impact. Dr. Cameron s diagnosis was of post concussion syndrome. Dr. Cameron recommended an MRI of the Claimant s brain which was done on June 29, 2004, which showed white matter lesions in the frontal parietal lobes. 9 P a g e
11 59. Under cross-examination Dr. Cameron admitted he put a lot of weight on the history the Claimant provided to him stating, Unfortunately, we don t have video cameras in all the cars and on bicycles and patients who suffer head injuries and concussions, and you can t tell how long they re unconscious, and we re dependant on the history they provide us. [emphasis added] 60. According to Dr. Cameron, who did not see the MRI film but reviewed the radiologist s report, the MRI showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or hemosiderin deposition which he says can be present for up to two to four years following an intracranial hemorrhage or hemorrhagic contusion. Dr. Cameron s opinion is that it is probable the white matter lesions are due to the normal aging process and small vessel ischemic disease due to hardening of the arteries. He felt it is only possible that some of these lesions may be due to non hemorrhagic shear injury sustained at the time of the motor vehicle accident. [emphasis added] 61. Dr. Cameron s diagnosis was that the Claimant suffered a mild traumatic brain injury at the time of the accident and is suffering from ongoing cognitive deficits. 62. Dr. Cameron s prognosis was for improvement on the basis that patients tend to improve up to approximately two years following these types of injuries. He suggested that the Claimant be followed regularly by his family doctor and that neuropsychological testing be undertaken in six months if his condition did not improve. 63. On November 16, 2004, at the request of the Claimant s son, Dr. Cameron reassessed the Claimant. There is no reference to the specific neurological testing undertaken by Dr. Cameron at that visit. Again, there is no mention made by Dr. Cameron of his observing any problems with the Claimant s speech or communication style. Dr. Cameron noted the Claimant reported doing some administrative activities at work. 64. At that visit, the Claimant s wife told Dr. Cameron that the Claimant was more irritable and had mood swings much more than in the past. She also said the Claimant felt down, had negative feelings, memory problems and issues with his sleep. 65. It appears that based on those interviews Dr. Cameron came to the conclusions the Claimant was significantly disabled and competitively unemployable as a result of ongoing cognitive problems and probable associated psychological problems. Dr. Cameron again recommended neuropsychological testing and evaluation by a psychiatrist. 66. The Claimant next saw Dr. Cameron in September At that time, he noted complaints of intermittent insomnia, pain in both knees and right wrist. Symptoms of depression were recorded. Referral to a psychiatrist or psychologist was recommended. Dr. Cameron also suggested the Claimant be reassessed by a psychiatrist and neurologist when he was two years post-accident. 10 P a g e
12 67. In November 2006, the Claimant returned to Dr. Cameron for a third assessment. Dr. Cameron noted minimum improvement. Once again no mention is made by Dr. Cameron about his observing the Claimant as suffering from any issues with his speech, gait or balance. 68. The Claimant told Dr. Cameron of his ongoing problems with his memory, attention span and concentration. He told him his irritability and mood swings had improved but not resolved and he still felt depressed. Again, he described going to the office to do administrative work on a part-time basis and managing the construction of his home. 69. Dr. Cameron s final assessment was on March 20, Dr. Cameron s examination, while not terribly remarkable, did demonstrate some changes in the Claimant s short term memory as compared to his previous assessments. Dr. Cameron concluded the Claimant will be completely disabled and not competitively employable permanently in the future principally due to cognitive dysfunction and in part due to psychological dysfunctions that he has suffered as a result of the injuries sustained at the time of the motor vehicle accident. The report does not address what these psychological dysfunctions might be. Dr. N. Stewart, Physiatrist 70. On September 29, 2004, the Claimant attended an assessment with Dr. N. Stewart, Physiatrist. At the time of that assessment the Claimant reported that there had been no change in his balance or coordination since the accident. He told her he could not say if he struck his head, although the side window of his car was broken. He told her that he had no bumps or bruises on his head after the accident. 71. The Claimant told Dr. Stewart that he had not suffered from neck, back pain or headaches since the accident. He felt he had to use the handrail when going down stairs. It was not clear if that was because of bilateral knee complaints since the accident. 72. The Claimant advised Dr. Stewart that he had issues with fatigue after the accident but that his energy level had improved over time. He also complained of difficulties with his speech since the motor vehicle accident, like word finding, as well as problems with his memory, slower thinking and being easily frustrated. 73. Dr. Stewart conducted a collateral interview with the Claimant s wife. She reported the Claimant had difficulty answering questions and would use the wrong words. She also reported issues with his mood and increased outbursts of anger. At that visit, the Claimant s wife was of the view his career was over due to his injuries. 74. Dr. Stewart s physical examination was relatively unremarkable. Examination of the Claimant s knees was normal, as was his gait. Dr. Stewart noted the Claimant appeared disheveled after getting dressed following the examination. 75. Dr. Stewart s opinion was that because of the impaired level of consciousness reported by the Claimant and observed by his wife after the accident and the changes in his memory, thinking and emotional state, that he likely suffered a mild traumatic brain injury. She 11 P a g e
13 recommended a neuropsychological assessment be undertaken. She also suggested speech therapy to help with his language skills. 76. On December 11, 2006, the Claimant returned to Dr. Stewart. At that time, the Claimant reported continued improvement with his physical symptoms, although he felt they had reached a plateau and that he felt his energy level was going down slightly. He reported continued problems with his memory and concentration. He described his mood as being a little more calm. He said the physiotherapy for his knees was helpful. 77. The Claimant told Dr. Stewart that while he had been to court a couple of times on pretty straight forward matters, that his son was now running his former law practice. He also said that he provided advice to the lawyers at his son s office in areas where he is probably more knowledgeable than any other lawyer in the province. 78. The Claimant also advised Dr. Stewart that he remained involved in the design and coordination of building a new house and in conducting computer research. 79. Again, Dr. Stewart s physical examination was relatively unremarkable. No problems with gait or range of motion were noted. Dr. Stewart opined, the physical injuries have largely resolved. 80. The Claimant s final independent assessment with Dr. Stewart was on June 11, At the time of that assessment the Claimant reported he, no longer has a problem with pain in his knees and pain in the left wrist, although he prefaced this by saying he did not use these areas that often because he did not want to push things. 81. In Dr. Stewart s report dated June 23, 2008, she again referenced the Claimant as reporting ongoing problems with memory and concentration. She also indicated that at her final visit that the Claimant reported difficulty writing and printing. She also noted the Claimant s speech was somewhat slurred. Dr. J. Schmidt, Neuropsychologist 82. In December 2004, the Claimant was seen by Dr. J. Schmidt, Neuropsychologist. Dr. Schmidt was provided with a number of documents to review but was not given the post accident ambulance crew report or hospital records. 83. Dr. Schmidt s view is that the Claimant suffered an altered state of consciousness for a period of seconds to a minute after the accident. 84. No mention is made by Dr. Schmidt of his having observed the Claimant to be suffering from any problems with his speech, gait or balance when he saw him. 85. Dr. Schmidt concluded based on the history he was given, the Claimant was a well functioning individual prior to the accident and that he most likely suffered a mild traumatic brain injury which resulted in a constellation of cognitive and emotional problems as a result of the accident. 12 P a g e
14 86. With respect to the testing undertaken by Dr. Schmidt, there was no evidence of generalized mental slowing. The Claimant showed some weakness, although his scoring was in the 61 st percentile in testing for focused, divided and sustained attention. 87. Dr. Schmidt indicated his testing did raise the possibility of attention deficit disorder. In terms of executive function, Dr. Schmidt s testing revealed subtle weaknesses in problem solving. The Claimant had generalized difficulty with learning verbal and visual information. The Claimant s verbal comprehension was in the 91 st percentile but he did have problems with word finding and letter fluency. Dr. Schmidt found the language functioning and generalized deficits a striking finding given his educational and vocabulary history. 88. Dr. Schmidt opined that the Claimant s age is a significant factor when it comes to addressing the effects of his injury as brain injury in older adults raises the three issues that warrant further discussion including: Brain injury in older adults (especially those over 60) produces more significant cognitive and psychological effects; Older adults are at risk for age related cognitive disorders, most notably dementia; That even with normal aging there is some decline in cognitive performance which might lead to low scores on tests simply reflecting the aging process. 89. While Dr. Schmidt felt the Claimant s testing was consistent with a mild traumatic brain injury he did caution that because of the results of the CT scan of the Claimant s brain he may have a concurrent neurological condition which could interact with the effects of the head injury to intensify the symptoms. Dr. Schmidt said the history he was given suggested the onset of symptoms was sudden after the accident; given that circumstances and the problems could not be related exclusively to an underlying neurological condition. 90. Dr. Schmidt also opined that further recovery could occur. He recommended further testing in months. 91. In October 2006, Dr. Schmidt conducted a second evaluation of the Claimant. The Claimant reported doing administrative tasks at work but he said he was spending most of his time trying to finish the construction of his house. This included dealing with some legal issues involving the Municipality. The Claimant reported problems with printing and handwriting. Cognitive testing was unchanged. At that time, Dr. Schmidt felt the Claimant was not depressed. 92. Dr. Schmidt undertook a third assessment on April 16, Dr. Schmidt s testing showed continued difficulty with focusing, sustaining and shifting attention and with learning and retaining information. There were slightly weaker scores on a test asking him to learn and remember a story than in previous testing. There was slight improvement in 13 P a g e
15 word learning testing. 93. Dr. Schmidt opined the Claimant s situation had reached a plateau and that he would not experience a great deal of improvement or deterioration in cognitive functioning in the future. Janice Landy, OT 94. On June 29, 2008, the Claimant was seen by Janice Landy, Occupational Therapist, for the purposes of a Life Care/Cost of Future Care Plan. The report was based on meetings Ms. Landy had with the Claimant, his wife and son in May 2005 and June Ms. Landy s opinion is that because of, The diagnosed mild traumatic brain injury sustained and the constellation of symptoms which emerged immediately post injury cognitively, behaviorally, physically and emotionally and which continued to the present time have dramatically impacted [the Claimant s] abilities for independence in his personal, safety, emotional and social wellbeing. He will require continuous support to overcome the barriers to facilitate participation at a personal and societal level and provide the least restrictive environment possible. 96. Included with Ms. Landy s recommendations are the following: a) One-To-One Rehabilitation Support Worker on a day-to-day basis; b) In-Home Support 20 hours a week; c) Speech and Language Therapy; d) Physical Activation Program; e) Psychological Consultation; f) Transportation Assistance; g) A Rehabilitation Case Manager; and h) Financial Management. The Respondent s Experts Dr. J. LeBlanc, Neuropsychologist 97. At the request of the Respondent, the Claimant saw Dr. J. LeBlanc, Neuropsychologist on August 27, When Dr. LeBlanc first asked the Claimant about the accident he declined to answer stating it is in my records. I note from the other reports produced, it does not appear the Claimant had any difficulty discussing the dynamics of the accident with Dr. Monks, Dr. Cameron or Dr. Schmidt and so the response is suspect. I am not sure whether this obstinacy is part of his litigation strategy as it certainly was not lack of memory because 14 P a g e
16 with some prompting he did provide Dr. LeBlanc with the accident details. 99. According to Dr. LeBlanc, He was then hit head-on by a driver-less vehicle after its driver jumped out of it. At the time of the accident, [the Claimant s] airbag was deployed he reports that he didn t realize that it had done so.he states his last memory prior to the accident was seeing the vehicle smash into his car. His next memory was taking off his seatbelt and leaving his automobile. [The Claimant] reports injuries sustained at the time included a mark over his waist from the seatbelt, feeling dizzy and dazed, and later being aware his knee hurt ( I think it was my left knee ) He states that he can t recall, but either he or someone else contacted the police, and he also called his wife Dr. LeBlanc noted that at the time of the assessment, he continues to experience fatigue (which has improved over the past few months), decreased concentration, memory difficulties ( I mix up my kids names I can t recall information unless given cues ), and a tendency to mix up words and have poor enunciation.he was then questioned more specifically, and noted that his handwriting has dropped badly, that problem solving is still pretty good but it takes longer The Claimant s wife told Dr. LeBlanc, he tends to ask her to remember information for him now, and that his conversations can seem scattered and disconnected. She feels his concentration has improved...[the Claimant s wife] finds that she sometimes needs to prompt [the Claimant] to groom himself as he will not do so on his own She states he is able to manage his finances adequately, and that he is mortified of making mistakes in this area Dr. LeBlanc s opinion was that the Claimant did not put forth full effort when his memory was being tested. She noted, Measures of validity and effort, as well as consistency between tests reflected varying degrees of performance, with clear indicators of less than optimal effort. As a consequence, [the Claimant s] neuropsychological test results are of questionable validity. More specifically, on a measure of memory, effort scores on this measure indicate that there is a very high likelihood that [the Claimant] did not put forth full effort. On this measure, which is insensitive to severe brain injury but which is greatly affected by effort, [the Claimant s] scores were so low as to indicate incomplete effort, and thus doubtful validity of test results To put [the Claimant s] memory abilities in context on this measure, his scores were lower than patients with brain injuries who had Glasgow Coma Scale Scores of 9.6, the scores of children in clinical samples, and 15 P a g e
17 those of documented neurological patients. The developer of the test noted that scores less than 70% on one subtest or less than 60% on another subtest would be very suspicious except in someone with dementia (in need of supervision) or profound amnesia. ([The Claimant] scored 50% on the former subtest and 40% on the latter when having to make associations with the words thus 20% less than the cut-off on both measures).... On another measure of memory and list-learning [the Claimant s] performance reflected significantly low level of ability in four out of four areas. This low level of performance is suggestive of poor effort. For example, on a test of recognition [the Claimant] endorsed new or incorrect words at a high level, rejecting words he had previously been given significantly below a chance level. It is also notable that [the Claimant s] results on this measure indicates that he has a pronounced tendency to intrude incorrect information (or confabulate) into his recall; however, this tendency was not evidence on any other measures of memory a very unusual finding. He also did not demonstrate improved performance in paradigms which are usually helpful for those with traumatic brain injury performing much lower than average. Invalid performance was evidenced on personality testing, as well. On the Personality Assessment Inventory, [the Claimant] appeared to attempt to present himself as exceptionally free of the common shortcomings or difficulties most people experience. He did so to such a degree that the validity of his scores on this measure are highly questionable and unable to be interpreted. [emphasis added] 103. The results of Dr. LeBlanc s testing were invalid due to the Claimant s less than optimal effort On May 1, 2008, the Claimant returned to Dr. LeBlanc. The Claimant s wife also attended the appointment but refused to provide any collateral information stating that she was told not to say anything, which is curious given her participation in prior assessments arranged on the Claimant s behalf At this second assessment the Claimant provided greater effort and Dr. LeBlanc considered the results of the testing to be valid Dr. LeBlanc s opinion was that the medical records, the Claimant s reporting and test data supported a diagnosis of dementia rather than a persistent post-concussive disorder. She opined, When examining the neuropsychological test performance of [the Claimant] over the course of four assessments during the past four years 16 P a g e
18 (two from Dr. Schmidt), it is clear that [the Claimant] is performing at a more impaired level from a neuropsychological standpoint now than in 2004, in a number of areas associated with Alzheimer s Disease. This finding is despite the fact that test scores may have been artificially low due to lack of effort in his July 2006 evaluation with this clinician. In other words, [the Claimant s] current valid neuropsychological test performance is actually weaker than his previous testing (which appeared to be overly negative due to lack of effort). Thus this, indeed, represents a notable decline in skills. [emphasis added] 107. Dr. LeBlanc outlined various neuropsychological indicators of dementia present in the Claimant s testing and also clinical symptoms recorded consistent with cortical dementia but inconsistent with a mild traumatic brain injury including: Slurring of words or dysarthria; Changes in sleep patterns; Being short tempered; Being disconnected in conversation; Decreased ability to perform basic activities of daily living such as grooming and dressing; Weakness in attention, problem-solving and organizational ability; Mixing up words and concepts; Personality changes, i.e. inappropriate behavior in social settings; Persevering or overly focusing on details; Problems with handwriting and printing very uncommon with mild brain injury; and Progression of symptoms over time Dr. LeBlanc admitted the problems reported by the Claimant immediately after the accident, including complaints of fatigue, dizziness and decreased attention were consistent with a concussion, making it possible he did suffer a concussion at the time of the accident. Dr. LeBlanc also pointed out that the pattern of recovery for concussion is one in which the symptoms lessen to a significant degree (or fully remit) within three to twelve months post injury Dr. LeBlanc opined that the medical records since the accident are much more consistent with dementia due to the increased symptoms over time and his decreased ability to perform activities of daily living, as well as the neuropsychological symptoms reported that are inconsistent with a post-concussive disorder Dr. LeBlanc further indicated the accident did not initiate, aggravate or hasten the neuropsychological decline the Claimant has been experiencing and that he would have demonstrated the same constellation of neuropsychological weaknesses in the absence of the accident occurring. 17 P a g e
19 111. Dr. LeBlanc opined, [the Claimant] does not have accident-related symptoms, from a neuropsychological perspective, thus there is no indication that his current difficulties related to his ability to work as a lawyer is due to the accident in question, in any capacity. Instead, the deficits in his ability to work as a lawyer appear due to a preexisting cortical type dementia, which has worsened over time Dr. LeBlanc testified that the medical literature indicates that a onetime concussion does not cause the onset of dementia In her report and at this hearing, Dr. LeBlanc and other experts, including Dr. Schmidt, explained that dementing processes begin very gradually. Dr. LeBlanc also explained it is not unusual for families to be unaware of acquired deficits associated with dementing processes until there is a sudden disruption in someone s routine which results in the person being disoriented, confused and unable to cope with a situation Dr. LeBlanc is of the view that the motor vehicle accident served as such a situation and so while the accident did not cause the neuropsychological symptoms, it served to highlight the Claimant s pre-existing deficits in cognition and his functional inability to cope with the situation. Dr. S. Semrau, Psychiatrist 115. On October 31, 2006, the Claimant attended Dr. S. Semrau, Psychiatrist. Dr. Semrau s opinion was that there was no physical evidence the Claimant suffered a concussion or mild traumatic brain injury in the accident. Dr. Semaru stated that if there was a head injury then it would have been extremely mild and would have fully resolved very rapidly Dr. Semrau noted, There is no history of pre-accident complaints of memory-cognitive symptoms leading up to this MVA (see pre-accident history opinion page 4). However, it is very common that neither the patient nor others they are in contact with tend to readily observe or take specific note of relatively mild signs of memory/cognitive dysfunction, particularly in older people. Given that [the Claimant] himself appears to be a very proud man, it s particularly unlikely that he would have been able to develop awareness or insight into such symptoms himself, probably tending to ignore them or put them down to other causes such as simple aging or tiredness from long hours of work. Thus the lack of pre-mva history of memory/cognitive symptoms is not a particularly reliable basis for concluding that none were present Dr. Semrau did not find the Claimant suffered from driving anxiety or posttraumatic stress symptoms since the accident With respect to any possible post accident mood disorders, Dr. Semrau found there were some isolated indications of early depression in the clinical records and that the Claimant reported to him initially feeling frustrated, irritable and that he lacked patience but that 18 P a g e
20 those symptoms had improved. The Claimant denied feeling significantly depressed since the accident but acknowledged he had to face the reality he could not practice law, stating he has taken the can t cry over spilt milk approach to dealing with this Like others, Dr. Semrau felt the progress of the Claimant s symptoms with his memory, concentration and issues with speech stood in contrast to the usual pattern of recovery experienced by people who suffer mild traumatic brain injuries. According to Dr. Semrau these people typically show gradual or complete recovery over roughly the first two years post injury followed by a plateau phase Dr. Semrau did not find the Claimant to be in need of psychiatric treatment except in relation to whatever dementia or other such illness is causing his mental functioning problems, as well as to assist his own and his family s adaptation to his difficulties. Dr. A. Prout, Neurologist 121. On June 2, 2008, the Claimant attended Dr. A. Alistair J.E. Prout, Neurologist. According to Dr. Prout s report, he has recollection of the events leading up to the accident and there is no suggestion of retrograde amnesia. The history provided to me on June 2, 2008 suggests that [the Claimant] may have been briefly unaware (likely for a period of seconds) immediately following the impact at the time of the accident but he appears to recall the actual impact. It appears that the only period of the accident that is not recalled by [the Claimant] is the actual deployment of the airbag and possibly the few seconds thereafter. He has provided history to me and to other examiners suggesting that he recalls being in the vehicle immediately after the accident and he recalls taking his seatbelt off. In my opinion he does not have a period of posttraumatic amnesia beyond the initial moments after the impact of the accident. In my opinion the period of possible posttraumatic amnesia has been exaggerated by certain examiners including Drs. Cameron and Stewart. The records reviewed and the history provided to myself and to Dr. Schmidt in particular did not suggest that [the Claimant] had posttraumatic amnesia lasting for several hours (as was the opinion of Dr. Cameron) or possibly several days (according to the report of Dr. Stewart) Dr. Prout s opinion is that it is unclear whether the Claimant suffered a very mild traumatic brain injury or even a concussion in the motor vehicle accident. Dr. Prout bases this on the fact the Claimant did not report the typical symptoms reported with a concussion such as significant dizziness, photophobia or headaches. Dr. Prout indicated that the Claimant s reported feelings of being foggy and tired could be related to the physical pain he experienced in the immediate aftermath of the accident Dr. Prout also found the symptoms reported by the Claimant atypical for the expected course following a traumatic brain injury or concussion. Specifically, Dr. Prout noted the 19 P a g e

1 Psychology Graduate Program Bylaws Administrative Home: Department of Psychology Revised: May 2006; September 2009 Graduate Council s Approval Date: November 2, 2009 ARTICLE I: OBJECTIVE A. Degrees Offered The Graduate Program in Psychology (hereafter referred to as the Program) offers a Ph.D. degree. Although students in the program have the option of obtaining an M.A. degree en route to the Ph.D., students are admitted to the graduate program only if they plan to obtain a Ph.D. degree. B. Discipline The Program encompasses the broad field of psychology and its interactions with related disciplines. Resources and faculty are concentrated in five areas: Psychobiology, Developmental Psychology, Social & Personality Psychology, Quantitative Psychology, and Perception, Cognition & Cognitive Neuroscience. Each member of the Program is affiliated with one or more of these Areas. B. Mission of the Program The Program is organized primarily to foster and administer graduate teaching and research leading to the Ph.D. in Psychology, in conformity with the policies and procedures of the Graduate Council and the Office of Graduate Studies of the Davis campus of the University of California. The Program also fosters collaborative psychology-related research activities, promotes interactions among researchers in psychology and related disciplines, sponsors intellectual interchanges between local researchers and members of the international scientific community, and represents the interests of psychology researchers collectively to the University administration and other internal and external groups.
2 ARTICLE II: MEMBERSHIP A. Criteria for Membership in the Program The Program faculty shall consist of the ladder faculty of the Department of Psychology and the adjunct faculty of the Department of Psychology (hereafter conjointly referred to as the Psychology Faculty). The Program faculty shall also consist of UC Davis faculty who meet the following criteria: (1) Hold an appropriate academic title as (a) a member of the Academic Senate, (b) Adjunct Professor, (c) Lecturer (without Security of Employment) or (d) Lecturer Without Salary. Academic staff with primary appointments as Cooperative Extension Specialists or in the Professional Research series are not eligible to be members unless they also hold an appropriate instructional title (normally Lecturer Without Salary). (2) Be qualified to serve as primary research supervisor for candidates for the Ph.D. degree in Psychology, with an active, substantial, and independent program of research in Psychology or a related area. (3) Be approved by a majority vote of the current Program faculty. Voting Rights: All members of the Program Faculty will be eligible to vote on graduate student admissions decisions, changes in graduate program requirements, changes in bylaws, student committee composition, and any other matters pertaining to education and training in the Program. However, elected members will not have voting rights regarding other Psychology Department matters, such as department personnel actions, department budget decisions, or undergraduate program matters. B. Application for Membership All ladder and adjunct members of the Department of Psychology are automatically members and need not apply. Other faculty who wish to join the Program may self-nominate or be nominated by an existing member of the Program. Members are expected to serve willingly in the administration of the Program and on committees for the Program. The applicant must also agree to participate actively in Program activities directed toward graduate education and training (see II.D for specifics). 2
3 Nominees will submit a cover letter and CV to the Graduate Adviser. These materials will be reviewed by the Executive Committee and by the faculty of the relevant Area of the Program, along with additional materials as determined to be necessary (e.g., the nominee may be asked to give a research presentation to the Area). If the Executive Committee and Area faculty find that the nominee meets the requirements set forth in Article II.A, the nominee s materials and a brief summary by the relevant Area Head will be provided to the full Program Faculty, who will then vote on membership. The final decision will be based on a majority of those voting. Election to the Program Faculty is for a period of three years. Membership will terminate automatically at the end of the three year period unless the member requests an extension. The term may be extended for three more years by a vote of the Program Faculty based on the procedure described in II.D below. If a member s faculty appointment at Davis ends before the term of membership expires, membership will terminate automatically. C. Emeritus Status Emeritus faculty members may become members of the Program Faculty by a majority vote of the current Program faculty, but they are not members automatically by virtue of having been members before retirement. Emeritus faculty members hold all the rights and responsibilities of any other members of the Program Faculty. D. Review of Membership Membership for elected members must be renewed every three years, with onethird of the elected members reviewed each year. The Graduate Adviser or appointed staff member shall initiate this review by sending, during the Fall Quarter, a questionnaire to each member scheduled for review. The response to this questionnaire will be reviewed by the Executive Committee and the Program Faculty, who will then decide on the basis of a majority vote whether to extend membership for another threeyear term. Continued membership in the Graduate Faculty will be based on active participation in the Program, to be judged based on the following kinds of activities: 3
4 (1) Taking an active role in administering the Program by serving on an administrative committee, as Graduate Adviser, or as an administrative officer of the Program. (2) Providing graduate-level instruction in psychology or closely related fields. (3) Serving on individual advising committees, qualifying examination committees, and dissertation committees of students in the Program. A faculty member will be considered to have resigned from the Program under the following circumstances: (1) A written letter of resignation is sent to the Chair of the Program. (2) Resignation from the faculty of the University. (3) Failure to return two consecutive questionnaires sent within one year while the member is in residence. E. Membership Appeal Process Denial of membership may be appealed in writing to the Chair of the Program. The appeal will be discussed in a meeting of the Executive Committee and then in a meeting of the Program Faculty. The individual may attend a portion of these meetings if this is agreeable to all parties. The final decision will be based on a majority vote of the Program Faculty. Individuals who are denied membership or renewal of membership may make a final appeal to the Dean of Graduate Studies. ARTICLE III: ADMINISTRATION The administration of the Program and its activities will be vested in an Executive Committee, chaired by the Program Chair. 4
5 ARTICLE IV: GRADUATE PROGRAM CHAIR A. Chair Appointment Process The Chair of the Psychology Department shall serve as Chair of the Program. B. Duties of the Chair The Chair shall be the chief officer and spokesperson for the Program and for the Executive Committee. The Chair shall call and preside over meetings of these bodies, shall appoint standing committees and ad hoc committees, and shall serve as liaison between the Program and other groups within and outside the University. The Chair is responsible for developing and implementing policies for the program, coordinating all administrative matters with the Office of Graduate Studies, managing the budgets of the program, coordinating the program s graduate course teaching assignments with the relevant department chairs, and nominating graduate advisers for appointment. The Chair may delegate the day-to-day responsibilities to the Graduate Adviser. However, even with the delegation of day-to-day responsibilities, the Chair is the official, graduate program Chair. ARTICLE V COMMITTEES A. Executive Committee The Executive Committee shall consist of the Psychology Department s Area Heads, the Graduate Adviser, and the Program Chair (who serves as Chair of the Executive Committee). The Executive Committee will oversee the operation of the Program and make advisory statements to the Program Faculty regarding membership applications and renewals. B. Graduate Curriculum Committee The Graduate Curriculum Committee shall consist of three Program Faculty appointed by the Department Chair and a student representative selected by the department s graduate student organization. The student will be a non-voting member of 5
6 the committee. Committee members generally serve for one year, but may be reappointed, with their consent, by the Program Chair. The function of the Graduate Curriculum Committee will be to advise the Program Chair, Graduate Adviser, and Program Faculty concerning matters of curriculum and requirements for the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees. Changes in the M.A. and Ph.D. requirements must be approved at a general meeting of the Program Faculty and by Graduate Council. C. Admissions/Fellowships Committee The Admissions/Fellowships Committee shall consist of the Area Heads, who are elected by faculty members in their Areas, along with the Graduate Adviser, who will chair the committee. Area Heads are elected for three-year terms by faculty members in their Areas; an Area Head who is reelected for an additional term would automatically continue to serve on the Admissions/Fellowships Committee. Recommendations for graduate student admissions shall be made by the appropriate Area Head, with input from the students and faculty in the Area. These recommendations will be reviewed within each Area and then subjected to a vote of the Program Faculty. Recommendations for new and continuing student fellowships are also made by this committee, with the assistance of the faculty within each Area. ARTICLE VI: STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES The Department Chair, upon recommendation of the Program s graduate student organization, appoints student representatives to the curriculum committee. Student members of committees do not have voting rights. The student members will be invited to attend the annual meeting of the program, when the agenda includes items relevant to the committees for which they serve as student representatives. The chair of any committee with student members and the program chair or graduate advisor for the annual meeting must excuse the student representatives from meetings during discussions of other students, personnel actions or disciplinary issues relating to faculty, during rankings of existing students for funding, and for disciplinary issues related to students. 6
7 ARTICLE VII: GRADUATE ADVISER A Graduate Adviser, who must be a member of the Graduate Faculty, will be recommended for appointment by the Program Chair in compliance with the policies and procedures of the Graduate Council and the Office of Graduate Studies. The faculty member who is serving as Graduate Adviser works closely with the staff person in charge of graduate matters, who is also likely to hold the job for a long period and be familiar with applicable rules and policies. Individual student advising is primarily accomplished by an Individual Advising Committee (IAC), composed of three members of the Graduate Program. The Chair of each student s IAC is the student s primary mentor and will supervise most of his or her research progress. The IAC, in annual meetings and regular individual contact, keeps track of the progress of the student and provides advice on how the student may best complete the requirements of the Program. Each student s IAC is created in consultation with the Graduate Adviser. The Graduate Adviser must approve the IAC composition including any changes to membership due, for example, to a faculty member leaving the University or a change in the student s direction of work. Each IAC reports to the Graduate Adviser, who as a member of the Executive Committee, reports student progress, problems, etc. to that group. The Graduate Adviser s function will also include approval of preliminary and qualifying examination committees; preparation of recommendations for Teaching Assistant employment and class assignments; advising of graduate students on their academic programs; determination that each student meets the Program s academic requirements; and approval of student petitions for exceptions to the Program s requirements. The Graduate Adviser will serve on the Executive Committee and will serve as Chair of the Admissions/Fellowships Committee. ARTICLE VIII: MEETINGS Meetings will be held regularly in conjunction with faculty meetings of the Department of Psychology. Any member of the graduate program can request that a meeting be scheduled by contacting the chair, who will then poll program members to see if they agree with the request. If five or more members agree, a meeting will be 7
8 scheduled. In addition, a meeting solely devoted to the Program will be held each Spring Quarter, and all Program Faculty members in residence will be expected to attend this meeting. Notice of meetings will be distributed to all Graduate Faculty at least two days prior to the meeting, and agenda items must be solicited. Minutes of meetings shall be made available to the Program Faculty within ten days following the meeting. If a Program Faculty member is unable to attend a scheduled meeting, he or she may submit comments about the agenda to the chair prior to the meeting. The chair will communicate these comments to the Program Faculty in attendance at the meeting. ARTICLE IX: QUORUM A quorum for the purpose of modifying bylaws or establishing Program policy must be greater than 50% of Program faculty members who are eligible to vote, exclusive of those on leave. Passage of proposals will require a minimum of more than 50% of the members who actually vote. Balloting may be done either in a meeting of the Program Faculty or via an electronic voting system. ARTICLE X: AMENDMENTS Any proposals for amendments of these bylaws will be circulated to the Program Faculty via and discussed in a meeting of the Program Faculty. Approval requires the standard quorum as defined in Article IX and a two-thirds majority of those voting in an electronic ballot. At least one week shall pass between distribution of a proposal and the commencement of voting. All amendments and revisions must be submitted to Graduate Council for review and approval. 8

My wife says these look like the Martian skies in an old pulp paperback cover. Just one idea for how you can use these high-res textures in your projects.
This is a post from the old blog, but I want to preserve it in the current lab. I still talk about it with Fred occasionally, so you never know when I'll pick it up again.
A while back, Fred Hicks wrote up this cool idea where superpowers came from a mysterious radio signal. Certain people are "Receivers" for this signal and are regulated by the FCC.
We talked about incorporating a bit of HAM radio jargon. Specifically the phrase "5 by 5," meaning that a radio signal has perfect signal strength ("5") and perfect signal clarity("5").
The natural systemic representation for this would be a 2d6 system, wherein one die represents signal strength and the other signal clarity. "6" results would be special cases, representing some kind of critical-something-or-other.
I woke up with further thoughts on how to express this as a superpower. Of course, these re-tread some other ideas I've used in Do and Happy Birthday Robot, but I beg indulgence one more time. :P
I'm imagining Receivers as radio-powered analogues to the Marauders. Swirling balls of reality-bending chaos that must be contained or destroyed for the sake of universal coherence. With that in mind, here's my idea for how to handle radio-powers:
On your turn, if you choose to use a radio power, first roll two six-sided dice. One die represents signal strength. One die represents signal clarity. Those designations are decided at the beginning of the game.
You may describe some amazing feat of radio-powered reality-bending, but your description is limited. You may only describe this event in a number of words equal to your Strength die result, to a maximum of 5. (Results of "6" are discussed after these steps.)
You always have the word "I" as a free word, though. Saying "I," in your description does not count against this word limit.
For example: You rolled a "3" on your strength die. That means you could say something like the following sentences:
Here's where things get tricky. Now your description will be modified based on the result on your Clarity die.
Oh wait, I just realized a problem here. My original idea was to make each player take turns changing one word in the description. The number of turns would be determined by the Clarity die. So if you rolled a 4, then four players would each take a turn changing one word of your description.
The idea was that radio powers are unpredictable and dangerous, sometimes causing unintended events.
But that doesn't fit the "5 by 5" theme if a higher number is supposed to be a clearer signal. Oh well, you see where I was going with it. :P
Oh yeah, and the idea for 6s is that they give you "Amps," You can put an amp on a word in your description so that it may not be changed.
"Always one step behind" idea: 1st Turn: Choose card, place face-down. 2nd Turn, and on: Choose, place again. Then reveal prev turn's card.
Whenever I toss out a little idea like that on Twitter, it's a fast way to find out if that mechanic has been used elsewhere. Turns out this one is the central mechanic of the Killer Bunnies franchise. It's also present in the 1960s game Nuclear War and more recent game Wings of War.
Gosh, that's a rather blood-soaked legacy for this mechanic. I wonder if there is a way we can take it somewhere less violent. I've got variable values on my mind this week, so let's start there with a little parlor game. I'm popping this into the Boardroomers February Game Design Contest as well. I call it...
Okay, I'm a day late for a Valentine's themed game, but the them is pretty loose anyway. This game is inspired by wistful romantics plucking flower petals while muttering "he loves me, he loves me not."
In this game, players will take two cards, accepting one into a tableau and discarding the other into their own discard pile. Scores are based on suits in tableau multiplied by suits in the discard pile, so choose wisely!
The deck is comprised of 2-5 and J of each suit in a standard playing card deck, for a total deck of 20 cards. You also need three cubes, which are used to note the winner of each match.
2) Choose one and say "he loves me." Place this neatly in front of you face-down. This is the start of your TABLEAU.
3) Place the other card haphazardly face-down to your side and say "he loves me not." This is the start of your PILE.
NEXT TURN, AND THEREAFTER: Repeat as above. Additionally, reveal your chosen tableau card from the previous turn.
FINAL TURN: Repeat as above. Additionally, both players reveal their final chosen tableau card simultaneously and reveal their discard piles.
So, if you had two hearts in your tableau and two hearts in your discard pile, you'd score four points from hearts. Repeat this for diamonds, clubs and spades.
So, if you had a Jack of spades in your tableau and your opponent had three spades in his discard pile, you would score 3 points from this jack. Repeat for each face card in your tableau, even if they're part of the same suit.

Arts to end violence gallery show celebrates the power of art as a tool for social change! - Neighbors in Action
Posted In anti-gun violence, anti-violence, Arts to End Violence, community art, community event, Crown Heights, Events, families, S.O.S., Safe and Healthy Community, youth
On Thursday May 19 we celebrated our 6th annual Arts to End Violence Gallery Opening! Over 150 people gathered at Ron Taylor Gallery to view work created by youth and professional artists around themes of non-violence, community building, trauma, healing, and peace.
When they weren’t looking at the artwork, those in attendance could head next door to Greater Restoration Baptist Church to eat and debrief about the show. On the sidewalk outside the gallery there was live music provided by Pastor Ken’s Jazz Quartet, a Speak Your Peace crafts table, and a step and repeat with silly props!
After taking time to look at each of the 60+ pieces and read the artist statements, we encouraged everyone to answer the question “How does this art make you feel?” and write their reactions on post-its and stick them on the window. People wrote that they felt “engaged,” “hopeful,” “inspired,” “reflective,” “appreciative,” “thankful,” and more. Others wrote messages like: “I feel it helps the community come together,” “it makes me feel alive and makes life just a little better,” “it makes me want to end violence,” and “there is beauty in brokenness”. We hope that everyone who came to the opening left with a variety of thoughts and feelings about the show and renewed hope in the power of art to build community and take a stand against violence.
If you missed the opening and want to see the show, or if you came to the opening and want more time to engage with all of this amazing work, drop by our open gallery hours:
The show is also a contest for all of the youth artist who submitted. Stay tuned! We will be announcing the judges’ picks on our blog June 3!

How is it that life gets so crazy hectic? I keep thinking mine's going to settle down, but it never does. Still, a girl can't live in a tornado every day. Sometimes it's good to take a break and just breathe... which is what Gerhardt and I did yesterday. We ran away with some friends to the Washington Coast town of Westport. En route we visited the Westport Winery for lunch. The food at the winery was great. I enjoyed my quiche with Tarragon/Aioli sauce, and I don't regret that piece of raspberry-cream pie I had for dessert. I don't, I don't, I don't! (That's because I haven't stepped on the scale - I have to get serious about this diet, but I think I'll wait until after the Fourth of July.) In town, we walked along the waterfront and enjoyed the sea air and the view of fishing boats. As you can see by the picture above, it was a perfect June day - blue sky and warm weather.
Now, today, we are back in crazy land dealing with everything from downsizing to guardianship issues for our handicapped daughter. I am SO glad I ran away yesterday. And tonight I think I'll run away again... inside a good book.
Usually, I'll run away to a movie - especially in the summer. Give me robots, superheroes, special effects, anything that makes a great popcorn movie escape. And if it is an old-fashioned drive-in theater, all the better!
Today, again a birthday plot, and as the month of February is full of birthdays, my little finger tells me that this is certainly not the last of the month !!
Container homes are now becoming an increasingly popular alternative for home builders looking for something different. They are cost-effective, easy to construct and have many eco-friendly benefits. For many excited architects and builders shipping containers are providing a new stunning form of architecture, where shipping containers can be used as building blocks and large structural elements for houses, offices and even city structures.
Container houses are constructed with overseas shipping containers. They are very affordable and strong enough to become the framework for your home. Building a sea container home is very simple. Builder places one or several overseas sea containers onto a standard foundation, shape windows and doors into the sea container walls.
Next they insulate the modified container suitably to resist cold & heat, decorate it and hey presto! – your shipping containers have evolved into your very own ultra modern home. The modular structure of overseas sea containers means that they can be easily attached to one another. The very nature of this allows architects to create both interesting and unique home designs.
Today, it is time for us to take the next step forward, stop using nonrenewable natural resources, and start being responsible in our interaction with the environment around. People have already found many ways to become more eco-friendly and responsible. buy shipping container house, container living.
You need to think about your personal needs, your financial situation, and local building codes before you make the investment of building your own container home. buy shipping container house, container living.
In the 20th century mankind made a great step forward in its technical and industrial evolution. Rapid quantitative and qualitative development of multiple industries has moved our lifestyle to an absolutely new level. buy shipping container house, container living.
Though container housing a new concept, the popularity and public interest in them is growing rapidly in many countries. The obvious economic benefits, with the green eco-friendly practices of recycling and sustainability, create a lot of opportunity for modern architects and builders to develop and improve the container home concept. buy shipping container house, container living.
Architects are exploring the endless possibilities of construction using shipping containers. In Berkeley, California, an art group constructed The Shipyard, a collaborative art studio and gallery space constructed entirely out of cargo containers. Twenty-seven shipping containers surround an 11,000 square foot outdoor lot. buy shipping container house, container living.
The shipping container home project has the interesting title of “Push-Button House” because it can be loaded in the back of a truck to be moved and it opens up like a Murphy bed to expose the interior. buy shipping container house, container living.
An even better option is to work with a company that specializes in cargo container architecture. They will have an expert opinion on everything you will need to do, and they might even be able to sell you a container for your home and make all of the modifications you need ahead of time. By dealing with one company, you can be sure of what all of your costs will be, since you will not need to reconcile quotes from different vendors and contractors. buy shipping container house, container living.
But what is the price for that evolution? Unfortunately, today we face some of the price tags we failed to recognize in the past: devastated rainforests, ozone holes, global warming, and exhausted natural fuel resources. buy shipping container house, container living.
You will also need to ship the container to your building site, which might be more expensive than you think. Foundation work also needs to be done, which tacks on extra cost. Before you purchase a shipping container for your new home, consult with a knowledgeable building contractor who can accurately calculate your total cost. buy shipping container house, container living.
Improving the technology, developing better insulation materials, and, of course, popularizing this type of alternative housing.of a particular alternative house should always be an individual decision to comply with all the requirements and expectations of a particular person or family. buy shipping container house, container living.
However, there is some skepticism with the benefits of these alternative houses. For example, it is argued that the high heat conductivity of steel requires better insulation for such houses in comparison to the usual brick or wood houses. buy shipping container house, container living.
They can be moved virtually anywhere there is a road and it is easy to hook up plumbing and electrical connections to the outside of the shipping container. buy shipping container house, container living.
The goods are packed in containers to be transported from ports to the cities, and because the cost of transportation would be too high to send them back to the ports, a lot of empty containers end up dumped on sites. buy shipping container house, container living.
And most importantly, you will need to consult with local authorities to make sure your new container home meets all local building codes. Some communities simply won’t allow homes constructed out of shipping containers. If this is the case, you may be out of luck, but it’s much better to find out before you invest money or begin construction. buy shipping container house, container living.
Humanitarian issues – Most architects have noted that the prefab shipping container habitat is ideal for setting up in emergency situations and for humanitarian needs. These very structurally sound and durable homes can be moved easily on the back of trucks and can be loaded and unloaded numerous times with no damage or need for repairs. buy shipping container house, container living.
First, you need to realize that a shipping container home is definitely not a traditional house. This may seem obvious, but it’s an important factor to consider. Even though homes built out of cargo containers seem really cool now, you may find that the novelty wears off after a few years. buy shipping container house, container living.
Another point is energy saving during home construction, which is usually much quicker in comparison to traditional house building. On the other hand, when a shipping container is out of service, it is either stored indefinitely (wasting away and contaminating soil) or melted down resulting in high energy losses and atmosphere contamination. Building container homes, hotels, hospitals, and dormitories allows us to avoid those scenarios. buy shipping container house, container living.
The containers can be easily recycled into new containers or other steel items, but there is an even more practical solution: they can be used to build homes. Containers are used as makeshift dwellings in many parts of the world, but only recently architects started playing with the idea of designing a comfortable home out of them. buy shipping container house, container living.

"25 Years Working With Cranberry People on a Local Basis' -— FIFTEEN Edp r =i INTRODUCTION As all cranberry growers know, labor is the most expensive item connected with the produc- tion, of cranberries. Of the various operations involved in production,haresting the crop requires the greatest amount of labor. Increasingly, mech: anization is reducing the amount of labor used, l I I in cranberry production as it is in all other lRBE agricultural production. A phase of the harvesting operation that would 0 . by JOHN S. NORTON benefit from further mechanization is the handling of the bushel boxes of cranberries after they are picked. In the past, the boxes of berries growers equipped ,f all the growers have been hauled from the bog to the shore on their trucks with roller-conveymeans wheelbarrows or small motorized wagons. They ors o some other of were then stacked at the side of the bog road moving loaded pallets about, where they were later hand loaded into flat-bed th aingo pallets aded abth or van-ype trucks for delivery to the packing pla waitin t pa kioe plants.

Current Limitations of the System small acreages will be reluctant to develop equipment for load ing dump trucks and will still hire flat trucks of vans to haul their berries, regardless of wea ther they will be sold as fresh fruit or processed. These grow ers could still benefit from pal letizing their bushel-boxes as outlined above.

Some cranberries get picked and packed and sent to mar ket and no one ever hears of them. Some years they fetch a pretty good price. And other years ... well, that's agriculture for you. But, some cranberries get picked and packed and sent to market with Ocean Spray labels on them. They get their pictures taken. They get talked about in magazines and newspapers. And on TV and radio from coast to coast. Over the years, they've fetched a better price for their growers than any other cranberry. Every year, people buy more of them than all other cranberries combined. Because, every year, Ocean Spray does more things with more cranberries than anybody else.

The consultation follows a promise Mayor Justin Lester made during te wiki o te reo Māori (Māori language week), when he said Wellington would work towards becoming a te reo Māori city.“Te reo Māori is an integral part of who we are as a country and as a city. We want to lead the way in making this part of the cultural fabric of our city,” he said.
As a first step the council has developed a draft te reo Māori policy called Te Tauihu, and is calling for submissions on the policy and ideas on how it can be implemented.
Deputy Mayor Jill Day, who led the development of the policy, said the council is very keen to hear from a broad range of people living in Wellington.
“We want to gather as many varied ideas as possible on how we can make this policy real - how we can enact it. We want people to be creative and think outside the square."
“The Māori language has inherent mana and importance, and we need to acknowledge that by making it more visible in our city.”
There is more information and an online form to make submissions on the Wellington Council website. You can also have your say by or even on Facebook.
For a host of reasons, I do try to limit my travel. But I also do give talks, and I do do interviews, and this corner of the blog will tell you what's upcoming. If you'd like me to come speak, send me an email at jewishfarmer@gmail.com, and we'll see if we can work things out.
On February 16 at 3pm, I'm giving a FREE talk on the basics of food storage - why and how - at my friend Joy's store, The Olde Corner Store 133 Factory, Gallupville NY 12073. 518-872-1610. All are welcome, and Joy will be offering a discount to anyone who wants to get started in storing bulk foods.
Coming out in the fall of this year, _Depletion and Abundance: Life on the New Home Front_ focuses on how families can adapt to a lower energy, hotter world - and help hold back the worst of the disaster as well.
Coming in Spring '09, _A Nation of Farmers_ co-authored with Aaron Newton explores our current agricultural situation, makes a case for a sustainable future, and draws the connections between our agriculture and our lost democracy.
I'm a 35 year old writer and subsistence farmer, author of two forthcoming books on Peak Oil and Climate Change _Depletion and Abundance: Life on the New Home Front_ (Fall '08) and _A Nation of Farmers (And Cooks)_ (Spring '09) the latter co-authored with Aaron Newton. Both books are forthcoming from New Society Publishers. I used to run a small, Jewish themed CSA, but now we're concentrating on subsistence agriculture, growing food and teaching others to grow food. My training was in literature, focusing on the Renaissance and demographic and cultural crises of the 17th century. I've switched to focusing on the demographic and cultural crises of the 21st century for the moment, but retain an interest in all things literary. In my spare time (of which there isn't much), my husband Eric and I are raising Eli (7 1/2), Simon (6), Isaiah (4) and Asher (2), and assorted critters and livestock, building an agrarian future.
Ok, I'm about to pick on ASPO again. I can't help it. First there was my reaction to the conference schedule, which looks exactly like last year's conference schedule, and (here I suspect I can save some people the cost of a flight to Houston) can be summed up as "Peak Oil is Real Soon Now." Then there was the conference theme, "A Time to React?" in the ASPO Europe Conference. (Note: I mistakenly wrote that this applied to ASPO-USA at first - my error). With a question mark on the end??!? Are these people out of their minds? I tried so hard not to pick on them any more - after all, we're on the same side. But that question mark pushed me over the edge...
Note: Some people have assumed that since I'm speaking at the Community Solutions Conference that I'm in someway trying to represent their approach as comparatively better, or that I'm criticizing ASPO because I'm speaking at Community Solutions, doing a "my conference is better than yours" - something that never occurred to me until a poster mentioned it. That's absolutely not the case. First of all, anyone who works at Community Solutions will tell you that I'm at least as much of a pain in the ass to them as I am to ASPO. I do agree with some of the things Community Solutions does, and not others, and you can count on me to say so loudly when I think they are wrong too. For example, I wasn't too pleased to see Pat Murphy, Richard Heinberg and Julian Darley up on stage last year having an all-guy's chat about what we should do about population, and I've said so publically several times. Secondly, this is my blog, and I speak only and always for myself, never as a representative of any group. I think the leaders of all such groups are duly grateful that they aren't responsible for me ;-). It was never my intention to plug one conference by dissing another, and it still isn't.
"Peak Oil is Real Soon Now" was pretty much the theme of last year's Boston ASPO conference, and I admit, I see no real evidence that it won't be repeated at every ASPO meeting, until we can officially change it over to "Peak Oil Was Just a While Back." http://www.aspo-usa.com/aspousa3/matrix.cfm. Looking over the list of panels, virtually all of them focus on one of three things.
The first is whether peak oil was Yesterday, is Tomorrow or next Thursday. Now this sounds like very important work, and is important if you have millions invested in oil wells, run India, or run Shell. To anyone else, it is largely a matter of complete and utter irrelevance. The reality is that real people are already experiencing the costs of peak oil - for example, it is the end of cheap oil that has led to the biofuels boom and to my grocery bill going haywire. This is only going to get worse - because of peak oil and climate change. But whether it gets worse slightly faster or slower really isn't the point - the point is that we're not doing anything about it. I'm willing to bet, however, that most of the Very Important People speaking at ASPO don't actually buy their own groceries, so maybe they haven't noticed.
The problem here is that ASPO hasn't noticed that peak oil has gone mainstream (that question mark again), and is still under the impression that the very important work that petroleum geologists have done in recognizing that peak oil was near, and warning the world is work that should still be at the center of things. And I don't mean to say here that their work is unimportant - but if ASPO has just one chance to pull people together to talk about peak oil, the date is far less urgent a subject than "where do we go from here?" It isn't that there isn't anything to talk about, it isn't that people still aren't debating peak oil. It is that the focus of the discussion has moved on from when to what to do, and ASPO hasn't caught up.
This is not only bad for the public discourse, but IMHO, it isn't very good for ASPO, either. Because they risk being rendered obsolete by their own data. ASPO has done the important work of establishing dates and reserves, but shortly, if their own estimates are right, when peak oil is will be an established, documentable fact - if it isn't already. And while ASPO will then have the satisfaction of being right, it will also have the problem of being irrelevant, if it hasn't taken a lead on the next step - where do we go from here?
As a purely practical matter, the Hirsch report demonstrates that we're well behind the ball - close to twenty years behind. Given that truth, that we cannot expect an orderly adaptation, one would think that the major study center for peak oil would be figuring out how we could triage and adapt the most urgent areas first. Unfortunately, that's not true. If ASPO wants to remain even remotely relevant, it needs to shift its focus, and lose the question mark - it is long past time to react. I understand that ASPO wishes to speak to the powerful and elite, and scaring them is bad for business. But telling the truth, even when unpalatable, is, I think, more important than looking friendly.
The second thing ASPO focuses on is making sure that rich people get to stay rich in a volatile market. If you have a few million dollars to invest in oil wildcatting, ASPO is the place to go. If you want to know which big businesses will boom in solar technology and biofuels, check out ASPO! If you don't wish to endure the tragedy of seeing your hedge fund decline, ASPO is there to help. If, however, you don't have large investments and are already just getting by, tough patooties. If you are wondering how to shift to a non-debt based economy, or resolve the consumption paradox, or even promote conservation, ASPO is not your friend.
Unless, of course, you have an exciting new technology to pimp. That's the other thing that ASPO will do - they'll tell you about the latest innovations in hybrid cars, light rail and nuclear power plants. If you are shopping for a high tech solution for your neighborhood, there's a good chance that they've got something coming your way. I was assured by an ASPO board member that there won't be any repeats of the Raytheon weapons designer who got up to sell his wife's new oil extraction techniques (and I'm sure would take a few orders for tasers on the side) or the "environmentalist" wind farm guy who builds filthy diesel plants in poor neighborhoods, both of whom starred at last year's ASPO, but there's a heavy "investor recruitment" element in which corporations sell their new toys.
Is it all bad? No, I'll give them credit for at least mentioning climate change and health care this year. And I honestly think that most of the people who run ASPO mean well. Their data analysis is terrific, and for people who are too lazy to read the papers on the internet and need to see middle aged men read them aloud to believe, there's value. But the reality is that ASPO has found its niche - and it is in saying "we're important, because we can tell you when...and we won't scare you by saying anything significant has to change." They are engaged in what James Kunstler has described as the notion that all we have to do is worry about keeping the cars on the road. And because most of them have access to an enormous amount of information that says otherwise, I find this particularly troubling. These are people who have read the data, and know that we're too close to peak oil for an easy, smooth transition - and yet, they are still selling one, or at least they were at last year's conference, and I don't see any evidence that that's changed.
There's not a single mention of food or agriculture at ASPO that I can find, not a single mention of housing. No mention of povery abatement, the third world, ecology, justice or conservation. Not a single mention of education or health care, children or families. No mention of the people who are already experiencing the consequence of peak oil - the poor who are being priced out of energy in the third world, and the American poor who are suffering from high food and transportation prices. No mention of capitalism, and growth. No link to a single political figure who deals with health, welfare, education or the environment - even though we all know that the first effects of peak oil will be economic.
There's no mention of the Oil Depletion Protocolo or any plan to get nations to adopt it or any other strategy for managing resources. At least ASPO Europe through Colin Campbell can boast of a real and meaningful policy plan that might make a difference, if we could get it applied. Where is such a plan from American peakists? I will give them points for upping the number of women speakers from 1 in 10 to 1 in 8. But ASPO, as far as I can tell, is still focused more on looking good to powerful people than telling the truth about peak oil, or than offering meaningful solutions.
Could the question mark mean "is there really time to react?" or are we just closing the barn door after the horse?
What do you expect Sharon? ASPO is full of academia types who love to have conferances so they can hear themselves talk and socialize over drinks. I don't think any (if so few) have gotten dirty rehabbing a house to make it low energy, or digging a garden or even doing so much as touching some of the alternatives in the marketplace.
If we want real change it will have to be inviduals and possibly business leaders trying to save themselves (and their companies) who will do it.
We've seen enough examples in our lifetime to know that academics and government people don't have the backbone to make changes.
The question mark should be because it is very likely that Peak Oil already happened. I personally believe this blog is far more relevant to most people as you address "What to do?".
Thank goodness for you, Sharon. It's good to have some people out there cutting through the BS and calling a spade a spade.
MEA, you are far kinder than I am -and I have to say that if the question mark does imply what you suggest, it is the stupidest, most awkward grammatical construction of all time.
Matt, speaking as a former academic, I don't mind ASPO taking a scholarly approach - I think that has value. I object to their taking an irrelevant scholarly approach ;-).
I feel the same way reading a lot of stuff on Peak Oil. Keep wanting to hold their own graphs up to them and say "Uh, guys? The time for that was around when I was *born*, can we get with the picture here please..."
There's more than one organization holding conferences. ASPO has always been technically oriented, while the Community Solutions deals with more fundamental social and economic responses. ASPO is one week, and CS is the following week. CS doesn't have technical talks, ASPO doesn't have practical talks. I'm speaking as a financial planner (not an investment guy)on an ASPO panel, and another planner is doing the same on another panel, but we're the only financial planners talking at either conference.
Would it be possible for you please to take part in the international Bloggers Day of Action for Burma on this Thursday, 4 October, in view of the events happening there at present. It would be much appreciated if all bloggers possible could take part in this. Info on
Also, it was the international ASPO conference in Ireland that asked the question. The ASPO-USA conference in Houston is titled "Energy: the First Challenge of the 21st Century."
I hope that makes you feel a little better, though the speaker list is admittedly quite similar to last year's in Boston.
I'm eager to see what the third point is (you said there were three things we can always expect to hear at an ASPO conference, but only got to point two!)
From your point of view (that of **cultural change**), much of the subject matter from ASPO is irrelevant.
But from the point of view of government and business, ASPO-type analysis is crucial. One reason NPC, IEA, investors and the oil companies are starting to pay attention to peak oil is the constant stream of high quality analysis that is coming from engineers, geologists and scientists.
In the coming era, it is critically important how investment decisions are made. Does a city expand its airport and freeway system? Does a corporation invest in expansive energy-saving equipment? Does a small businesswoman invest in a business that depends on cheap gasoline?
Whether one is red, green or libertarian, these decisions will have to be made -- and without good data, people will make the wrong decisions.
Novafp, you are correct, of course, that I was conflating ASPO USA's title. I'll have to conceed that the yadda yadda 21st century title is boring but much better than the "Time to React?" Thank you for the correction.
Bart, the third point is in there, just not labelled point by point - the third thing ASPO does is sell/pimp big shiny techno things.
But while I agree with you that ASPO needs to spend time on the basic issues of when Peak Oil is, and that ASPO's papers are invaluable, I don't agree that spending four days reiterating the same points over and over again is either necessary or wise, both from the standpoint of getting things done and from the standpoint of ASPO having any kind of long term relevance.
The reality is that at some point the focus will change to "peak oil was just a while back" and as long as ASPO keeps its focus tightly on "when" and away from public policy changes that might affect most people, away from solutions that can be done without massive investments and large corporate subsidies, it is likely to become irrelevant when we no longer need it to pick a date. When the answer to "how much oil is left" is "not enough," geologists will still have stuff to do refining on that point, but the absolute urgency of focusing on it will be long, long gone.
The reality is that the answer to the questions you list is fairly obvious if you accept peak oil - no, yes, no. I'm not mocking you, and I realize not everyone is aware of peak oil - the one part of the conference that I think has real value is the city by city component that allows whatever town ASPO sets down in for a year to talk a little about their own infrastructure. But by keeping the focus on airports and freeways, we miss the larger point that's not what's at stake. As long as we keep speaking as though those are the choices at hand, we're going to be reinforcing the value of false choices.
I don't make the distinction you do between "culture change" and "government and business" - governments and businesses need good data, which ASPO provides, and good *analysis* which IMHO, ASPO is not providing here. And if anyone should know better, they should. It isn't "culture change" to say that we can't afford to keep all the cars on the road, or that any upgrade of car fleets won't happen fast enough to make a difference - that's data analysis, and I'd hope for better from ASPO.
At this time, though, I think that the quantitative analyses are of utmost importances - as boring and repetitive as they may seem to many.
1. For communicating with certain groups, they are required. Numbers are the language spoken by scientists, investors, corporations and government agencies. You and I may be convinced that it's obviously a bad move to invest more in highways and airports, but they aren't listening to our opinions. They will listen to analyses and reports, however.
2. To convince these groups, one needs to build a water-tight case. We need studies which take different approaches, but which lead to the same conclusion. We need people from all parts of the political spectrum, from different nations, from different professions.
3. We don't really understand how peak oil will occur. Will supplies drop precipitously? Or will we be on a plateau for 10 years?
Then there are the interactions with other issues: coal usage, climate change, a nuclear renaissance (peak uranium?).
One example of the importance of analysis is the prospect of peak phosphorus. Sure, we've all known that we're pissing nutrients away with our sewage systems, but it was only a Hubbert Linearization analysis that brought home to me that phosphorus not oil could be the limiting factor for humanity. (Peak phosphorus / Background readings )
There are plenty of great ideas for sustainable living, but without the sinew of analysis, they are ignored - as they have been for the last 40 years. Although the quantitative types at ASPO and The Oil Drum take a different approach than visionaries, the visionaries really have no greater friends.
On the other hand, I don't think it would hurt ASPO-USA to go beyond the engineering / technocratic mindset. The recent ASPO conference in Ireland had right-brainers Nate Hagens and Rob Hopkins talk, and somehow people survived.
It's a bit like the four stage foreign office response to any crisis, as described so well in Yes, Prime Minister.
Sir Humphrey Appleby: Stage two, we say something may be about to happen, but we should do nothing about it.
Sir Richard Wharton: In stage three, we say that maybe we should do something about it, but there's nothing we *can* do.
Sir Humphrey Appleby: Stage four, we say maybe there was something we could have done, but it's too late now.
Stage three can have added to it, "the problem needs careful study." So for example if your car is stuck on the railway tracks and think you hear the toot of the horn of a train coming, you can sit there arguing with your fellow passengers about whether or not the train is coming, and if so, exactly how far away it is. Toot, toot.
The point of debate is to avoid action, so that someone else will be the one to make the difficult decisions. Just imagine being the a US Presidential candidate and trying to get elected on a platform of no more burgers and SUVs. Try it out, see if you win.
Bart, always fun to switch sides. Again, I don't think the data analysis is the issue - I think that many of the ASPO analysts do good work, and yes, there's a role for refining this. There's a role for talking about it to - just not as the primary or sole point of discussion for 4 days. There's room for running analysis *and* talking about the future. I'll agree with you that the papers are invaluable - but I don't think we need to read them all out loud for four days, or that that's the most productive things that could be done at a conference.
But I guess the big issue for me is that there is no such thing as res ipsa loquitor - things don't speak for themselves. Data doesn't speak for itself. It requires analysis. And much of the underlying content of the analysis here is "life is going to stay the way it is." I don't think you can divorce the data from its analytic framework.
The other thing is that I just don't see the distinction you do between visionaries and data. Sure, I don't do a lot of hard regressive analysis, but there are plenty of technical thinkers who are also talking about the future in useful productive ways - Ted Patzek's paper that you folks just discussed, or Pat Murphy's extensive analysis of transportation and housing options. I'm not opposed to data analysis - I agree, it is essential. But we have to put our resources where it matters. And dozens and dozens of really smart people hammering on the same minute differences is missing the really big elephant in the room that could use some analysis too.
Actually, the presentation that I am going to be giving at ASPO-USA on Net Oil Exports is pretty hard hitting stuff.
Our basic point is that, from the point of view of importing countries, overall world production is pretty much irrelevant. What counts is the volume of exported oil. Our model, recent case histories and current data suggest that net exports will decline much more rapidly than overall production declines.
In any case, I think that Alan Drake will be giving the most important talk at ASPO-USA, on Electrification Of Transportation (EOT). Alan asks a simple, but powerful, question, to-wit, how did we cost effectively and efficiently move people and goods around in the past, with minimal oil input?
Assume that you were able to set the agenda for ASPO or a similar organization -- what would you want to see?
I think that change will be coming faster and more dramatically than most of us think possible. What seems to be visionary today will be standard fare soon.
Instead of, "when's it going to run short?" I'd be saying, "okay, it's running short: what shall we do?"
Whether the train is 1,000 yards or 10 yards away doesn't change the fact that we need to get off the damn tracks. Okay, once we're off the tracks, where do we go, and how?
I remember reading Goebbels' diary in which he described in his entries for late February 1945 a reform of the German income tax system. A couple of million Red Army troops were across the Elbe, a million or so Allies across the Rhine, Italy collapsed and taken by the Allies, Dresden had been firebombed and 100,000 people killed in one night, Germany was facing utter defeat, the entire Nazi state about to be brushed into the dustbin of history, the country entirely rebuilt and changed unrecognisably, and... they were talking about reforming income tax.
I have been lurking for some time now -- many thanks Sharon for sharing your thoughts with us. I have quite a few of your individual posts bookmarked, and frequently refer people to them.
So I was startled when this post struck a raw nerve, almost as if I felt you had betrayed some sacred cause. The evident depth of your feeling on the matter only heightens the effect.
Your position seems so reasonable that I have had a hard time putting my finger on what bothers me. But I think it's something like this ...
Peak oil, like global warming, presents a situation that cannot be mitigated by individual preparation. In both situations, we sink or swim together. I believe that life for you personally will be far better if everyone started right now to prepare in the same spirit that you do than if only 1 in 10,000 did so.
To that end, it is not sufficient that a few of us believe that the peak is so imminent that the precise timing hardly matters any more. People have to be persuaded en masse, and at the moment I don't find that they generally are.
In the case of climate change, the only way out of the mess seems to be to somehow manufacture the political will necessary to support -- even demand -- drastic change. Members of the scientific community have long been convinced that we have a problem and that the chance to act is slipping away. And yet, I still believe there is value in the recent IPCC reports that effectively consolidate and repeat ad nauseum the same message that has been in the air for years. The reports still focus largely on whether anthropogenic warming is real, and if so what the best guess is as to the timing and likely effect. The scientists all understand that the time for debate is long past and that we're staring directly into the teeth of catastrophe, but they also acknowledge the reality that little will be gained by advising people how to adjust and prepare if they are not simultaneously convinced that there is a need to adjust or prepare.
I see ASPO as playing a similar role. There is no shortage of credible peak oil material that I can refer people to, but they generally aren't often persuaded by fact, logic and reason. These are people who believe whatever they read in the paper as long as the person quoted is labeled an expert. There are a lot of "experts" out there still claiming that peak oil is a farce, just as there are "experts" still claiming that global warming is a farce (and finding traction for their ideas). The recent activity of ASPO gives us a density and relative unanimity of expert opinion that I haven't found anywhere else.
I completely agree that we desperately need to get on with the business of understanding how to plan. But I believe that if ASPO were to significantly focus on that, the result would be debatable enough to give rise to so many petty quibbles that the focus on urgency would be lost. Unless we achieve mind share on the reality of the issue, and a spark of political will to do something, things will go poorly no matter how much quality planning is done. We still need people to focus intently on that first step (while others get on with the planning), and for me, ASPO fills the role.
Hmm. I'm not sure if I've even convinced myself. Still, this is salve for my nerve. Thanks again for your efforts.
Steve, I can understand your point, but I admit, I don't buy it. I was at last year's ASPO conference as a correspondant, I interviewed a whole lot of people, almost all of whom had one thing in mind - their own money and its future happiness. It isn't that there wasn't anything useful in the presentations, or that individually some of the speakers aren't wonderful. But no presentations at all focused, for example on conservation - even though the potential returns on that are far vaster than anything we'll get from the finest extraction technologies. And that's what bothers me the most - it isn't like the scientists over at ASPO don't know that. They just aren't saying it because it is sexier to talk about bright shiny toys.
And in the desire to be sexy, and not too scary, to attract people with lots of money, there's a fundamental incompatibility. You cannot, for example get Michael Klare to talk about how to avoid resource wars, and allow the people who get rich from the resource wars a platform to advertise their wares, as they did last year.
And I think the IPCC report is a good analogy. Because the result of the IPCC report has been to give a lot of people the false sense of security that we have plenty of time - yes, it is a big deal, but we've got to 2050 before we have to worry - even as the data came out that made it clear that almost certainly isn't true, at least in terms of ice melting, the oceans, the amazon rainforest - all major tipping factors.
We'll all be just as screwed if governments and leaders are given bad information that doesn't traumatize them too much and doesn't drive them to move forward in time, or if they don't do anything. Timing is just as important as the data itself.
Bart, the thing I'd most like to see in a policy discussion of peak oil is to see the analysis of the problem match the data. For example, as far ASPO doesn't seem to be doing anything to encourage adoption of the ODP, nor does it seem to want to discuss rationing, or any other way that we might assure stable supplies in a fair way. I'd like their expressions of the urgency of the problem to be matched up by a similar focus on making change. I think that in a four day conference, you could easily spend two days on solutions with no great loss of clarity - lord knows, last year's conference included an enormous amount of duplication of purpose.
Jeffrey, I agree that's a good question, and that electrification of transport is a real issue. I'd be pleased to see similar discussion of the re-opening of water transport (which is, after all, more efficient than most electrified vehicles) and about not going places, which is the most efficient solution of all. But again, I don't say all the panels are a waste of time - but I think the sheer quantity of carbon people will be burning to get themselves to ASPO means that the total return has to be damned high. I don't see evidence that that's true.
Thanks. You have hit a certain nail on the head. If I hear or see one more "2007 or 2025" debate, chart, etc....anyway.
Like a gaggle of people standing on the railroad tracks watching the train coming and expostulating about how fast it's coming and the exact moment they will get hit.
Action time is now. Thank the good folks at ASPO for being the voice from the wilderness that's not so much out in the wilderness anymore. We got it.
1. They are actually doing something, rather than just grumbling. Moreover, they have gone beyond individual action and established an organization, with regular publications and conferences. There is a degree of professionalism there which makes them easy to work with.
3. They are committed to doing what it takes to communicate with the larger public. They have begun issuing press releases, talking to the press, producing videos, establishing alliances with other groups. This is pretty impressive for a small group.
4. They are contributing to the larger movement of building up a scientific and theoretical case for peak oil, and examining the consequences. They are attempting to do this with scientific and academic rigor.
On the other hand, I sympathize with Sharon's criticisms. But you know, there are many groups who have been beavering away at sustainability for decades (permaculture, the New Urbanism, bicycling groups, Greens, Deep Ecology). I love them, but oh how I wish they could be more professional. Working with them is like trying to herd cats.
So, if you want to go beyond ASPO's limitations, great! But it would be wise to learn from them as well.
BTW. I have no connection with ASPO, except that I re-post their articles with their permission and correspond with a few ASPO members.
Bart, I'll cede you the point there - they do have a good organizational structure. And I know just what you mean about cat herding. This is why I don't live in an ecovillage - too many years being a leftist who did everything by consensus ;-).
I guess that's why I make these criticisms - I think ASPO could be really important in shaping the future - if they want to be. I'm not convinced they are on the right track.
That said, I'll cheerfully admit that I'm not interested in founding a heirarchical, well organized politically astute think-tank on the future. Writing already way too much into my carrot-growing time ;-). So the implied "if you want it to be different, you do it" criticism does stand also.
Looking ahead to the problems of after peak, a very practical appraoch is rationing and a great scheme is Tradable Energy Quotas. This is the only solution I know that heads off catastrophe. Why isnt it getting headlines? (And that was a question mark. :) )
I do agree with many of these criticisms of the upcoming conference. However, I also know that lots of people still don't have a clue about peak oil, and big conferences to convince people that the date is near might help, especially if there is any mainstream-press converage that gets the message out the conference doors.
I only say this because I have three siblings who work as engineers in the oil business. I have been bringing up the idea of peak oil for on and off for about four years now, and the primary response is still, "there's plenty of oil." The problem seems to be that they are so focused on their own oil fields that haven't stood back to see the big picture. At least, I am hoping that's the problem, since I know they are all very smart individuals.
As for the focus on technofixes---engineers are trained to solve problems, and the means they use in their work in the oil fields has always been technological, so the focus is pretty understandable, even if I don't agree with it. I don't know how we are going to get them to find other answers, but I am guessing that a lot of the answers are going to have to come from the rest of us, like your own focus on getting more people involved in food production and in rioting for austerity.
Gene Logsdon has a recent post, that relates to the ASPO issue of maintaining the status quo, up on the organic-to-be blog about economic inevitablility. Basically, he illustrates how people who look at the current trajectory of development assume it will continue in the same direction, and that something usually happens to totally change the trajectory. The big forcasts for more-of-the-same then turn out to be wrong.
So, all this isn't to say that I disagree with your post, because I do agree with it; I just can see why ASPO is still clinging to the same topics and that, for some people, the ASPO conference could be the crucial piece of a puzzle helps them see the whole picture. At least, I am hoping it is, because two of my engineer siblings live in Houston. They aren't going to the conference (although I tried...), but they have an increased chance of hearing more about peak oil if such conferences continue to meet.
Could you share the URL for the Gene Logsdon post? He's one of my favorites. He's been walking the sustainability talk for decades... and he's got a great sense of humor.
Thanks for the thoughtful response. I hope you don't try to add organizing to your already too full plate, though. You are already a one-women movement yourself.
About better organizations ... I'm serious in my suggestions. Visionaries could learn a lot from ASPO, as well as from successful organizing efforts from the past:
The most interesting approach now seems to be de-centralized, leaderless movements, with different groups co-operating on specific issues. One does not have to agree 100% with another group in order to co-operate.
Jeff Vail calls this a rhizome approach to organizing. This approach is particularly suited to the Web. And I think it is what we are doing right now with peak oil and sustainability, even though we may not realize it.
Historical precedents include the Popular Front of the 30s and the New Deal in the USA. The most spectacular success story is the modern conservative movement which managed to unify fundamentalists, libertarians, neo-conservatives and the corporate elite.

Helen Sworn is founder and director of Chab Dai, a coalition of Christians committed to ending sexual abuse and trafficking.
Helen Sworn will be in Vancouver later this week to speak about her experience with human trafficking in Cambodia and around the world. For details of her two events (and two other related initiatives) see below.
Now that it’s illegal to buy sex in Canada, anti-human trafficking activists like Helen Sworn are tentatively hopeful.
Sworn is founder and director of Chab Dai, a coalition of Christians committed to ending sexual abuse and trafficking. (Based in Cambodia, Chab Dai has branches in several other countries, including Canada; the name means “joining hands” in Khmer.)
Canada’s new prostitution law, Bill C-36, was adopted in 2014. The Bill made it illegal to buy sex, spurring a cacophony of voices: feminists land on every side. Human rights are touted by all, but both sexually conservative and sexually liberal observers support or reject the bill.
One point of agreement: the vulnerable, the marginalized must be protected. But who fits into that category of ‘vulnerable’? Scholars diverge. John Lowman, professor emeritus in criminology at SFU claims that sex work empowers women, even if it is their last resort – because it is a way of turning sexual capital into economic capital. Benjamin Perrin and Janine Benedet, law professors at UBC, view sex work as inherently exploitative of women.
“Cracking down on demand, on pimps, on johns, on drug dealers – it does provide a legal framework for the issue,” says Sworn, who has studied the effects of both legalization and criminalization of sex work. “But beating at it with a stick won’t stop the continuum of abuse.”
Canada’s Bill C-36 follows in the footsteps of the Nordic Model of legislation – one that criminalizes ‘johns’ rather than sex workers.
“The Nordic Model hasn’t worked well in Norway because it won’t work without the social support systems,” says Sworn.
“At the same time, a UN special report showed that since sex work was legalized in Germany – although the number of sex workers has grown from about 65,000 to 400,000 – only 44 of those workers chose to register themselves with a government-created national registry aimed to protect prostitutes.”
Aware of the pitfalls of both legalization and criminalization, Sworn looks to collaboration within the private non-profit sector for answers to the human rights abuses that are linked to the sex work industry.
Abuses run the gamut of human trafficking, including instances where legal recruitment agencies convince rural Cambodian families to change a daughter’s age on her ID card, sign a contract and have her working legally in a Montreal brothel within a year – despite her being underage.
“The whole of the global criminal network is connected. So stakeholders interested in fighting human trafficking need to find common ground, stop judging and stop silo-ing arguments,” says Sworn.
This drive to collaborate led Chab Dai Canada to partner with a sex workers’ union in Montreal, despite the clash between the two groups sexual mores.
“We got access into the brothels because the union agreed that all workers should have an opportunity to access counselling,” says Sworn. “To the union’s surprise, we ended up finding underage Cambodian girls there.”
Chab Dai’s collaborative approach has made the way for an online initiative that resembles a cross between Wikipedia and LinkedIn – social media for the fight against human trafficking. The online platform Freedom Collaborative, launched last year, is the first of its kind and has international ambitions.
“The reason that human trafficking is the fastest-growing criminal network in the world is that traffickers are networked and we are not,” says Sworn. “We need to network.”
There are over 170 organizations in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside doing humanitarian work, along with government resources, but there is no collective organism for partnership between the organizations. With this new online platform, Chab Dai hopes to link together government agencies, NGOs and grassroots movements in ending commercial sexual exploitation and human trafficking across Canada and beyond.
Through data collection, vetted memberships and a well-established steering committee, Freedom Collaborative will provide a referral mechanism for clients, a sharing of best practices and an attempt to patch over the gaps and overlaps that currently run rampant in the fight to end human trafficking.
Helen Sworn will take part in launching a Joining Hands for Justice Campaign over dessert and stories at Groundswell Cafe in the Downtown Eastside October 14, 7:30 – 9 pm.
Hear more from her at Tenth Church Mount Pleasant October 16, 1 – 2:30 pm, as she addresses the topic Ending Sex Slavery: It Takes a Network.
A local coalition says police and the city are not enforcing Canada’s human trafficking law. The Trafficked Human Campaign will hold a press conference at the corner of Joyce and Kingsway on Tuesday (October 18) to draw attention to the need to protect women, girls, and aboriginal youth from exploitation in Vancouver.
On October 21, Christ City Church will host Integrate: Sex Trafficking, Justice and the Gospel. Organizers describe the event in this way:
Worldwide, there are nearly two million children in the commercial sex trade. Let that settle in for a second. Two million children have been bought, sold or kidnapped and then enslaved. Two million.
Sex trafficking drives significant profits for perpetrators – a subset of the $150 billion market value of illicit human trafficking.
Phil Reilly of International Justice Mission (IJM) will make and presentation; he will then be joined by several panelists:
Over 18 is a documentary about pornography which will be showing at several churches in the area during November. The film, produced by Hope for the Sold (which also made Red Light Green Light) is “a feature-length documentary to combat pornography addiction among children and teens.”
Over 18 will be shown at West Coast Christian Fellowship (November 6), John Paul II Pastoral Centre (November 7), Granville Chapel (November 15) and Tenth Church East Van (November 16). It will also be shown at several Fraser Valley churches.

Authority of India (UIDAI) has ordered an investigation against Bharti Airtel for alleged violations of the Aadhaar Act and is threatening to slap a financial penalty for opening Airtel Payments Bank accounts of customers surreptitiously while carrying out Aadhaar verification of their mobile numbers. The probe against the company was ordered after complaints of prima facie violations were found to be valid, sources told TOI.
"The lapses are serious in nature. Prima facie, it is a criminal breach of trust and contract, and there are violations of provisions of the Aadhaar Act," said a source, who did not wish to be identified. The matter came to the fore when payments related to cooking gas subsidy landed into the Airtel Payments Bank account for some customers, and not in their pre-designated savings bank accounts with other banks.
Most of them complained against the transfer and said that they were unaware of Airtel Payments Bank accounts, which they alleged had been opened without their authorisation or knowledge. The subsidy amount — sent under the central government's Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme — is estimated at over Rs 40 crore. After being tipped off, UIDAI had initially served a showcause notice to Airtel as complaints of violations against the company's ground staff were highlighted.
When contacted, UIDAI CEO Ajay Bhushan Pandey said that the authority has received complaints of wrongdoing against "certain telecom companies" during the Aadhaar verification process. "We have ordered an investigation into the matter. If the allegations are found to be true, after a thorough investigation.

God has entrusted us with the responsibility and privilege of raising our children "in the Lord." We may have many desires for our children, but the one thing that supersedes all else is that they come to know and love the Lord Jesus Christ.
The Child Dedication services provide an opportunity for parents to publicly commit themselves and their children to the Lord. These services are a special time when parents publicly promise, by the grace of God, to teach their children of Christ by instruction and by example. The dedication service is a public declaration of the parents' dedication to Christ rather than merely a religious ritual regarding the child.
Our Child Dedication services take place during 11AM worship service. Please check our events calendar for a schedule of upcoming Child Dedication services. If you would like to dedicate your child/ren (and yourselves), please contact Pastor Carl Stubblefield.

If you’re trying to strengthen your kick, purchasing swim fins is a very good idea. They provide a powerful practice tool that will allow any swimmer to hone their skills in the water. Of course, you’re going to want to buy the best ones you can get. Here’s how you do that.
They are not all the same. In fact, there are several styles. It’s a good idea to learn more about the many different types. This will make it easier for you to find a good fit for someone like you.
If you’re trying to improve your butterfly or breast stroke, you may want to purchase mono fins. These will make it easier for you to keep your feet together as you swim. For young swimmers, you probably want to look into buying long fins. These models are a great training tool for kids.
If you’re trying to improve your speed, short fins are the smartest thing for you to buy. If you’re a competitive swimmer, you might want to invest in notch fins. These are used by a lot of professional swimmers as they train.
Take the time to think about what your goal is going to be. As long as you know what you are looking for, you should be able to find the ideal products for you.
While you should try to find the right type, you should also take a closer look at certain small details. As an example, you’re going to want to pay attention to the blade. This can tell you a lot about the fin.
A paddle blade will provide more resistance if it is very stiff. If you’re not an advanced swimmer, you may want to avoid a blade that is overly rigid. Too much resistance will make your training less effective and increase the risk of injuries. Too little resistance won’t let you train optimally.
It’s always a smart idea to take a look at reviews before you buy something. See what people that have used the fins have to say about them. Rave reviews are usually a sign of high-quality products, but it’s best to take a look at the negatives too.
It’s easy to find reviews online. You should try to make use of that. Read a lot of reviews so that you can identify some of the best swim fins on the market.
Not all swim fins have the same style of heel. Some have a closed heel. This is usually a good thing. They can help keep the fin securely on your feet as you kick.
With that said, closed heels aren’t your only option. If you want to improve your range of motion, you may want to purchase fins that have a more open heel. Just make sure you will still be able to attach them securely to your feet.
If you’ve bought swimming products in the past, you should take a look at the manufacturer that produced those products.
The brand name of a product can often be an indicator of quality. If your goal is to buy an excellent set, you should try to buy something that was made by a brand that commands a lot of respect. Don’t just look at the products themselves; find out who made those fins.
If you’re purchasing for yourself, you should make sure you are fully satisfied with what you get. Use these tips to choose the best models for your situation from the reviews below.
A lot of people don't understand just how beneficial swim fins can be. If you want to become a stronger swimmer, purchasing these is one of the smartest things that you can do. ...
Justin Visits Award Winning Specialist Support Provider Pluss For Employability Day - Swindon Conservatives
Pluss, who have provided specialist employment support for disabled jobseekers for more than 45 years, work to help secure employment opportunities in a wide range of businesses and job roles. In Swindon, where employment is at record levels, new opportunities are being created constantly for roles in the manufacturing, administration and nursing/care sectors in particular.
The visit formed part of the the annual Employability Day, coordinated by the Employment Related Services Association (ERSA), when hundreds of organisations throw open their doors to raise awareness about what they do to help people into work. The ERSA is the representative body for those delivering employment support services. ERSA’s membership spans the private, voluntary and public sectors and ranges from large multi-nationals through to small specialist charities. It has over 260 members and three quarters are not for profit.
During the visit, Justin highlighted that he would be dedicating time over the next few months into matching employers who have expressed an interest in hiring more disabled people with Pluss in order to assist great candidates in Swindon. Many of the programmes Pluss deliver are on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Big Lottery Fund, local authorities and the NHS.
Justin met with Simon and Saul, both with disabilities and on a Pluss work training scheme which provides people with valuable skills for employment and training including for interview skills.
During his tenure as the Minister for Disabled People, the North Swindon MP worked with Pluss and others to expand the Disability Confident Campaign, which attempted to break some of the myths around employing disabled workers, and promoting the benefits for businesses, the individual, and the economy.
Since then, Justin has carried on by organising a number of successful events, with Pluss featuring prominently, such as the reverse jobs fair at STEAM Museum, and the recent event at the Marriott Hotel in partnership with Horizon’s College and celebrity chef Marco Pierre White.
Justin Tomlinson MP said: “It was great to be invited to Pluss today to discuss both the successes of the Government’s policies to help more disabled people find employment. Pluss have been brilliant at recent events I have been part of organising, such as the disability employment event with Horizon’s College last month. It was great to visit again to see the training first hand and speak to the people benefiting from this excellent tailored support.”

"No one did more too shape the physical character of modern civilization than Thomas Edison.... Accordingly, he has to be considered the most influential figure of the millennium...." The Heroes Of The Age: Electricity And Edison
Surprisingly, little "Al" Edison did not learn to talk until he was almost four years old. Immediately thereafter, he began pleading with everyone in his family to explain the workings of almost everything he encountered in his environment. If they said they didn't know, he would look them straight in the eye with his deeply set and vibrant blue-green eyes and ask them "Why?"
Contrary to popular belief, Thomas Edison was not born into poverty in a backwater mid-western village. He was actually born (on Feb. 11, 1847) to middle-class parents in the bustling port of Milan, Ohio, a community that - next to Odessa, Russia - was the largest wheat shipping center in the world. In 1854, his family moved to Port Huron, Michigan, which ultimately surpassed the preeminence of both Milan and Odessa....
At age seven - after spending 12 weeks in a noisy one room schoolhouse with 39 other students of all ages - Tom's overworked and short tempered teacher finally lost all patience with the child's relatively self centered behavior and persistent questioning.... Noting that Tom's head was "slightly larger than average" he made no secret of his belief that the hyperactive youngster's brains were addled or "scrambled."
If modern psychology had existed back then, Tom would have probably been deemed a victim of attention deficit syndrome and proscribed a hefty dose of the "miracle drug" Ritalin. Instead, when his beloved mother - about whom he said: "She was the making of me. She was so true and so sure of me, I felt that I had someone to live for ~ someone I must not disappoint - became aware of the situation, she promptly withdrew him from school and began to "home-teach" him.
A descendant of the prominent Elliot family of New England, the devout daughter of a highly respected Presbyterian minister - and a trained educator in her own right - Nancy Edison (above) now commenced teaching her last and favorite son the "three Rs" and the Bible. Meanwhile, his father, Samuel, was much more inclined towards having him read the great classics, offering to pay him a ten cents reward for each one he he completed.
It wasn't long before the serious minded youngster had developed a deep and abiding interest in Science, World History, and English literature. Many years later, his specific fondness for some of Shakespeare's plays lead him to briefly consider becoming an actor. However, because of his high-pitched voice and extreme shyness before every audience - except those whom he was trying to influence in helping him finance an invention - he soon gave up the idea.
At age 11, Tom's parents tried to appease his ever more voracious appetite for knowledge by showing him how to utilize the resources of the local library. This was one of several impetuses that caused him to prefer learning through independent self instruction. Starting with the last book on the bottom shelf, he purportedly systematically read, or at least carefully perused, every book in the building. By age 12, he had not only devoured Gibbon's Rise And Fall Of The Roman Empire, Sears' History Of The World, and Burton's Anatomy Of Melancholy, he had also the consumed The World Dictionary of Science and a number of works on practical Chemistry.
In spite of their noble efforts - Tom's parents eventually found themselves totally incapable of addressing Tom's ever maturing intellectual needs. For example, when he queried them about concepts dealing with mathematics and physics - such as those found in Isaac Newton's "Principia" - they were absolutely stymied. Finally, they hired a clever tutor to help their precocious son more fully understand Newton's principles.
Unfortunately, this experience had a largely negative affect on the highly impressionable boy. He was so disillusioned by the fact that Newton's sensational theories were written in classical aristocratic terms - which he felt were "unnecessarily confusing to the average person" - he overreacted and adopted what developed into a life-long disrespect for almost all forms of high-level mathematics.
On the other hand, Tom immediately grasped the simple beauty inherent in Newton's physical laws. Moreover, his encounters with "The Principia" encouraged him to not only sharpen his free spirited style of thinking but to prove all things to himself through solid scientific experimentation.
Not surprisingly, during this highly formative period, Tom also initiated his life-long habit of gleaning everything he could from the writings of men of wisdom, keeping in mind the fact that "even they could be entrenched in preconceived dogma and associated error." He also cultivated a sense of tenacity during these years, and a willingness to expend whatever perspiration was needed to overcome a given challenge - which he later said "most people go out of their way to avoid."
Significantly, many of the above characteristics in Tom's personality would have probably not been so deeply ingrained during those formative years if he had not experienced a gradual loss of hearing.... While the condition may have prevented him from taking advantage of the benefits of a formal secondary education in contemporary mathematics, physics, engineering, it certainly didn't interfere with his propensity to come up with alternate ways to compensate....
Meanwhile, Tom's "free wheeling" style of observation and creativity caused him to handily reject many "established" engineering principles. , his unique perspective on everything in his environment provided him with a unique foothold in the world of practical science that ruled the latter half of the 19th Century.... More specifically, while most of his associates may have been "captives" of the "scientific pontifications" of the day, he tended to dispassionately challenge every established "fact" and assumption he encountered.... A "lone eagle," he rarely relied someone's opinion .... "If he finally came to wholly embrace some new idea it was only after his own exhaustive examination and experimentation revealed that it met his rigorous standards of what was factual....
Not surprisingly, Tom spent countless hours in contemplation and in his laboratory.... A contemporary said "He found pure joy in the the act of scheming out daring solutions to problems in his kaleidoscopic mind and then applying his legendary memory, dexterity, and patience to performing any and all experiments that were necessary to produce a new concept or invention." In sum, the above unique approach to life would serve him amazingly well at the dawn of the coming "Age Of Electricity."
By age 12, Tom had become a virtual adult... He had not only talked his parents into letting him go to work selling newspapers, snacks, and candy on the railroad, he had started an entirely separate business selling vegetables.....
At age 14 - at the time the famous pre-Civil War debates between Lincoln and Douglas - he exploited his access to the associated details that were being teletyped each day into the station and published them in a flyer.... As a result of the success of this effort, he gradually developed a splendid little newspaper called the Weekly Herald. Interestingly - because it was the first such publication ever to be type-set, printed, and sold on a train anywhere - an English journal gave him his first exposure to international notoriety when it featured the story in 1860.
When his hero, Abraham Lincoln, was finally nominated for president, Tom distributed campaign literature on his behalf and peddled flattering photographs of "the great emancipator" until he was elected President.
At its peak, Tom's mini-publishing venture netted him more than ten dollars a day, enabling him to provide for his own support. In the meantime, any extra income went to further outfitting the chemical laboratory he had set up in his home. However, when his usually tolerant mother finally complained about the danger of all the "poisons" he was amassing, he transferred most of them to a locked room in the basement and stored the remainder in a closet on the train.
One day, while traversing a bumpy section of track, the train lurched, causing a stick of phosphorous to roll onto the floor and ignite. Within moments, the baggage car caught fire. The conductor was so angry he severely chastised him and struck him with a powerful blow to the side of his head. Later, he was further penalized by being restricted to peddling his 400 daily papers only at railroad stations.
Late in his 14th hear, Tom contracted scarlet fever. While it remains uncertain, some biographers have assumed that the after effects of this condition - along with being struck on the side of the head by the above conductor - acted in consort to finally destroy most of his hearing....
Whatever the case - even though it now became impossible for Tom to acquire knowledge in a typical educational setting - he did not fret over the matter.... Readily adapting to anything that he was convinced was out of his control, he would simply commit himself to acquiring alternative methods of learning .
Equally remarkable, Tom actually learned to use the silence associated with his deafness to enhance his powers of concentration. Later in life, for example - when he had the means to have an operation that would have likely restored much of his hearing - he refused to act upon the option.... He was afraid he would have difficulty re-learning how to channel his thinking in a noisy world.
Ultimately becoming totally deaf in his left ear - and well over 80% deaf in his right ear - the thing that Tom missed most was the sound of singing birds. He loved the creatures so much, he would later amass an aviary of over 5,000 of them.
Tom's career of producing and selling newspapers on a train came to an abrupt end in 1861, when he and his press were permanently thrown off the vehicle by an "unsympathetic" associate of the railroad company. Although upset and confused by the incident, he continued to frequent the station area.
One day, the station master's child happened to wander onto the tracks in front of an oncoming boxcar. Tom leaped to action. Luckily - as they tumbled over and over to escape the oncoming wheels - he and the little boy ended up being only slightly injured. One of the most significant events in Tom's life now occurred when - as a reward for his heroism - the grateful father taught him how to use Morse code and the telegraph.
By age 15, Tom had pretty much mastered the basics of the fascinating new art of telegraphy and obtained a job as a replacement for one of the thousands of "brass pounders" (telegraph operators) who had gone off to serve in the Civil War. The opportunity not only further enhanced his speed and efficiency in sending and receiving code, it provided him with his first solid opportunity to study and experiment with the device....
Shortly after the Civil War ended, Tom decided - to his mother's great dismay - that the time had come for him to leave home and "seek his fortune." And, over the next few years he meandered throughout the Central States, supporting himself as a "tramp operator.
At age 16, after working and experimenting in a variety of telegraph offices, he finally came up with his first "authentic" invention. It was an automatic "repeating" device that transmitted telegraph signals between unmanned stations, allowing virtually anyone to translate code at their own convenience with relative ease and accuracy. Curiously, he never patented the initial version of this idea.
In 1868, after making a name for himself amongst his fellow telegraphers as being a rather flamboyant and quick witted character - who enjoyed playing "mostly harmless" practical jokes - he returned home one day ragged and penniless. Sadly, he found his parents in an even worse predicament.... First, his beloved mother was beginning to evince elements of insanity "which were aggravated by the strains of an often difficult life." Making matters even worse, his father had just lost his job and the local bank and was about to foreclose on the family homestead.
Tom promptly came to grips with the pathos at hand and - perhaps for the first time in his life - also came to grips with a number of his own shortcomings. In any case, after a lot of soul searching and contemplation he decided that the best thing he could do would be to get back out on his own and try to make some serious money.
A few months later, Tom accepted the advice of a fellow "lightening slinger" named Billy Adams to come East and apply for a permanent job as a telegrapher with the relatively prestigious Western Union Company in Boston. His willingness to travel over a thousand miles from home was partly influenced by the fact that he had been given a free rail ticket by the local street railway company for some repairs he had done for them. An equally important factor, however, was the fact that Boston was then widely perceived as "The hub of the scientific, educational, and cultural universe."
Interestingly, mid-19th century New England had numerous features that were analogous to today's Silicon Valley in California. But instead of being a haven for the thousands of young "tekkies" - who communicate with each other in the computerese and internet code of today - it was the home of scores of young telegraphers who anxiously stayed abreast of every stage of the emerging age of electrical technology and regularly "talked" with each via Morse code.
Even though Tom toiled 12 hours a day and six days a week for Western Union, he somehow found ways to "moonlight" on several of his own projects. In fact, within six months, he had applied for and received his very first patent. The invention was a beautifully designed and highly efficient electric vote-recording machine. However, when he tried to sell it, members of the Massachusetts Legislature thoroughly denigrated it, claiming "its speed in tallying votes would disrupt the political status-quo."
The specific problem was that - during times of stress - political bodies of the time often relied upon the brief delays that were provided by the process of manually counting votes to influence and "hopefully" change the opinions of their colleagues. "This is exactly what we do not want" a seasoned politician scolded him, adding that "Your invention would not only destroy the only hope the minority would have of influencing legislation, it would deliver them over - bound hand and foot - to the majority."
Although Tom was greatly disappointed by this turn of events, he immediately grasped its implications. Even though his remarkable invention allowed each voter to instantly cast his vote from his seat - exactly as it was supposed to do - he realized the idea was so far ahead of its time it was completely devoid of immediate sales appeal.
Because of his desperate need for money, Tom now made a critically significant adjustment in his, heretofore, relatively naive outlook on the world of business.... From this point forward, he vowed, he would "never waste time inventing things that people would not want to buy."
It is important to mention, here, that it was during Tom's 17 month stint in Boston that he was first exposed to lectures at Boston Tech (which was founded in 1861 and became the Mass. Institute of Technology in 1916) and the ideas of several associates on the state-of-the-art of "multiplexing" telegraph signals. This was the theory, and experimental quest, that involved the transmission of electrical impulses at different frequencies over telegraph wires, producing horn-like simulations of the human voice and even crude images (the first internet?) via an instrument called the harmonic telegraph.
Not surprisingly, both Edison and Alexander Graham Bell were fascinated by this exciting new area of electrical science - which eventually led to the invention of the first articulating telephone, the first fax machine, etc.
Interestingly, an acquaintance by the name of Benjamin Bredding, an obscure 21 year old genius who was the same age as Bell and Edison - and who later provided critically important assistance to Bell in perfecting long distance telephony as well as the first reciprocating telephone - now provided Edison extremely valuable input into heightening his understanding of the state-of-the-art of the harmonograph and the multiplex transmitter. Significantly, Bredding was the crack electrician who later set up the world's first two-way long distance telephone apparatus for his close friend Alexander Graham Bell, "who at the time knew almost nothing about electricity."
Copyrighted - never before published - tintype of Bredding and Bell in October of 1876 on the day they successfully communicated across Boston's Charles River in what was the world's first long distance two-way telephone conversation.
In any event, it was George B. Stearns who - with Bredding's help - eventually beat everyone to the punch when he obtained the first patent for a duplex telegraph line (a device that exploits the fact that electromagnetism and the number and direction of wire windings associated with a connection between telegraph keys can influence the current that flows between them....) and facilitated the first two-way telegraphic communication.
Stearns, who was Bredding's boss, finally sold the patent for this highly significant cost-cutting invention to Western Union for $750,000. Not surprisingly, Bredding and Edison wound up getting absolutely nothing from the venture. An interesting upshot was that, while the caprice associated with the rough and tumble world of patenting inventions in the mid-19th century ultimately crushed Bredding's innately mild spirit - along with his extraordinary potential - it merely spurred the tough minded Edison on to not only improve upon the duplex system but to later patent the world's first quadruplex transmitter....
Threatened with being fired for not concentrating on his primary responsibilities to Western Union - and deeply in debt - Edison now borrowed $35.00 from his fellow telegrapher and "night owl" pal, Benjamin Franklin Bredding, and purchased a steamship ticket to the more commercially oriented city of New York. (The money was returned a year later.)
During the third week after arriving in "the big apple" Tom was purportedly nearly starving to death. Then, one of the most amazing coincidences in the annals of technological history took place. Not long after having disparately begged for a cup of tea from a vendor "to stave off possible starvation," he happened to be meandering through an office in the financial district. Observing that manager of the brokerage firm was in some kind of a panic, he eventually learned that that a critically important stock-ticker had just broken down. Noting that none of those clustered around the machine had a clue on how to fix it, he elbowed his way into the scene and grasped the opportunity to have a go at addressing the problem himself....
Since Tom had been sleeping in the basement of the building for a few days - and doing quite a bit of snooping around - he already had a pretty good idea of what the device was supposed to do. After spending a few seconds confirming how it was intended to work in the first place, he quickly reached down and manipulated the end of a loose spring back to where it belonged.... and, to everyone's amazement, the ticker began to run perfectly.
The manager was so ecstatic, he made an on the spot decision to hire Edison to make similar repairs in the busy office for a salary of $300.00 per month.... This was far more than his friend, Benjamin Bredding, was making back in Boston and twice the going rate for a crack electrician in New York. Later in life, Edison would recall that the incident made him more euphoric than anything he ever experienced in his life because it was as though he "had been suddenly delivered from abject poverty to prosperity."
It should come as no surprise that, during his free time, Edison soon returned to his old habit of "moonlighting" on his job with the telegraph, the quadruplex transmitter, and the stock-ticker. And, shortly thereafter, he was absolutely astonished - in fact he nearly fainted - when a corporation paid him $40,000 for all of his rights to the latter device.
This was the first "real" money Edison had ever received for an invention. Convinced that no bank would honor the large check, he walked around for hours in a stupor, staring at it in disbelief. Dreadfully fearful someone that would steal it, he laid the cash out on his bed and stayed up all night counting and recounting in disbelief. The next day a wise friend told him to deposit it in a bank forthwith and to just forget about it for a while.
A few weeks later, Edison wrote a series of poignant letters back home to his father: "How is mother getting along?... I am now in a position to give you some cash... Write and say how much....Give mother anything she wants...."
Over the next few years, Edison's progress in creating successful inventions for industry really took off.... For example, in 1874 - with the money he received from the sale of an electrical engineering firm that held several of his patents - he opened his own laboratory in Newark, New Jersey. Then, at age 29, he commenced work on the carbon transmitter, which ultimately made Alexander Graham Bell's amazing new "articulating" telephone (which by today's standards sounded something like someone trying to talk through a kazoo) audible enough for practical use. Interestingly, at one point during this intense period, Edison was as close to inventing the telephone as Bell was to inventing the phonograph. Nevertheless, shortly after Edison moved his laboratory to Menlo Park, N.J. in 1876, it was he who invented - in 1877 - the first phonograph.
In 1879 - even though he was extremely disappointed by the fact that Bell had beaten him in the race to patent the first authentic transmission of the human voice - Edison now "one upped" all of his competition by inventing the first commercially practical incandescent electric light bulb...
And, if the above wasn't enough to forever seal his unequaled importance in technological history, he now came up with an invention that - in terms of its collective affect upon mankind - has had more impact than any other. In 1883 and 1884, while beating a path from his research lab to the patent office, he introduced the world's first economically viable system of centrally generating and distributing electric light, heat, and power. (See "Greatest Achievement?") Even his harshest critics grant that this was a Herculean world-shaking event that only he could have brought about at this specific point in history.
In 1887, Edison set up the world's first full fledged research and development center in West Orange, New Jersey. And, within a year, the operation grew to become the largest scientific testing laboratory in the world. In 1890, he immersed himself in developing the first silent motion pictures. And, by 1892, his Edison General Electric Co. had fully merged with another firm to become the great General Electric Corporation, in which he was a major stockholder.
At around the turn-of-the-century, Edison invented the first perfected dictaphone, mimeograph, and practical storage battery. Then, after creating the "kinetiscope" and the first silent film in 1904, he went on to introduce The Great Train Robbery in 1903, which was a ten minute clip that was his first attempt to blend audio with silent moving images to produce "talking pictures."
By now, Edison was being called "The wizard of Menlo Park" and "The father of the electrical age." So it should come as no surprise that when World War I began he was asked by the U. S. Government to help out by focusing his creativity upon creating defensive devices for submarines and ships. He also perfected a number of important inventions relating to rubber, concrete, ethanol, etc. at this time.
By the 1920s Edison was internationally revered. However - even though he was personally acquainted with scores of very important people of his era - he developed very few close friendships. Moreover, due to the demands of his career, there were long periods when he spent a shockingly small amount of time with his family.
It wasn't until his health began to fail, in his 80s, that Edison finally began to slow down and, so to speak, "smell the flowers." After obtaining his last (1,093rd) patent at age 83, he worked mostly at home where he greatly enjoyed greeting former associates and famous people such as Charles Lindberg, Marie Curie, Henry Ford, and President Herbert Hoover etc. He also enjoyed reading the mail of admirers and puttering around a few hours each day in his office and in his home lab.
Finally, because of the many peculiar voids that Edison often evinced in the area of cognition, a number of medical authorities have argued that he may have been plagued by a learning disability that went well beyond mere deafness.... Some of have even conjectured that this surmised ailment - along with his lack of a formal education - could explain why he always seemed to always "think so differently" compared to most others of his time, "tenaciously clinging to those unique methods of analysis and experimentation with which he alone seemed to feel so comfortable...."
Whatever the impetus for the above trait, his incredible ability to come up with a meaningful new patent every two weeks throughout his working career "added more to the collective wealth of the world - and had more impact upon shaping modern civilization - than the accomplishments of any figure since Gutenberg...." Accordingly, most science and technology historians grant that he was indeed "The most influential figure of our millennium."
Thomas Edison died At 9 PM On Oct. 18th, 1931 in New Jersey. He was 84 years of age. Recognizing that his death marked the end of an era in the progress of civilization, countless individuals, communities, and corporations throughout the world dimmed their lights and, or, briefly shut down their power to honor him on the evening of the day that he was laid to rest on his beautiful estate at at Glenmont New Jersey. Apparently, they also recognized that - while he was certainly not a flawless human being - he was an essentially good man with a powerful mission; a man who was driven by a superhuman desire to research and invent things to serve mankind.
In 1962 his existing laboratory and home in West Orange, N.J. were designated as National Historic Sites.

Dubai joins elite top five hubs in latest International Shipping Centre Development Index - used a methodology assessing the sector’s competitiveness, ability to attract maritime businesses, development of efforts in relation to creativity and innovation, and key role in advancing growth of the global shipping sector - thus resulting the first Arab city to join the ranks of Singapore, Hong Kong, London and Shanghai
The UAE city has reached this new milestone in its strategy for leadership in the international maritime sector after being selected as one of the world's top five hubs in the International Shipping Centre Development Index (ISCD).
Backed by legal and legislative excellence, Dubai is known for its advanced infrastructure, world-class maritime and logistics capabilities--a competitive environment conducive to trade, business and investment, and innovative free zones that match the world’s best.
According to a recent report by London-based Baltic Exchange and the Xinhua News Agency, Dubai has secured fifth position and overtaken Hamburg, which fell from fourth to seventh place, while Rotterdam improved from eighth to sixth, having previously occupied the top five positions between 2014 and 2016. The ranking confirms anew the emirate’s reputation as one of the leading maritime shipping and logistics centers in the world.
The emirate is on track to make unprecedented achievements under the relentless support of H. H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, who envisioned a safe, integrated, and sustainable maritime sector in support of the UAE’s economic diversification policy in preparation for a post-oil future.
Dubai’s entry into the ISCD’s top five brought a major responsibility to further develop the legislative, regulatory and logistics infrastructure to highest international standards of operational efficiency, maritime safety, and safe navigation in a bid to attract foreign direct investments, in line with objectives of the Dubai Plan 2021 to make the emirate one of the most important business centers in the world.
Founded in 2007, Dubai Maritime City Authority (DMCA) has brought about a radical change in the local maritime sector through an extensive range of industry initiatives and regulations which support its ambitious approach to creating a safe investment environment for industry leaders from all over the world, while reaffirming Dubai’s position as a first-class international maritime hub.
Established to monitor, develop and promote maritime activities, DMCA provides a platform of excellence and quality as it develops world-class regulations and guidelines to raise the bar on the maritime industry and boost its infrastructure, operations and logistics services while offering investment opportunities to boost Dubai’s competitiveness at the regional and international levels.

Verina Gfader: To start our conversation I would like to address your current sites of activity and their economies. You recently left ICC to continue working as an independent curator — where do you see its potential within current Japanese economies and the role of (media) art spaces, where and how art takes place? Is there a desire to be 'outside' the institution which perhaps assumes a more protective environment?
Yukiko Shikata: I left ICC after working there for five and a half years. I curated many thematic exhibitions and events and I thought it was time to restart my activities, because I felt the moment of a fundamental shift now in the second decade of the 21C. The ways of communicating are drastically changing, via social networking systems such as twitter, or Ustream+twitter, where the borders between the private/public, here/there, mass media/micro media, etc. are blurred, and the identity is getting multi-layered and connective. Being aware of these situations, I see the new emergence of media arts by creatively combining art, science, and technology, and I would like to work for stimulating the future culture and society, by actualizing the creative potential of people across fields. For this, my role is to change flexibly depending on each project, ranging from small events, continuous R&D, big exhibitions and projects in and out of Japan at this moment.
Thinking about the current economical situation in Japan and all over the world, art and cultural activities are in crisis, and I see the supporting structure for art could possibly come not from a single sponsor (such as from one company), but from several sponsors beyond companies, foundations, and individuals beyond nations. I expect the emergence of a new economy in the age of digital networks, with shared information and knowledge created by the people. The creators will carry out more direct distribution of their creations, and there will be more sustainable "on-demand"-based money exchanges. These new kinds of creation and distribution will lead to new cultural value, and the new cultural value will lead us to new economic value. This is my hope and what I am heading for.
I used to call myself a "mediator" or "agency" these past five years, but recently I started to call my mission "Curating the Future", by intentionally expanding the word "curating" into disseminating creative thinking beyond culture, science, society, etc. Sometimes I bridge, and create links and relations between the people and fields for the projects and exhibitions, and sometimes let them free to communicate with each other as something that would start someday in the future. I see some of the seeds of the past several years starting to bloom, recently in the form of various kinds of collaboration -- projects, workshops and spaces. Additionally, I started several small activities including Open Lab. within the frame of my lecture class at the Tokyo Zokei University. At Open Lab., I and two mature students (who recently opened an alternative space in Tokyo downtown), as incubators, stimulate the students to start autonomous research projects, and we open my class three times per semester to present progress and for further discussions. As a starter, we did two events out of class recently, one is the open "connecting party" with the president of the University in his room, and the other is the "Urban Picnic" fieldwork which is a to walk around Tokyo downtown to reach the alternative spaces of the students. We open it to anybody who is interested, to join the workshop and to collaborate, and also we utilize the Ustream+twitter to stream realtime for further interaction. So now two new research groups are born, and I look forward to seeing the progress.
In general, there are many artist- and curator-run alternative spaces emerging recently, and they are actively communicating with other spaces. Many interactions both in real and virtual spaces activate the scene, and I would like to connect them with the official cultural institutes, research centers and organisations, museums and art centers.
VG: Shifting our dialogue from the action, to how cultural activities and practices are entangled with the question of preserving them: when we met in summer 2009, you talked about how in Japan, body and technology are quite 'naturally' linked, technology is not an alienating device. Japanese people are looking for the new, as life is based on transformation and the fleeting (referring to the Buddhist tradition). There is no desire for building permanence, as in Europe for example, or thinking a "permanent situation". This led into questions of archiving, forms of documents, and memory. You mentioned that the idea is not to establish a "whole archive" (mega-archive) as desired in the West, memories are personal, and remain personal, in this sense there is a 'fragmented archive'. In the Japanese context there is no aim to build this shared big archive. My questions are about media and archiving, how to preserve work, or what to preserve? Do institutions archive at all, and in what way?
YS: In Japan and most of the Asian countries, there is no strong desire for the "construction" or "overview", like in the West. I think the European notions of "construction" and "overview" are established on the premise of the Cartesian notion (and notation) of space, and "chronos", the notion of time, and in Asian countries time and space were not articulated in this Western way. Especially in Japan, we live in the environment of ever-changing nature (four seasons, typhoon, etc.), and this makes the Japanese to flexibly adjust to the phenomena, and even to interpenetrate with them. But, after modernization we Japanese took the Western method, and now in the age of global networks, we confront the various values from different cultures... so, I think it is the time for the Japanese to be aware of being multi-perspectival, including the way of self-articulation and reflection.
Regarding the practical notion of archiving: we are aware of building the archive, by taking the modern Western method of "mega-archive", but the history, cultural and budgetary reasons do not easily let us to build a stable, continuous system to preserve the data for the archive. At the same time, we confront the future of archiving in the age of digital networks. The whole notion and system of "archive" should be reconsidered beyond cultures and countries, and there will be no one, universal state of "archive", but there will be more de-centralized, multi-perspective approaches to the archive. The digitally networked archive with social tagging by people's participation would be one of the actual, significant forms of archives.
Answering your question on preserving media art more directly: each media art work is different, some are stored physically and some are preserved only by data. Hardwares, softwares change rapidly over time, and becoming obsolete, and many works would be difficult to be shown in a proper way as time goes by. I think it is very difficult to keep the work function as it used to be, so the "documentation" of the work by video and sound (like performance pieces, because most of media art works are time-based, experience-based) would be the most fundamental way for archiving.
VG: To reflect back in time... I am interested in your entrance to media / art, what was relevant to you at that time? What are the original aims and ideas in your practice? My question relates to your work at Canon, and YCAM/Yamaguchi Center for Arts and Media, with Kazunao Abe.
YS: I came into this field by encountering Joseph Beuys in 1982. I was very impressed by his ideas and attitudes, and the fluidity of his works, including what he described and understood as "Social Sculpture" and "Everybody is an artist". It keeps me encouraged and stimulated even now, and I would say that all of my activities -- especially "MobLab"(2005), "open nature" (2005), and "Mission G: sensing the earth" (2009) -- fundamentally come from an ongoing re-interpretation of Beuys's activities.
I was also influenced by Nam June Paik, and in the mid 80s, by the activities of OCEAN EARTH (Peter Fend, Ingo Gunther), all of them are in a way "outsiders" (they were originally not specialized in art, but then became artists), they take some distance to the existing notion of art, and have a keen sense of combining art and technology with a socio-cultural approach. I take a very similar stance. Since the mid 80s, I am very interested in art in relation to technology from critical perspectives, and started to write on the issue, and started curating. Then, in 1990, I got an offer to be co-curator at Canon ARTLAB to collaborate with artists and Canon's computer engineers, and we co-curators (me and Kazunao Abe, currently the artistic director of YCAM/Yamaguchi Center for Arts and Media) took the direction to do experiments in producing new works of media art. At Canon ARTLAB, my curatorial direction was to focus on "process", "flow", "algorithmic" based organization of information beyond analog/digital, micro/macro, and to produce a system, platform or space for public interaction -- in opposite of being a "narrative" "representative" expression -- this (my curatorial) direction was established in the 90s, by collaborating with artists such as Ulrike Gabriel, Knowbotic Research, Teiji Furuhashi, Seiko Mikami, and Carsten Nicolai+Marko Peljhan.
VG: The issue of continuation and duration seems to re-occur — at the time I visited ICC you presented a stage of the longterm project "Mission G: sensing the earth", as part of Open Space 2009. In relation to projects that develop over time and research based curating, here addressing themes of the territorial and mapping, what difficulties do you experience in your curatorial practice with regard to these works in process (maintaining the process)? What are the potentials? Concept based curating, that allows you to work with artworks horizontally (non-linear) and that allows for making 'new' connections, is this a methodology driven by ideas?
YS: "Mission G: sensing the earth" exhibition (ICC, May 16, 2009 - February 28, 2010) had a long-term duration, and I consciously utilized that. I was very interested in the recent situation, the global diffusion of DIY & open source approaches to hardware and software, and how many individuals had started to measure the environmental data and share it. The local data are connected to becoming global. Anything in daily life and the environment can be sensed and visualized. I was also very interested in the possibility of a new emergence of information, by the continuous micro-activities of each bit of information, without setting any strict goals. Also, through the emergence of sensing on a micro-level, by sharing, visualizing, and perceiving the form of the globe, there might emerge a new consciousness for us to share the earth, by self-reflection. I think the importance of the singular artist/creator will stay, but I certainly see the emergence of other layers in artistic creation and distribution based on the "shared" culture, so that the existing way of expression could be repositioned.
The exhibition consisted of 5 projects beyond art, science and architecture, and the whole space was made for the works to co-exist, and even with some relations between the works (sending data to the other work). The whole space looked very calm, there was no clear interaction by the visitors, because all the works were in operation getting the environmental data from many places in the world, including satellites outside of ICC, and visualized in realtime. The whole exhibition gradually changed according to the environmental data. The visitors could feel close to the "environment" during their stay in the exhibition, and after leaving there, they will be more aware about the daily environment -- natural and informational -- around them.
The "Mission G: sensing the earth" asks the question of "observation", "calculation", and "visualization" in the age of digital technology. The trans-coding process from the numerical into the visual and perceivable data, shows us the optional features in dealing with data in observation systems. In the observation, additionally many "filters" exist - such as observation systems, observation devices and their mechanisms, the accuracy of the measuring device, the ways of analysis, visualization, and notation. Any measurement, analysis, and visualization are part of the "filters". Being conscious about that, we are now heading for the new horizon of measurement, and I would like to call it "Micrometry". In "Micrometry", each individual keeps measuring and feeding the environmental data by her/his own interest and without having a unified perspective or goal, this is a micro-, autonomous- behavior. I think this is what is happening now also in our society.
It might be understood as a perspective beyond "humans". There are the decentralized, time-based special projection by Hajime Narukawa’s "AUTHAGRAPH", "Dust Architecture" coined by dNA (doubleNegatives Architecture), that keeps transforming being influenced by an ever-changing environment, by connecting "nodes (Super Eye)" with Polar Coordinate, and "Pachube" as the network of local-, micro-information. A dynamically shared information platform would emerge beyond marginal micro data and perception, by getting connected and cooperating with each other. It is not "visually-represented" but rather "tactile", and originates in a micro and personal stance. The "Earth" being generated in the "Mission G" exhibition is based bottom-up, an ever-changing dynamic one, and open in the information process to go beyond the static way of space representation by existing maps and notation systems. And I think this "micrometry" is happening also in our mental spaces via the communication mediated such as by twitter. "Mission G" stays important for me and I will keep on investigating it.

A "handler" is an internal Apache representation of the action to be performed when a file is called. Generally, files have implicit handlers, based on the file type. Normally, all files are simply served by the server, but certain file types are "handled" separately.
Handlers may also be configured explicitly, based on either filename extensions or on location, without relation to file type. This is advantageous both because it is a more elegant solution, and because it also allows for both a type and a handler to be associated with a file. (See also Files with Multiple Extensions.)
Handlers can either be built into the server or included in a module, or they can be added with the Action directive. The built-in handlers in the standard distribution are as follows:
The following directives will cause requests for files with the html extension to trigger the launch of the footer.pl CGI script.
Then the CGI script is responsible for sending the originally requested document (pointed to by the PATH_TRANSLATED environment variable) and making whatever modifications or additions are desired.
The following directives will enable the send-as-is handler, which is used for files which contain their own HTTP headers. All files in the /web/htdocs/asis/ directory will be processed by the send-as-is handler, regardless of their filename extensions.
In order to implement the handler features, an addition has been made to the Apache API that you may wish to make use of. Specifically, a new record has been added to the request_rec structure:
If you wish to have your module engage a handler, you need only to set r->handler to the name of the handler at any time prior to the invoke_handler stage of the request. Handlers are implemented as they were before, albeit using the handler name instead of a content type. While it is not necessary, the naming convention for handlers is to use a dash-separated word, with no slashes, so as to not invade the media type name-space.
This is not a Q&A section. Comments placed here should be pointed towards suggestions on improving the documentation or server, and may be removed again by our moderators if they are either implemented or considered invalid/off-topic. Questions on how to manage the Apache HTTP Server should be directed at either our IRC channel, #httpd, on Freenode, or sent to our mailing lists.

Fire safety inspections are conducted by the Bremerton Fire Department Fire Prevention office yearly. Every business in every building is inspected using the International Fire Code as a standard. The State of Washington has adopted the International Codes as the "Model Codes" to follow for "Prescriptive" code issues. There are several different examples of model codes. One is the Uniform Fire Code, which the State of Washington utilized for many years.
The State of Washington has adopted the entire International Code Set, with the exception of the Plumbing Code. The State of Washington still utilizes the Uniform Plumbing Code.
During the adoption of each code (Fire code, Building Code, Mechanical Code, etc.) the state can pick and choose which areas to adopt or can "re-write" what they want that section or code to say. These changes are available online.
Once the state has adopted the Model Code of their choice, each municipality and county will adopt the same code, but are first allowed to make more restrictive changes to areas, which they have selected. The appendixes of the codes are for informational purposes only, unless they have been adopted by the governmental agency for that area. Once an appendix has been adopted, it carries the same weight as the code itself. In many areas of the IFC, as with other model codes, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) is referenced for item specific expertise. For example NFPA 72 is the standard for fire alarm systems. This document is very technical and details out every issue with a fire alarm. Any questions can be answered about a fire alarm between the IFC chapter on "Fire Protection Systems" and NFPA 72.
The City of Bremerton's changes to the International Fire Code (IFC) are contained in Chapter 18 of the Bremerton Municipal Code (BMC). City of Bremerton has also adopted all of the appendixes.
All businesses, churches, schools and residential buildings of 3 or more units on a single parcel are inspected annually by the Bremerton Fire Marshal's Office. Here are some of the things they look for:

1 13.4 Ways of Expressing Concentration All methods involve quantifying the amount of solute per amount of solvent (or solution). Concentration may be expressed qualitatively or quantitatively. The terms dilute and concentrated are qualitative ways to describe concentration. A dilute solution has a relatively small concentration of solute. A concentrated solution has a relatively high concentration of solute. Quantitative expressions of concentration require specific information regarding such quantities as masses, moles, or liters of the solute, solvent, or solution. The most commonly used expressions for concentration are: Mass percentage Mole fraction Molarity Molality Mass percentage, ppm, and ppb Mass percentage is one of the simplest ways to express concentration. By definition: mass of component in soln Mass % of component = 100 total mass of solution Similarly, parts per million (ppm) can be expressed as the number of mg of solute per kilogram of solution. By definition: mass of component in soln 6 Parts per million (ppm) of component = 10 total mass of solution If the density of the solution is 1g/ml, then 1 ppm = 1 mg solute per liter of solution. We can extend this again! Parts per billion (ppb) can be expressed as the number of µg of solute per kilogram of solution. By definition: mass of component in soln 9 Parts per billion (ppb) of component = 10 total mass of solution If the density of the solution is 1g/ml, then 1 ppb = 1 µg solute per liter of solution
2 Sample Exercise 13.4 (p. 542) a) A solution is made by dissolving 13.5 g glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) in kg of water. What is the mass percentage of solute in this solution? (11.9%) b) A 2.5-g sample of groundwater was found to contain 5.4 µg of Zn 2+. What is the concentration of Zn 2+ in parts per million? (2.2 ppm) Practice Exercise 13.4 a) Calculate the mass percentage of NaCl in a solution containing 1.50 g of NaCl in 50.0 g of water. (2.91%) b) A commercial bleaching solution contains 3.62 mass % sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl. What is the mass of NaOCl in a bottle containing 2500 g of bleaching solution? (90.5 g NaOCl) - 2 -
3 Mole Fraction, Molarity, and Molality Common expressions of concentration are based on the number of moles of one or more components. Recall that mass can be converted to moles using the molar mass. Recall: molesof component Mole fraction of component, X = total molesof all components Note: Mole fraction has no units. Note: Mole fractions range from 0 to 1. Recall: moles of solute Molarity, M = liters of solution Note: Molarity will change with a change in temperature (as the solution volume increases or decreases). We can define molality (m), yet another concentration unit: Molality, m = moles of solute kilograms of solvent Molality does not vary with temperature. Note: converting between molarity (M) and molality (m) requires density
4 Sample Exercise 13.5 (p. 544) A solution is made by dissolving 4.35 g glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) in 25.0 ml of water. Calculate the molality of glucose in the solution. (0.964 m) Practice Exercise 13.5 What is the molality of a solution made by dissolving 36.5 g of naphthalene (C 10 H 8 ) in 425 g of toluene (C 7 H 8 )? (0.670 m) Sample Exercise 13.6 (p. 544) A solution of hydrochloric acid contains 36% HCl by mass. a) Calculate the mole fraction of HCl in the solution. (0.22) b) Calculate the molality of HCl in the solution. (15 m) Practice Exercise 13.6 A commercial bleach solution contains 3.62 mass % NaOCl in water. Calculate a) the mole fraction of NaOCl in the solution and (9.00 x 10-3 ) b) the molality of NaOCl in the solution (0.505 m) - 4 -
6 13.5 Colligative Properties Colligative properties depend on number of solute particles. Colligative properties are physical properties. There are four colligative properties to consider: Vapor pressure lowering (Raoult's Law). Boiling point elevation. Freezing point depression. Osmotic pressure. 1. Lowering the Vapor Pressure # particles vapor pressure e.g. pure H 2 O vs. H 2 O + NaCl (salt water) higher V.P. lower V.P. Why? 1) Na + + Cl - particles (nonvolatile solutes) get surrounded by H 2 O fewer free H 2 O particles left to vaporize at surface 2) IMFs harder to get out Figure Vapor-pressure lowering. The vapor pressure over a solution formed by a volatile solvent and a nonvolatile solute (b) is lower than that of the solvent alone (a). The extent of the decrease in the vapor pressure upon addition of the solute depends on the concentration of the solute. Raoult s law quantifies the extent to which a nonvolatile solute lowers the vapor pressure of the solvent. If P A is the vapor pressure with solute, P o A is the vapor pressure of the pure solvent, and X A is the mole fraction of A, then o P = Χ P A A A - 6 -
7 Ideal solution: one that obeys Raoult s law. Real solutions show approximately ideal behavior when: The solute concentration is low. The solute and solvent have similarly sized molecules. The solute and solvent have similar types of intermolecular attractions. Raoult s law breaks down when the solvent-solvent and solute-solute intermolecular forces are >> or << solute-solvent IMFs. NEW - optional Sample Exercise 13.8 (p. 547) Glycerin (C 3 H 8 O 3 ) is a nonvolatile nonelectrolyte with a density of 1.25 g/ml at 25 o C. Calculate the vapor pressure at 25 o C of a solution made by adding 50.0 ml of glycerin to ml of water. The vapor pressure of pure water at 25 o C is 23.8 torr. (23.2 torr) Practice Exercise 13.8 The vapor pressure of pure water at 110 o C is 1070 torr. A solution of ethylene glycol and water has a vapor pressure of 1.00 atm at 110 o C. Assuming that Raoult s law is obeyed, what is the mole fraction of ethylene glycol in the solution? (0.290) 2. Boiling Point Elevation # particles of nonvolatile solute VP boiling point Since boiling point is when VP = atmospheric pressure, if the V.P. is lower, then more energy must be used to overcome atmospheric pressure and reach 1 atm = higher T at boiling It takes more energy to break apart solvent/solute bonds so solvent can vaporize. H 2 O: 1 mole particles = o C 1 kg H 2 O molal boiling-point-elevation constant, K b, expresses how much T b changes with molality, m: T b = K b m The boiling-point elevation is proportional to [solute particles]. A 1 m solution of NaCl is 2 m in total solute particles
8 3. Freezing Point Depression # particles freezing point When a solution freezes, crystals of almost pure solvent are formed first. Solute molecules are usually not soluble in the solid phase of the solvent. the triple point occurs at a lower T because of the lower VP for the solution. The melting-point (freezing-point) curve is a vertical line from the triple point. the solution freezes at a lower temperature ( T f ) than the pure solvent. The in freezing point ( T f ) is directly proportional to molality, i.e. [solute particles]. K f = molal freezing-point-depression constant. T f = K f m Boiling point: T b = K b m i Boiling Point/Freezing Point Calculations Change in specific molal concentration i = # particles upon boiling T for each of solution dissociation of solute solvent Freezing point: T f = K f m i Change in freezing T - 8 -
10 Sample Exercise (p. 551) List the following aqueous solutions in order of their expected freezing points: m CaCl 2 ; 0.15 m HCl; m HC 2 H 3 O 2 ; 0.10 m C 12 H 22 O 11. Practice Exercise Which of the following solutes will produce the largest increase in boiling point upon addition of 1 kg of water: 1 mol Co(NO 3 ) 2, 2 mol of KCl, 3 mol of ethylene glycol (C 2 H 6 O 2 )? (2 mol KCl) Osmosis Osmosis = the net movement of a solvent from an area of low [solute] to an area of high [solute] across a semipermeable membrane, e.g. cell membranes and cellophane
11 Osmotic pressure, π, is the pressure required to prevent osmosis. Osmotic pressure obeys a law similar in form to the ideal-gas law. For n moles, V= volume, M= molarity, R= the ideal gas constant, and an absolute temperature, T, the osmotic pressure is: πv = nrt π = n V RT = MRT Two solutions are said to be isotonic if they have the same osmotic pressure. Hypotonic solutions have a lower π, relative to a more concentrated solution. Hypertonic solutions have a higher π, relative to a more dilute solution. Sample Exercise (p. 553) The average osmotic pressure of blood is 7.7 atm at 25 o C. What concentration of glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6 ) will be isotonic with blood? (0.31 M) Practice Exercise What is the osmotic pressure at 20 o C of a M sucrose (C 12 H 22 O 11 ) solution? (0.048 atm or 37 torr)
12 Determination of Molar Mass Any of the four colligative properties may be used to determine molar mass. Sample Exercise (p. 555) A solution of an unknown nonvolatile nonelectrolyte was prepared by dissolving g of the substance in 40.0 g of CCl 4. The boiling point of the resultant solution was o C higher than that of the pure solvent. Calculate the molar mass of the solute. (88.0 g/mol) Practice Exercise Camphor (C 10 H 16 O) melts at o C, and it has a particularly large freezing-point-depression constant, K f = 40.0 o C/m. When g of an organic substance of unknown molar mass is dissolved in g of liquid camphor, the freezing point of the mixture is found to be o C. What is the molar mass of the solute? (110 g/mol) Sample Exercise (p. 556) The osmotic pressure of an aqueous solution of a certain protein was measured in order to determine its molar mass. The solution contained 3.50 mg of protein dissolved in sufficient water to form 5.00 ml of solution. The osmotic pressure of the solution at 25 o C was found to be 1.54 torr. Calculate the molar mass of the protein. (8.45 x 10 3 g/mol)
13 Practice Exercise A sample of 2.05 g of the plastic polystyrene was dissolved in enough toluene to form L of solution. The osmotic pressure of this solution was found to be 1.21 kpa at 25 o C. Calculate the molar mass of the polystyrene. (4.20 x 10 4 g/mol) 13.6 Colloids Colloids or colloidal dispersions are suspensions in which the suspended particles are larger than molecules but too small to separate out of the suspension due to gravity. Particle size: 5 to 1000 nm. Tyndall effect: ability of colloidal particles to scatter light. The path of a beam of light projected through a colloidal suspension can be seen through the suspension
14 Sample Integrative Exercise 13 (p. 560) A L solution is made by dissolving g of CaCl 2(s) in water. a) Calculate the osmotic pressure of this solution at 27 o C, assuming that it is completely dissociated into its component ions. (2.93 atm) b) The measured osmotic pressure of this solution is 2.56 atm at 27 o C. Explain why it is less than the value calculated in (a), and calculate the van t Hoff factor, i, for the solute in this solution. (2.62) c) The enthalpy of solution for CaCl 2 is H = kj/mol. If the final temperature of the solution was 27.0 o C, what was its initial temperature? (Assume that the density of the solution is 1.00 g/ml, that its specific heat is 4.18 J/g-K, and that the solution loses no heat to its surroundings.) (26.2 o C) (don t worry if you have trouble with this one we will work on thermodynamics next semester)

5 , 2 nd Ed. Preface to the Second Edition In 2004, The Soap and Detergent Association (SDA; now the American Cleaning Institute) published as a guide for companies engaged in stewardship of consumer products with repeated human exposures or environmental releases, especially via down-the-drain disposal. Included in the publication were several examples based on SDA s experience in the US EPA and OECD high production volume (HPV) chemical programs. Since the initial publication, several of the submissions for particular chemical categories sponsored by SDA have been completed and accepted by the relevant HPV chemical program, and peer-reviewed journal articles have been published for those cases. The second edition, re-titled Consumer Product Ingredient Safety: to highlight the broader applicability of the publication, contains updated information on exposure assessment methodology as well as finalized case studies and the final manuscripts of the peer-reviewed articles as appendixes. The following contributed significantly to the development of this document: The SDA High Production Volume Chemicals Task Force; the Personal Care Products Council (formerly the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association); the Consumer Specialty Products Association; the European Cosmetic Toiletry and Perfumery Association; the Human and Environmental Risk Assessment project; Exponent; and the Danish National Environmental Research Institute. A panel of international experts conducted a peer review which provided very helpful input in finalizing the document. v

R (product retained on skin): A parameter used in the screening-level exposure equation for the direct dermal baby bath liquid scenario. This parameter refers to the amount of product remaining on the baby s skin after use of the product. This parameter is very similar to the PR parameter; however, it is presented in terms of mg product remaining /cm 2 body surface area. reasonable worst case: A semi-quantitative term referring to the lower portion of the high end of the exposure, dose, or risk distribution. The reasonable worst case has historically been loosely defined, including synonymously with maximum exposure or worst case. As a semi-quantitative term, it is sometimes useful to refer to individual exposures, doses, or risks that, while in the high end of the distribution, are not in the extreme tail. reference dose (RfD): An estimate of the daily exposure to the human population that is likely to be without appreciable risk of deleterious non-cancer effects during a lifetime. screening information data set (SIDS): A data set consisting of general information on a chemical s production, use patterns, physical and chemical characteristics (particularly those that might suggest how and to what extent people might become exposed,) and its fate in the environment.

15 , 2 nd Ed. 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Aim and Audience The consumer products industry has exposure information and screening methods that can be of value in viewing chemical hazard data from an exposure perspective and thereby facilitate prioritization of chemicals for further risk evaluation, as appropriate. The industry s unique consumer exposure information, which is based on the formulation and use of consumer products, is presented in this book and is recommended for use in risk screening analysis. The main purpose of this book is to present methodologies and specific consumer exposure information that can be used for screening-level risk assessments of environmental and human exposures to high production volume (HPV) chemicals through the manufacturing and use of consumer products, mainly laundry, cleaning, and personal care products. The approach can be applied generally to other consumer products when information on how consumers use the products is available. These methodologies allow hazard information to be put into context by using exposure information to characterize risk. Screeninglevel risk assessments are useful for prioritizing the need for further work. Several ongoing chemical management programs globally are focusing on both legacy and HPV chemicals. This book compiles data and methods, illustrated using examples from these global programs, that can be a useful resource for prioritizing compounds. Because of the large numbers of chemicals under investigation in global chemical management programs, a specific need for category assessments the main focus of this book exists. The intended audience is chemical risk assessors in government agencies, businesses, and stakeholder groups who have experience in the area of consumer product exposure (PE) and risk assessment and are responsible for prioritizing chemical safety reviews. The book is produced by the American Cleaning Institute (ACI; formerly, the Soap and Detergent Association) in collaboration with its partners and member companies. ACI is a U.S. national trade association representing the formulators of household, institutional, and industrial cleaning products and the manufacturers of the ingredients and finished packaging used to bring these products to the marketplace. Under a major SDA/ACI program, the Association manages the efforts of over 60 companies within ten U.S. and global HPV chemical consortia to meet their commitment to compile and make publicly available a baseline set of health and environmental effects data covering almost 300 chemicals. SDA/ACI prepared more than 6,100 study summaries from existing hazard data. Only eight of the study summaries were based on new testing (about 0.13% of the total number of studies); the rest were provided by the companies and the scientific literature Background on the SDA/ACI HPV Chemical Program Soaps, detergents, and personal care products, like other consumer products, are sold in large quantities across the globe. Consequently, the main chemical ingredients in these products are often high volume chemicals. The products are used either directly (e.g., bar soap, body moisturizers) or indirectly (e.g., via washing and laundry) on the consumer s skin. After these products are used, residual ingredients are washed directly down the drain toward the municipal wastewater treatment plant and from there are released into the aquatic environment with the wastewater treatment plant effluent. This use-and-release pattern places an extraordinary responsibility on producers to understand and document the consumer and environmental exposure and safety of the products and their ingredients. ACI represents its more than 60 member and non-member companies in voluntary HPV chemical programs, and has coordinated the preparation of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s (OECD s) Screening 1
16 , 2 nd Ed. Information Data Set (SIDS) program Initial Assessment Reports (SIARs) for seven categories of chemicals for the global industry: 1. Aliphatic acids (sponsored by Italy) 2. Amine oxides (sponsored by the United States) 3. Fatty acid methyl esters (industry sponsored) 4. Hydrotropes (sponsored by Australia) 5. Aliphatic alcohols (sponsored by the United Kingdom) 6. Alkyl sulfates, alkane sulfonates and α-olefin sulfonates (sponsored by Germany) 7. Glycerides (industry sponsored) In addition, SDA/ACI sponsored three categories of chemicals under the U.S. EPA HPV Challenge Program: 1. Aluminum alkoxides 2. Linear and branched alkylbenzene sulfonic acids and derivatives 3. Triclocarban These chemicals have a wide range of uses, including, for example, soaps and detergents; disinfectants, sanitizers, and household pest controls; cosmetics, fragrances, and personal care products; food and food additives; automotive care products; and polishes. The scope of the SIARs includes both human and environmental health exposure and hazard evaluations as each relates to the production and use of nearly 300 chemicals grouped into ten categories that SDA/ACI manages. It is generally recognized that during the chemical manufacturing, product formulation, and use and disposal of these products, some human exposures and environmental releases will occur. Human exposure can be both direct and indirect. There can be both occupational exposure and exposure due to use of consumer products. Environmental releases to air, water, and land might occur during the manufacture, processing or formulating, and use of the chemical or product. Multiple steps are required to prepare a SIAR. The initial step in the SIAR process involves assembling the available hazard data (i.e., physicochemical properties, environmental fate, ecotoxicity, and mammalian toxicity) and preparing a summary document for each chemical category as well as an Assessment Plan, as prescribed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) HPV Challenge Program ( and by the EPA Chemical Management Program ( exposure and risk screening methods presented in this book can be used to prioritize further assessment of chemicals under these programs. The second step is a global effort to gather and summarize available production, use, and exposure information for the same families of chemicals. The information gathered includes: annual production volumes by region (North America, Europe, Asia/Pacific); use categories and/or functions; pounds/kilos of chemical for each use category and/or function; physical form of the product(s); likely sources of exposure, including occupational (manufacturing and commercial use), consumer use, and indirect (via food, water, and air); 2
17 , 2 nd Ed. recommended workplace exposure limits and/or controls in place; sources of potential releases to the environment; relevant routes of human exposure by use category and/or function; and modeling and/or monitoring data on human exposure and on releases to air, water, and land. The hazard information, along with the use and exposure information, is summarized in the SIAR, which includes a recommendation that either (1) the chemical (or category) is currently a low priority for followup work, except for periodic review, or (2) the chemical is a candidate for further work. In recognition of the extra responsibility of the cleaning products industry in being stewards of the chemicals used in their products in terms of the volumes, direct consumer application, and down-thedrain disposal pathway ACI created this book to describe screening-level methodologies that assist in the priority-setting process by integrating exposure information with chemicals hazard data to characterize the risks posed by exposures. The approaches may be considered for use in national, regional, and intergovernmental chemicals management programs. For further data and information, please visit the ACI Science website at Background on Screening-Level Risk Assessments for Priority Setting Screening-level risk assessments are typically used to prioritize chemicals for future work on the basis of their hazards and exposure potential. These screens use readily available exposure information and simple models based on first-principle equations that are generally used by the scientific and regulatory communities. Conservative default assumptions are integrated into the screens to compensate for gaps in the data and uncertainties. The assumptions are deliberately designed to be conservative in order to avoid risk decisions based on false negatives. 1 Consequently, screening estimates of releases, exposure, and risks are conservative and often higher than actual values reported (Pittinger et al. 2003). More refined assessments can be conducted, if warranted. The refined assessments are designed to closely simulate a particular exposure scenario and thus require more detailed chemical-, site-, and receptorspecific data and use fewer default conservative assumptions. Screening tools that prioritize chemicals for further work can include: those based on readily available information on the intrinsic properties of the chemical (e.g., physicochemical properties and toxicity; see the EPA s Estimation Programs Interface (EPI) Suite, and the OECD s (Q)SAR toolbox, databases of quantities of chemicals released into the environment (e.g., Toxic Release Inventory, and a combination of these two as well as assessments that integrate the available hazard data with more sophisticated exposure estimates based on mathematical model predictions. In general, because screening-level risk assessments are less resource intensive or costly, they serve as an efficient means of categorizing and prioritizing those chemicals that either warrant more tailored and detailed assessments or are of no concern and can be put aside. The group Chemical Awareness (CA) developed two assessment frameworks that focus on a screeninglevel approach to inform priority setting for HPV chemicals: Framework for Evaluation of High 1 In this context, false negative means that exposure and risk estimates are lower than their actual levels. 3
18 , 2 nd Ed. Production Volume (HPV) Chemicals for Human Exposure and Risk (2002) and Framework for Evaluation of High Production Volume (HPV) Chemicals for Potential Ecological Exposure and Risk (2002); for a summary of the two frameworks, see Appendix IV. The frameworks provide a stepwise approach for assessing potential exposure and risks posed by HPV chemicals to relevant human and ecological receptors. Figure 1-1 presents the CA generic exposure framework, starting with a broad general evaluation and, as appropriate, proceeding to a more specific detailed evaluation. Figure 1-1. Generic Exposure Framework The following questions are addressed in the framework: When, during commerce, could people or the environment be exposed to chemicals manufacturing, distributing, formulating, end use, disposal? What are the plausible routes for exposure via industrial facilities, products, and/or dispersed environmental sources? 4
19 , 2 nd Ed. What is the magnitude of exposure for key routes, either separately or in aggregate, as appropriate? How does the exposure level or concentration compare to the relevant hazard effect level or concentration? What decisions can be recommended about further work on the chemical low priority, needs further evaluation, risk management? This book presents more specific exposure information and methodologies that can be used for screeninglevel risk assessments for human and environmental exposures to HPV chemicals resulting from the manufacturing and use of consumer products, mainly laundry, cleaning, and personal care products. For screening purposes, both environmental and human exposures are typically established using models based on conservative assumptions and readily available information. For environmental screening assessment, conservative assumptions are usually made about characteristics of the chemical, its manufacture and use, and its environmental fate. Similarly, in a screening assessment of consumer exposures via direct use of products, exposure factors such as frequency of use and amount of product use are conservatively estimated. The screening assessment methodologies presented in this document are based on the CA generic exposure framework. Three exposure scenarios are of primary interest as they relate to use of chemicals in consumer products discussed in this book: 1. Human exposures (dermal, oral, and inhalation) to chemicals via use of consumer products 2. Environmental releases of chemicals at a manufacturing facility 3. Environmental releases of chemicals following use and down-the-drain disposal of consumer products For human exposure scenarios involving the direct use of consumer products, the main objective of the risk screening methodology is to identify product categories and associated use scenarios that present the greatest potential for exposure. In the environmental release scenarios (i.e., from manufacturing sites and down-the-drain disposal), potential exposures to both ecological (e.g., fish, wildlife) and human receptors (e.g., drinking water, fish for consumption) are considered. On the basis of this information and appropriate hazard information, uses that warrant detailed evaluation can be identified. This prioritization is done by comparing the estimated human exposure to the appropriate no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for the most sensitive human toxicity endpoint. In this comparison, if a margin of exposure (MOE, the quotient of the NOAEL divided by the estimated human exposure) is adequate, no further evaluation is needed. However, because this initial evaluation process relies on conservative high-end exposure assumptions, if the MOE is not adequate, more refined analyses can be conducted by replacing high-end assumptions with more detailed, scenario-specific exposure information. For the environmental release scenarios, the main objective of the environmental exposure screening methodology is to provide reasonable estimates that are based on predicted environmental concentrations (PECs). PECs are chemical (or chemical category) specific and, by design, are intended to be representative of conditions in a given geographic region. When data are available, refined analyses are conducted by replacing standard, conservative defaults with more chemical-specific and local or regional information. PECs can be used in screening-level risk evaluations by comparing the exposure estimate to a concentration expected to have no effect on organisms in the environment (i.e., the predicted no effect concentration, or PNEC) and determining the margin by which the ratio between the predicted exposure level and the level determined to not cause adverse effects (PEC/PNEC) is less than 1.0. The screening methodology to evaluate human health risks from exposure to chemicals via use of consumer products is presented in Section 2 of this book. The environmental screening methodology addressing environmental release scenarios is described in Section 3. Integrated case studies based on the 5

We hypothesized that improved academic outcomes were likely only when a possible self could plausibly be a self-regulator. Hierarchical regression analyses supported this conclusion, with more support for the influence of self-regulation on change in behavior and academic outcomes than on affect regulation. N ¼ 160 lowincome eighth graders improved grades, spent more time doing homework, participated in class more, and were referred less to summer school (controlling for fall grades and the dependent variable of interest) when academic possible selves were plausibly self-regulatory.

2 D. Oyserman et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 38 (2004) Next year, I expect to be... getting good grades in school (I am staying out of trouble and not talking too much this year), going to high school (I am paying attention in class and doing my work this year). Next year, I want to avoid... Failing 8th grade (I am not skipping class and am doing my work this year), dropping out of high school (I am not being lazy and not getting in trouble this year).

Next year I expect to be... going to high school (I am studying and doing good in the 8th grade), going to King High School (by turning in my high school application and preparing for the test), studying well and passing all my grades (by not getting in trouble and being serious about my studies). Next year I want to avoid... Being a class clown (by listening to the teacher and being quiet in class), not having good grades (by studying and doing my work), and going the wrong direction in life (by being serious about school). (Possible selves of an inner city eighth grader, fall of eighth grade, with strategies noted in parentheses.) These are written responses of eighth graders to questions about what they expect to be like next year, what they want to avoid being like next year, and, in parentheses, their responses to the follow-up question for each possible self, Is there anything you are doing now to get to be this way (or to avoid becoming this way)? While all three youths mention being in high school, the question motivating our research was whether these possible selves were equally effective in maintaining positive affect, sustaining goal focused behavior, and fostering successful academic outcomes over the course of the school year. A number of authors have argued that having a self-relevant plan, goal, possible self, or personal striving in a domain should improve self-regulation (for reviews see Markus & Wurf, 1987; Oyserman, 2001). Indeed, having a plan focuses attention; goal-focused individuals are more likely to ignore information irrelevant to their chosen goals, which allows for more focus on the goal (Gollwitzer, 1996). While in laboratory settings, shifts in goals, personal strivings, or self-motivation clearly influence mood, behavior, and outcomes (Coats, Janoff-Bulman, & Alpert, 1996; Rawsthorne & Elliott, 1999), in more naturalistic settings, personal striving, possible selves, goals or resolutions are often vague and not connected with action plans that detail when, where, and how to proceed toward the goal. To regulate behavior, the self-concept must contain not only goals or desired end states, but also strategies about how to behave in order to reach the desired end state (e.g., ÔI can make it to high school by paying attention in classõ (Higgins, 1996)). Perhaps it should come as no surprise, then, that people often fail to attain their goals (Gollwitzer, 1996). Goals, strivings, and possible selves may serve functions other than self-regulation. They can facilitate optimism and belief that change is possible because they provide the sense that the current self is mutable (Markus & Nurius, 1986). Thus goals or possible selves may simply make us feel good about ourselves, particularly if the goal or future self is vague and carries no specified action plan (Gonzales, Burgess, & Mobilio, 2001). Indeed, a dominant self-goal is simply to feel good about the self to self-enhance (Brown, 1998). By allowing one to feel good about the self and providing hope for a better future, personal strivings, possible selves, and other future oriented aspects of self-concept may fulfill self-enhancement goals. For example, a student may say to herself, ÔI may not be doing well in school now but I will
3 132 D. Oyserman et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 38 (2004) succeed next year,õ in this way buffering self-esteem from current bad grades, though not engaging in any behavioral strategies to actually increase the chance of earning better grades in the coming year. Supporting this notion, Gonzales et al. (2001) found that articulating a goal elevated mood, improved well being and created a sense of optimism about the likelihood of attaining the goal for participants, compared with participants who did not articulate a goal. Self-enhancing possible selves promote positive feelings and maintain a sense of optimism and hope for the future without evoking behavioral strategies. Yet there is also evidence that setting goals and raising aspiration can improve performance. Through self-directed goals, we can harness motivation and direct action toward self-improvement (Brickman & Bulman, 1977; Taylor, Neter, & Wayment, 1995). In this sense, possible selves and other self-directed goals can serve to guide and regulate behavior, providing a roadmap connecting the present to the future. The more plans connect self-directed goals to specific strategies; the more likely they are to be carried out (Gollwitzer, 1996). Indeed there is evidence that even relatively straightforward self-regulation strategies like telling oneself Ôpay attentionõ or Ôwork hardõ can influence outcomes in laboratory settings (Gollwitzer, 2002). In the current paper, we focus on youths living in high poverty neighborhoods and attending urban schools with mostly low-income minority peers. We ask if detailed academic possible selves that contain strategies for working on them will succeed in promoting successful academic engagement a sense of connection to school, on-task behavior in class, and better grades, even among youths at high risk of academic failure or whether it is enough to have many academically oriented possible selves. To study the effects of self-regulatory possible selves, we focus on academic possible selves among low-income adolescents for a number of reasons. We focus on academics because school is a central domain of adolescence and success in school provides a basis for a successful transition into adulthood. A number of studies suggest that school, education, and future occupations are among the most common foci of young teensõ possible selves (Knox, Funk, Elliott, & Bush, 2000; Shepard & Marshall, 1999), and that students who see school as central to their future success have higher current well-being (Cameron, 1999). We focus on minority youths because self-regulation of academic behavior may be particularly important for youths facing stereotypes about their academic interest and abilities. Without the ability to self-regulate, these youths may be particularly vulnerable to stereotype threat (Steele, 1997). Moreover, qualitative research suggests variability in focus on school success among minority groups (Kao, 2000). We focus on adolescence because a focus on the future is intrinsic to the social role of adolescence. Adolescent self-concepts are open to social feedback from peers, the media, parents, and other adults. Youths actively seek evidence of who they might become through social interactions, the responses of others to their behavior, as well as from role models and internalized standards (Harter, 1985). Indeed, some possible selves are quite malleable, shifting in response to feedback either about oneõs own likely success in attaining the possible self (Kerpelman &
4 D. Oyserman et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 38 (2004) Pittman, 2001) or similar othersõ successes and failures in attaining the possible self (Kemmelmeier & Oyserman, 2001). These possible selves are unlikely to serve selfregulatory functions. We speculate, however, that when young adolescents feel committed to and invested in working toward attaining possible selves and link current behaviors to attainment of these future goals, then possible selves can serve a selfregulatory role. By both focusing attention on a self-defining goal and linking the goal to current action, these Ôself-regulatingÕ possible selves can preserve positive affect, maintain behavioral focus, and ultimately propel the self toward the goal, in contrast to self-enhancing possible selves that do not. Research to date has not disentangled the self-enhancing and self-regulatory functions of possible selves, focusing instead on describing content of possible selves and correlating content with outcomes more generally, for example assessing the frequency that positive and negative academic possible selves are generated and the correlation between that and academic success or involvement in delinquent activities (cf. Aloise-Young, Hennigan, & Leong, 2001; Oyserman & Markus, 1990). Even when a more complex coding strategy is used such as the work focused on ÔbalanceÕ in possible selves (Oyserman & Markus, 1990), how the regulatory focus of possible selves would be instantiated was given short shrift. Rather than simply focus on whether youths mention success in school as a self-goal, or whether they mention both an expectation of success and a concern about failure, we hypothesized that academic possible selves differ in whether they are Ôself-regulatingÕ or Ôself-enhancingÕ possible selves. We propose that academic possible selves will guide behavior and produce the intended regulatory consequence over time only when they are detailed and contain strategies for carrying out the goal. Thus, we propose that self-regulation is best achieved when possible selves are detailed and contain strategies for both personal goal focused action and for dealing and engaging with the social context in which the goal is to be achieved. For example, the possible selves of the eighth graders quoted above all include being in high school, yet only the latter two youths describe specific strategies for succeeding in school ( paying attention in class and doing my work this year ) and avoiding failure ( I am not being lazy and not getting in trouble this year. ) Conversely, the first youth envisions being in high school but lacks any strategies to insure success or to avoid failure in this domain. Moreover, only the third youth describes self-regulation focused on the social context of school proposing to avoid being the class clown by listening to the teacher and being quiet in class. While all youths have possible selves about being in high school, only one of the youths has a detailed possible self beyond the broad sketched outlines of high school ( going to King High School, studying well and passing all my grades ) noting which high school and what the self would be doing at that high school. In the current study, we examine these differences in the ways that possible selves are instantiated, predicting that only possible selves that are detailed and connected with specific behavioral strategies can sustain self-regulation over time and therefore be guides for self-improvement. We propose that vague, general possible selves lacking behavioral strategies cannot function to guide self-regulation because they neither provide a specific picture of oneõs goals nor a roadmap of how to reduce
5 134 D. Oyserman et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 38 (2004) discrepancies between the present and oneõs future possible selves (Carver, 2001). We are particularly interested in the impact that possible selves have on academic outcomes among otherwise disadvantaged youths minority youths attending inner city public schools and living in low-income neighborhoods. These youths must figure out a plan of action to succeed in school in spite of these risk factors as well as risks from stereotypes about their interest in school, their academic ability, and their likelihood of succeeding in the world of work beyond school. Therefore, for these youths, having detailed academic possible selves that engender self-regulation and articulate strategies that take into account the social context of school may be particularly critical mechanisms of sustaining positive affect about school, positive behavioral engagement with school and school activities, and in the end, more success in school obtaining better grades and reducing risk of school failure Hypothesis Youths whose academic possible selves are self-regulating (provide a better road map for guiding affect and behavior) will be more successful in the domain of school. Specifically, youths with more self-regulatory academic possible selves will: (a) be better able to focus positive affect on school, (b) be more involved in classroom activities, (c) spend more time doing homework, (d) obtain better grades, and (e) be less at risk of referral to remedial summer school, resulting in improvement in these areas compared with their peers who have less self-regulatory academic possible selves. Since our focus is on self-regulatory academic possible selves that is, detailed academic possible selves that contain strategies to promote self-regulation, rather than the simple presence of academic possible selves, we propose that (f) self-regulatory academic possible selves will be a better predictor of school success than a simple count of the number of academic possible selves or an assessment of the extent that academic possible selves are balanced containing both a positive expectation and a fear or concern in the same domain. Finally, while self-regulation can be operationalized simply as a count of academic strategies, we examine the extent that the combination of detailed academic possible selves and strategies adds predictive power. 2. Method 2.1. Sample Students were a randomly selected half of the eighth grade cohort in three inner city middle schools serving low-income families (67.3% of students at the schools received free or reduced-price lunch). Students enrolled in these schools came from 105 mostly ethnic minority and high poverty census tracks. That is, in these census tracks, 34% of households had incomes below the poverty line, 57% of households were headed by African Americans and 23% were headed by Hispanics; 43% of the adults had less than a high school education, and only 43% of adults were employed (US Bureau of the Census, 2000).
6 2.2. Procedure Of the 168 students randomly selected, written parental approval (for the youth to participate in the survey, to allow the school to release grades and to have a core subject teacher rate the youthõs in-class behavior) was obtained for 160 youths, 81 boys and 79 girls. According to student report, students were African American (n ¼ 99), Hispanic (n ¼ 41), and non-hispanic white (n ¼ 20). As part of a larger study, students filled out a questionnaire in the beginning and end of the school year; at the same time, teachers rated student behavior and our research staff obtained school records of grades and, at the end of the school year, information about referral to remedial summer school. To minimize attrition, an intensive tracking protocol was used to follow youth and obtain spring data for students who left or transferred school. Therefore, missing data were minimal and appeared to be randomly distributed across the data matrix (LittleÕs MCAR chi-square statistic v 2 ðdf ¼ 241Þ ¼267:01, p ¼ :12). In order to use all cases in the multivariate analysis, missing values were estimated using expectation maximization (Schafer & Graham, 2002); 12.4% of the values in the data matrix were estimated Measures D. Oyserman et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 38 (2004) Positive affect toward school is an 11-item 5-point Likert scale (1, strongly disagree and 5, strongly agree) (Arroyo & Zigler, 1995; Cernkovich & Giordano, 1992). Sample items are I feel I really belong at school and I wish I could drop out of school (reverse coded) (fall M ¼ 3:94, SD ¼ 0:59, a ¼ 0:75 and spring M ¼ 3:89, SD ¼ 0:63, a ¼ 0:78). Participation in class is a 4-item 5-point (1, never and 5, always) participation scale from the Finn Student Participation Questionnaire (Finn, Pannozzo, & Voelkl, 1995; eighth grade revision J.D. Finn, personal communication, October 14, 1998). Items were This student pays attention in class, This student completes homework and in-class assignments, This student is persistent when confronted with difficult problems, This student seems to think this course is valuable. A core subject teacher rated these items for each student in the study (fall M ¼ 3:28, SD ¼ 0:73, a ¼ 0:65 and spring M ¼ 3:11, SD ¼ 0:75, a ¼ 0:77). Time spent doing homework is a single question, How many hours a week do you spend doing homework? (fall M ¼ 4:37, SD ¼ 4:68 and spring M ¼ 3:56, SD ¼ 3:03). Archival grade point average. Report cards were collected directly from schools. Grade point average, as calculated from letter grades in at least three courses, was calculated following the typical 5-point scale where A ¼ 4, B ¼ 3, C ¼ 2, D ¼ 1, and F ¼ 0 (fall M ¼ 2:13, SD ¼ 0:79 and spring M ¼ 2:07, SD ¼ 1:00). Referral to remedial summer school is a dichotomous variable determined from school lists of students who would be required to attend summer school in order to be passed to the 9th grade. Students could be referred for not passing at least 3 of the 4 Essential Skills Attainment Tests, for failing grades, or for low attendance. Students were coded as 1 if referred (n ¼ 89) and 0 (n ¼ 71) if not.
7 136 D. Oyserman et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 38 (2004) Self-regulation. To obtain fall self-regulation scores, the following protocol was used. First, we asked youth to generate expectations and concerns for the coming year, and to describe any strategies they had for working toward their expected and away from their feared or to-be-avoided next year possible selves (for specific question wording and format, see Appendix A). Second, we categorized expected and feared possible selves and any strategies for attaining them into one of six domains: school achievement, interpersonal relationships, personality traits, physical/ health, material/lifestyle, or negative (for expected selves) or non-normative/delinquent (for feared selves). Third, we coded the extent to which achievement possible selves and the strategies connected to them were plausibly self-regulating on a 6- point scale; with lower scores indicating a combination of few possible selves and strategies, and higher scores indicating a combination of more possible selves and strategies. Higher scores indicate higher likelihood that self-regulation would occur, with the difference between scores of 4 and 5 being that level 4 strategies focused on academic achievement, while at least some of the level-5 strategies focused on the social context of academic achievement (M ¼ 2:21, SD ¼ 1:28, range ¼ 0 5). An example of a 5-level self-regulatory response is Next year I expect to...go to high school (study and do good in the 8th grade), I will go to King High School (by turning in my high school application and preparing for the test), I will study well and pass all my grades (by not getting in trouble and being serious about my studies). Next year I want to avoid...being a class clown (by listening in school and being quiet), not having good grades (by studying and doing my work), and going the wrong direction in life (by being serious about school). Five coders blind to other youth responses each worked on a randomly assigned subset of the possible self-responses, with one third of each coderõs interviews randomly selected to be double coded by another coder; across all double coding, we obtained a 94% agreement rate. A summary of the coding scheme is provided in Table 1 and the full coding manual is available from the first author. As an alternative, simpler procedure for examining self-regulation that does not require detailed content coding, a count of strategies to attain expected and avoid feared achievement possible selves was also obtained, M ¼ 2:43, SD ¼ 1:99. Number of strategies to attain expected and avoid feared achievement-related possible selves is related to the above coding system, but does not take into account the number or detail of possible selves or whether the strategies do or do not contain the social context of achievement. By pitting this more straightforward count against the content-coded score, the possibility that future research can be carried out with a less extensive coding process but still utilize the notion that self-regulation predicts behavior change and maintenance of positive affect over time can be explored. Achievement possible selves. In addition to the analyses of the predictive power of self-regulation, we also pitted self-regulation with possible selves, coded either as a simple count of the number of expected and to-be-avoided academic possible selves,m ¼ 3:23, SD ¼ 1:58 (Coding manual available from the first author), or as balanced achievement possible selves. Total number of balanced achievement possible selves were the number of pairs of expected and to-be-avoided achievement possible selves that contained opposite sides of the same achievement issue, M ¼ 0:42, SD ¼ 0:55. An example is Next year I expect to be in high school; next year I want

9 138 D. Oyserman et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 38 (2004) to avoid still being in the eighth grade. Balance has been argued to increase motivational persistence. To code for balanced academic possible selves, we used the method described by Oyserman and Markus (1990). 3. Results 3.1. Analysis plan To examine the effects of self-regulatory academic possible selves on positive affect in school, participation in class, time spent doing homework, grades, and risk of repeating eighth grade, we utilized a series of hierarchical regression equations, one for each dependent variable. For each dependent variable, we followed the same order of entry for the blocks of independent variables. At block one, we entered dummy variables for sex and race (white and Hispanic, with African American as the omitted category); at block two we entered fall grade point average from school records; at block three we entered the fall measure of each dependent variable being studied. At block four we entered the fall score for self-regulatory academic possible-selves. By including both fall GPA and the fall level of the outcome variable, we focused on the effect of self-regulation on change during the school year, providing a conservative estimate of the effect of self-regulation, net of general academic success or previous attainment in the domain. To test the alternative hypotheses that simple count of academic strategies, academic possible selves or number of ÔbalancedÕ academic possible selves predicts change in academic outcomes, we repeated all of the above analyses three times, once using at the final block the count of the number of academic possible self-strategies, a second time using a count of the number of academic possible selves and a third time using number of ÔbalancedÕ academic possible selves at the final block. These analyses allowed us to compare the predictive power of self-regulation (with two alternative coding strategies) with that of the centrality of academic possible selves on self-concept (coded in ways that do not disentangle self-enhancement from self-regulatory focus). Two final sets of analyses included: (a) both number of academic strategies and, at the final step, academic self-regulation to provide a stringent test of the predictive power of the more inclusive yet more complex coding scheme and (b) both balance in academic possible selves and, at the final step, academic self-regulation, to provide a stringent test of the added predictive power of self-regulation over and above the effects of balanced academic possible selves. In each case we used a one-tailed criterion, following the directional nature of our hypotheses. Because all outcomes focus on school, we examined their correlation (presented in Table 2) for both fall and spring. Although correlated, outcome variables are not redundant, and each focuses on a substantively different self-regulatory function maintaining positive affect, behavioral engagement (in class, spending time at home on schoolwork), attaining the desired outcomes (attaining good grades and avoiding school failure). Moreover, these dependent variables were collected from three different sources: self-report, teacher report, and school records. There-

Correlations above the diagonal are for fall; those below the diagonal are for spring. * p <:05. ** p <:01. *** p <:001. p <:10. fore we report each finding with a separate regression equation. As a check of the robustness of our findings to different methods of analysis, we also conducted a multivariate set correlation (Cohen, 1982), predicting the entire set of outcome variables from the self-regulation plausibility score, after accounting for the effects of sex, race, and fall values on the outcomes grades, homework time, class participation and positive affect toward school. This analysis tests the null hypothesis of no overall relationship between self-regulation plausibility and the set of outcome variables, controlling for the set of control variables. Confirmation of effects with both methods strengthens confidence that results are not due to capitalization on chance Descriptive analyses We first explored the extent to which the academic domain was indeed central to youthsõ possible selves. On average, 82% of expected selves were focused on the achievement domain (2.36 of 2.88), as were 82% of strategies to attain expected selves (1.80 of 2.19). Similarly, 36% of feared or to-be-avoided possible selves focused on the achievement domain (0.87 of 2.39), as were 36% of strategies to avoid becoming like these feared selves (0.63 of 1.76). While the academic domain was a less common focus of feared than of expected possible selves, it was still the most common domain for feared possible selves. Therefore, attention to plausible academic possible selves can be said to focus on a central self-regulatory concern in this age period. Despite the centrality of the academic domain to youthsõ possible selves, academic participation declined significantly over the school year, lending credence to our focus on Ôself-regulatoryÕ as opposed to non-self-regulatory possible selves. Specifically, teacher rated student classroom participation declined significantly (fall M ¼ 3:28, spring M ¼ 3:11, tð159þ ¼ 2:98, p <:001), as did hours spent doing homework each week (youth report) (fall M ¼ 4:37, spring M ¼ 3:56, tð159þ ¼ 2:20, p ¼ :03). Only archival grade point average (fall M ¼ 2:13, spring M ¼ 2:07,
11 140 D. Oyserman et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 38 (2004) tð159þ ¼ 1:18, p ¼ :24) did not decline significantly. As can be seen in Table 4, girls participated more in class than boys. Participation rates did not vary by race, but the other measures of academic outcome did, with African Americans spending more time in homework, obtaining better grades and being at lower risk of referral to remedial summer school Influence of self-regulation on change in affect, behavior, and academic outcomes The full model is provided in Table 3, where we report change in variance explained at each block, statistical tests of the contribution of each block, and the final model. Regression weights for each of the dependent variables in the final model are presented in Table 4. For ease of reading, in the following section, we discuss only the significant increase in variance explained at the final block with the addition of the self-regulation plausibility score. Positive affect toward school. Using our self-regulation scoring system, we did not find the hypothesized effect of self-regulation on maintenance of positive affect for school, controlling for grades, and level of school bonding in the fall, R 2 D ¼ :00, F Dð1; 154Þ ¼0:04, p ¼ :41; B ¼ 0:01, b ¼ 0:01. Participation in class. As hypothesized, controlling for grades and classroom participation in the fall, students with higher academic possible-self-regulation scores in the fall were rated by their teachers in the spring as participating more in classroom activities: R 2 D ¼ :01, F Dð1; 153Þ ¼3:20, p ¼ :04; B ¼ 0:06, b ¼ 0:11. Time spent doing homework. As hypothesized, controlling for grades and time spent on homework in the fall, students with higher academic possible-self-regulation scores in the fall reported spending more time doing homework in the spring, R 2 D ¼ :04, F Dð1; 153Þ ¼8:17, p <:01; B ¼ 0:49, b ¼ 0:20. Archival grade point average. As hypothesized, controlling for fall grades, students with higher academic possible-self-regulation scores in the fall attained higher grade point averages in the final marking period of the school year, R 2 D ¼ :01, F Dð1; 154Þ ¼5:11, p ¼ :01; B ¼ 0:09, b ¼ 0:12. Referral to remedial summer school. As hypothesized, controlling for fall grades, students with higher academic possible-self-regulation scores in the fall were less likely to be referred by their school to attend remedial summer school classes in the spring. Because referral to summer school is a dichotomous variable, this analysis used hierarchical logistic regression following the same order of entry of blocks as previously described. Wald test for possible-self-regulation score ¼ 2.87, v 2 (1, n ¼ 160) for block ¼ 2.93, p ¼ :04; B ¼ 0:26, expðbþ ¼0:77. Multivariate set correlation. Multivariate analysis confirmed that self-regulation accounted for significant variance in the five academic outcomes considered together, after accounting for the effects of the set of five control variables (race, gender, fall GPA, fall participation, and fall homework) multivariate RaoÕs F ð5; 148Þ ¼2:59, p ¼ :028. Self-regulation accounted for 8% of the multivariate variance across the set of five spring academic outcome variables. This significant finding strengthens confidence that the significant findings across the outcome variables are not due to chance.

To test the alternative, simpler operationalization of self-regulation as the number of strategies related to achievement possible selves, we followed the same procedure, substituting number of strategies for the more complex coding of self-regulation. The more complex coding of self-regulation was a somewhat better predictor than the simpler operationalization as number of strategies related to achievement possible selves. Specifically, number of achievement strategies predicted positive affect toward school (R 2 D ¼ :02, F Dð1; 154Þ ¼4:55, p ¼ :01; B ¼ 0:05, b ¼ 0:15), grades (R 2 D ¼ :03,

These findings suggest that the more complex coding that focuses on both detail of academic possible selves and number of strategies to attain them, may be capturing more relevant variance in behavior change. Finally, added variance explained by self-regulation once count of strategies has been taken into account was examined by entering self-regulation as a final block in the regression analyses. Using this more stringent test (since number of strategies is also taken into account in the self-regulation coding), we found that the more complex self-regulation code added significantly to variance explained by simple count of achievement strategies to prediction of time spent doing homework (R 2 D ¼ :03,
14 D. Oyserman et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 38 (2004) F Dð1; 152Þ ¼6:53, p <:01; B ¼ 0:57, b ¼ 0:24), and at trend level, to prediction of participation in class (R 2 D ¼ :01, F Dð1; 152Þ ¼1:65, p ¼ :10; B ¼ 0:06, b ¼ 0:10), but did not add to prediction of grades (R 2 D ¼ :00, F Dð1; 152Þ ¼0:11, p <:37; B ¼ 0:02, b ¼ 0:02), or summer school referral (Wald test for possible-self-regulation score ¼.20, v 2 (1, n ¼ 160) for block ¼ 0.20, p ¼ :32; B ¼ 0:09, expðbþ ¼0:92). Maintaining positive affect toward school (R 2 D ¼ :01, F Dð1; 152Þ ¼1:98, p ¼ :08; B ¼ 0:06, b ¼ 0:12) was related at a trend level, with the direction of effect suggesting a suppression effect of strategies on plausibility Influence of possible selves on change in affect, behavior, and academic outcomes Number of achievement possible selves. Previous research on possible selves has tended to focus on the centrality of a possible self-domain by utilizing a count of the number of possible selves generated in a domain. To compare the explanatory power of self-regulation with that of centrality, we repeated the previously described regression analyses, using the number of academic possible selves rather than plausibility of possible-self-regulation in the final block. While count of achievement focused possible selves was related to teacher report of participation (F Dð1; 153Þ ¼3:73, p ¼ :03; B ¼ 0:07, b ¼ 0:12), and grades (F Dð1; 154Þ ¼5:36, p ¼ :01; B ¼ 0:10, b ¼ 0:12), it did not add significantly to prediction of maintaining positive affect toward school (F Dð1; 154Þ ¼:42, p ¼ :26; B ¼ 0:02, b ¼ 0:05), time spent in homework (F Dð1; 153Þ ¼0:02, p ¼ :90; B ¼ 0:02, b ¼ 0:01), or summer school referral (v 2 D(1, n ¼ 160) ¼ 0.33, p ¼ :57; B ¼ 0:09, expðbþ ¼0:92). As might be expected, once count of achievement possible selves is taken into account, self-regulation added significantly to prediction of time spent in homework (F Dð1; 152Þ ¼ 9:82, p ¼ :001; B ¼ 0:60, b ¼ 0:25) and summer school referral (v 2 Dð1; n ¼ 160Þ ¼2:68, p ¼ :05; B ¼ :28, expðbþ ¼0:76), and at a trend level self-regulation adds to the prediction of later academic outcomes grades (F Dð1; 153Þ ¼1:90, p ¼ :09; B ¼ 0:06, b ¼ 0:08); however once sum of achievement possible selves was taken into account, self-regulation did not add to prediction of classroom participation (F Dð1; 152Þ ¼1:09, p ¼ :15; B ¼ 0:04, b ¼ 0:07), and neither sum of achievement related possible selves nor the more complex coding of self-regulation predicted maintenance of positive affect toward school (F Dð1; 152Þ ¼0:01, p ¼ :47; B ¼ 0:00, b ¼ 0:01). Number of balanced academic possible selves. We repeated the previously described analyses with balance in academic possible selves as the final block. Balance in academic possible selves was a significant predictor of increased homework (F Dð1; 153Þ ¼7:71, p <:01; B ¼ 1:09, b ¼ 0:20), but not of change in positive affect toward school (F Dð1; 154Þ ¼0:74, p ¼ :20; B ¼ 0:07, b ¼ 0:06), teacher reported participation in class (F Dð1; 153Þ ¼ 1:03, p ¼ :16; B ¼ 0:08, b ¼ 0:06), GPA (F Dð1; 154Þ ¼0:20, p ¼ :33; B ¼ 0:04, b ¼ 0:02), or referral to remedial summer school referral (v 2 Dð1; n ¼ 160Þ ¼1:04, p ¼ :16; B ¼ 0:34, expðbþ ¼0:71). As might be expected, once balance in achievement possible selves is taken into account, self-regulation added significantly to prediction of academic outcomes, GPA (F Dð1; 153Þ ¼ 7:79, p <:01; B ¼ 0:13, b ¼ 0:16), time spent in homework

Plausibility did not add significantly to maintaining positive affect, F Dð1; 154Þ ¼0:40, p ¼ :42; B ¼ 0:01 b ¼ 0: Discussion When asked to describe their expectations and concerns about what they will be like next year, even young teens have no trouble describing expected and feared possible selves selves they expect to attain and those they would like to avoid. Asked if there is anything they are doing this year to get to be like their expected selves or avoid becoming like their feared selves, some youths have strategies, at least for some of their possible selves, while others do not. In our sample, the most common expectation is to do well in school and the most common concern is school failure. Yet, school underperformance is not uncommon among youths, particularly in low-income areas from which we sampled, as noted by other researchers (Ogbu, 1990) and as can be seen by the high rate of referral for remedial summer school. We focused on academic possible selves, asking if such possible selves could serve to increase academic success. Indeed, in our sample of primarily minority youths from high poverty schools and neighborhoods, those with plausibly self-regulating academic possible selves did have significantly greater chances of academic success. Plausibility of self-regulation was a significant predictor, even after previous academic attainment (in the form of first quarter GPA) and previous level of the specific dependent variable were controlled. In spite of their overwhelming focus on attaining school success and avoiding school failure in their possible selves, the average youth in the sample experienced declining levels of school participation and involvement in homework over the course of the eighth grade year. In this context, youths whose academic possible selves could more plausibly serve a self-regulatory function were better able to stem this negative shift over time. Moreover, although the youths in this sample almost universally sought to do well in school, school grades did not change significantly over the school year in spite of these good intentions. Significant improvement occurred only for youths with plausibly self-regulatory academic possible selves. This effect is important for two reasons, first, classroom participation, referral to summer school, and spring grade point average each was substantially predicted by fall grades, leaving a relatively small proportion of variability to be affected by other factors, including self-regulation efforts. Second, self-regulatory possible selves involved the kind of simple, concrete strategies that should be amenable to intervention efforts to support youths who have academic possible selves yet are not currently self-regulating. Youths with academic possible selves that could plausibly serve a self-regulatory focus had academic outcomes that differed significantly from their peers, with improved classroom participation and grades and reduced chance of summer school
16 D. Oyserman et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 38 (2004) referral, as well as increased time spent in homework compared to their peers. Our results point to the importance of considering not only the extent to which youths have academic possible selves or whether these possible selves ÔbalanceÕ positive expectations with concerns but also whether these possible selves are likely to promote self-regulation as opposed to self-enhancement goals. Simply having many academic possible selves or balance in academic possible selves did not relate to improved classroom participation or grades or to reduced chances of summer school referral. Our findings suggest that youths can influence even long term and difficult to shift outcomes like time spent in homework, participation in class, grades and ultimately, school success, if they not only wish for success but also articulate how they will get there. In this study we focused explicitly on plausibility of possible selves as self-regulators for the short term next year, rather than more distal possible selves, such as adult or young adulthood. This is not to say that youths do not imagine the adults they would like to become. However, it seems less likely that these more distal possible selves serve self-regulatory functions for most youths. Self-regulation requires having action plans or strategies connected to self-relevant goals, and in our own work developing interventions to promote self-regulation (Oyserman, Terry, & Bybee, 2002), we found that few low-income youths spontaneously make connections between current behaviors and adult visions. Another reason to focus on shorter term possible selves is that youths can obtain clearer feedback about their success in working toward shorter term expected selves (and avoiding shorter term feared selves) than they would be able to obtain about more distal possible selves. This is important because attaining feedback that signals success in moving toward short term plans and away from feared selves or anti-goals is both reinforcing in its own right and also provides youth with feedback about their likely success in working toward longer term goals such as adult possible selves (Carver, 2001). In a study with undergraduates performing physical exertion tasks, Bandura and Cervione (1983) showed that performance improved only among participants who set a goal, felt competent about reaching it, obtained feedback about their current performance, and felt that current performance was disappointing compared to the goal. In this study, feedback was physiological. In our more naturalistic study, it is likely that feedback for classroom participation and grades and for time spent doing homework came from different sources with the former coming from teachers and school and the latter coming from parents and internal standards. Further study is needed to understand potential influence of feedback source on self-regulation. Moreover, it was youths with plausible possible selves those that included self-regulation strategies, who were able to improve performance. Our data suggest that if we wish to improve outcomes for low-income and minority inner city youths, we must help them link wishes, expectations, and concerns for their academic future with concrete strategies to take action. Our study also highlights the social context of school and schooling. Girls participated more in school than boys, and African Americans outperformed non-african Americans, whether Hispanic or White in terms of grades, risk of referral to remedial
17 146 D. Oyserman et al. / Journal of Research in Personality 38 (2004) summer school, and time spent doing homework. While the gender finding is not surprising (Eccles, Barber, Jozefowicz, Malenchuk, & Vida, 1999), the positive finding for African Americans may perhaps surprise readers. However, for Detroit, where African Americans are the dominant group, this does not seem surprising. The finding does highlight the need to study self-regulation in a variety of real-world settings, over real time and with real-world limitations on change and malleability of outcomes. Although results were robust to reporting source, and have the advantage of use of naturalistic context and time lag, the use of a single sample is a limitation, and the current results must be considered preliminary until they can be replicated with other samples and in other settings. Our ongoing program of research aims at understanding the ways that social contexts can elicit or dampen effective self-regulation. Our analyses suggest that having an achievement-related focus in self-concept provides some impetus to behavior and outcome change and that youth who also have a self-regulatory focus are better able to make change. We explored various operationalizations of self-regulation. Even taking a simple count of the number of strategies youths have devised to work toward their achievement-related expected possible selves and to avoid becoming like their feared achievement-related possible selves captures much of the predictive power of self-regulation. Although a variety of coding methods for self-regulation were useful in capturing change in behavior (time spent doing homework) and academic outcomes (GPA and summer school referral), the two methods differed in that only the simple count of strategies predicted positive change in affect toward school, and only the more complex coding of self-regulation predicted positive change in teacher reported behavior (classroom participation). That many findings are replicated across coding schemes suggests the robustness of connection between self-regulation and behavior change, the differences we do find suggest that future research should use methods for assessing self-regulation that fit the outcomes of interest. Appendix A. Next year possible selves Who will you be next year? Each of us has some image or picture of what we will be like and what we want to avoid being like in the future. Think about next year imagine what you will be like, and what you will be doing next year. In the lines below, write what you expect you will be like and what you expect to be doing next year. In the space next to each expected goal, mark No (X) if you are not currently working on that goal or doing something about that expectation and mark Yes (X) if you are currently doing something to get to that expectation or goal. For each expected goal that you marked Yes, use the space to the right to write what you are doing this year to attain that goal.

1 Proposition 98 How Does It Work? Background Proposition 98 changed the California constitution in 1988 and was modified by Proposition 111 in It establishes a minimum annual funding guarantee for kindergarten through community colleges or K-14 education. Over 40% of the State budget is spent on Proposition 98. And, about 75% of total K-14 funding comes from Proposition 98. Federal funds, special funds (such as lottery revenues), fee revenue (such as student enrollment fees), and non-proposition 98 state General Fund dollars (which are largely dedicated to debt service on school facilities and costs for teacher retirement) make up the remainder. As stated above, Proposition 98 funds both K-12 and community colleges. Currently, about 88% of the Proposition 98 pot goes to K-12 with 12% going to the community colleges. The division between K-12 and community colleges is commonly called The Split. It is not addressed in the constitution and, thus, becomes much of the focus of the Proposition 98 budget battle. In normal years, the growth in Proposition 98 provides enough funding to cover the cost of COLA and growth in student attendance or what is called base apportionment. Any reform measures or special program funding comes on top of this base and only occurs in years with a very positive increase in revenues. Because of the size of the Proposition 98 pot the largest in the State budget and because voters consider education important, Proposition 98 always has a special place in budget negotiations. Determining the Funding Level Each year the State calculates the minimum Proposition 98 funding requirement commonly called The Minimum Guarantee. This minimum guarantee is determined by one of three tests. The tests are mathematical formulas and are based on five major factors: (1) General Fund revenues, (2) state population, (3) personal income, (4) local property taxes, and (5) K-12 average daily attendance (ADA). The Proposition 98 tests or formulas require that two conditions are met. The first is that at least 40% of the General Fund revenue is spent on K-14 education. The second condition is that Proposition 98 grows at least as fast as the economy, as measured by increases in per capita income. As stated above, there are three tests which are used to determine the minimum level of Proposition 98 funding: Test 1 Share of General Fund--simply calculates 40% of the general fund revenue and establishes that as the minimum guarantee or the funding floor for Proposition 98. It produces the lowest level of funding and has not been used to determine the level of Proposition 98 funding since
2 Test 2 Growth in Per Capita Personal Income--calculates the growth in K-12 attendance and multiplies it by the change in per capita personal income and uses the result to once again determine the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee. Generally, this test is operative in years with normal to strong General Fund revenue growth. This test has been used the most frequently. So, how does the State determine which level of funding or which test is operative in a given year? The State must pick the higher of the two amounts calculated. However, in 1990 Proposition 111 was passed to provide relief from the requirements of Test 2 when the economy is growing more slowly than growth in personal income and Test 3 was established. Test 3 Growth in General Fund Revenues increases prior-year funding by multiplying changes in K-12 attendance times growth in per capita General Fund revenues. Generally, this test is operative when General Fund revenues fall or grow slowly. Test 3 cannot be used to provide less money than would be provided under Test 1, however, it does provide for a lower funding level than Test 2. The gap between the levels of funding that would have been produced under Test 2 and the funding level established in a Test 3 year is called The Maintenance Factor and is discussed below. Which test is used in a given year is determined by the provisions in the constitution. The Legislature does not get to decide which test is used to determine the minimum guarantee. Usually, the minimum guarantee is based on changes in ADA and per capita personal income (Test 2) or per capita General Fund revenues (Test 3). Notice that changes in community college FTES (Full Time Student Equivalent) do not affect the tests. The Legislature does have the authority to determine the funding level by either spending less than the guarantee--suspension of Proposition 98--or spending more over appropriating Proposition 98. Both options have major considerations. Suspension requires a two-thirds vote and creates a mandate to repay the money that would have been spent if Proposition 98 had not been suspended. Spending above the minimum guarantee in one year creates a higher floor in the next year. Most policymakers do not want to vote to cut education spending; it has only occurred once in In good years, Proposition 98 has received additional funding. State Sources of Revenues ant the Role of Forecasting Although the budget is enacted appropriating specific amounts to K-12 and community colleges, Proposition 98 funding changes throughout the budget year as the underlying factors General Fund revenues, local property taxes, and K-12 attendance continue to change even after the close of the fiscal year. The Legislature passes the budget based on estimates of revenues, property tax, income, K-12 attendance, and 2
3 population. All of these can change over time and can affect which test will be finally used to determine funding. General Fund Revenues General Fund revenues are comprised of personal income tax, sales and use taxes, insurance, bank, and corporate taxes, and other taxes and fees. Because 56% of General Fund revenues come from personal income tax, a very volatile source of fiscal resources partly because slightly more than one-fourth comes from capital gains and stock options which vary tremendously from year to year, California revenues fluctuate widely from year to year. In fact, General Fund revenues almost parallel changes in capital gains and stock options which reflect the performance of the stock market. Property Tax Revenues Another source of revenue, property taxes, are a relatively stable source of revenue, however, lack of a perfect prediction of the amount of revenue they generate leads to problems for the community colleges. This is because final calculations of property tax revenues come late in the fiscal year, usually around the end of Spring semester, after most of the educational program has already been offered and funds spent accordingly. While K-12 receives an automatic backfill of any property tax shortfall, community colleges do not. Although the Legislature frequently backfills this shortfall for community colleges, in very bad economic times such as we are facing now, either no property tax backfill or an incomplete backfill is provided. This means the colleges have to take a late budget reduction either from their reserves or summer school. Community colleges have tried to find legislative solutions to this issue for many years with no success. K-12 Attendance Proposition 98 only takes growth in K-12 students into account; demand for classes at community colleges is not taken into account when determining the minimum level of Proposition 98 funding. Changes in K-12 attendance are usually fairly predictable and are the basis for Tests 2 and 3. However, demand for community college classes and growth in K-12 attendance do not run in tandem. Need for a community college education increases dramatically in hard economic times, just when State revenues decline and there are budget cuts rather than increases to cover the additional classes needed to serve the students. Community colleges have frequently stepped up to the plate and kept the door open to all students despite lack of funding leading to what is called unfunded FTES. What if the Forecasts are Wrong? It is important to note that if forecasts underestimate the minimum guarantee level of Proposition 98 funding, the State must provide additional revenues to K-14 to fund the higher amount. This amount is called settle up funds. This is automatic and does not require the Legislature to take action, i.e. vote on whether to provide these additional dollars or not. 3
4 If, however, the forecasts overestimate the amount of Proposition 98 funding, the Legislature has to take action to lower the Proposition 98 appropriation. When revenues come in significantly lower than projected and the Legislature decides to act, it leads to mid-year cuts. These are especially hard for the educational community to absorb because the educational year has already been planned and students have frequently enrolled for the Spring semester prior to the mid-year cuts which can include student fee increases as a source of revenue for additional dollars to the colleges. What is the Maintenance Factor? The Maintenance Factor The intent of Proposition 98 is to provide the highest minimum guarantee allowed under the three tests discussed above. The goal is to have the budget grow K-14 funding to accommodate more students and increased costs, paralleling increases in revenue. When the State provides less money than would be provided in a Test 2 year, a funding gap is created. This is called The Maintenance Factor, in other words, the State is required to bring Proposition 98 back to the level of funding it would have received under Test 2 in future years. How long it takes to pay back this money depends on the overall health of the economy. The goal is to grow Proposition 98 funding faster than the economy is growing in bad economic times. The impact is to save the State money until the economy is better and K-14 is all paid back. Does the State Restore the Maintenance Factor? The maintenance factor is the long-term target and paid back when the economy is good. When the economy is booming, the state restores the Maintenance Factor by allocating about fifty-five percent of the new General Fund revenues to Proposition 98. For example, in the early nineties, a stalled economy meant that Proposition 98 was funded under Test 3 for many years. By , the maintenance factor was $2.2 billion. By the entire $2.2 billion had been paid back to Proposition 98. However, the economic downturn in this century has been persistent. Proposition 98 has been suspended and funded under Test 3, yet there has not been enough growth in the General Fund revenue to restore Proposition 98 to full funding. The Big Policy Question: Does a Test 1 Year Produce a Maintenance Factor? At the time the budgets was enacted, there was agreement that would not become a Test 1 year. Therefore, the July agreement for the budget currently includes a $1.1 billion maintenance factor repayment with the rest of the maintenance factor to begin to be repaid in However, the Governor s January budget proposal asserts that has become a Test 1 year because of falling revenues due to the decline in property values. While he takes no money out of Proposition 98 for , he retires the $1.3 billion maintenance factor from prior years. Additionally, while he acknowledges an obligation, no maintenance factor payments are made until
5 What Is the Discussion? Because of the poor condition of the budget, many policy analysts thought Proposition 98 might be funded under Test 1. During that discussion, questions arose regarding the payment of lost funds. In other words, if Proposition 98 is funded using Test 1, and the state spends roughly 40 percent of General Fund revenues on K-14 education, is the state required to bring spending back to the amount that would have been mandated to have been spent on K-14 education if Test 2 had been used. Other than the first year under Proposition 98 in , the state has always provided more for K-14 education than Test 1 required and has calculated the minimum guarantee using either the Test 2 or Test 3. If there is a Test 1 year, the debate will heat up over how Test 1 works. According to the Legislative Analyst, the debate tends to hinge on whether the constitutional provisions are read literally (sometimes leading to odd outcomes) or in a way that avoids strange outcomes (but conflicts with the literal language). There was an attempt to resolve the issue in Proposition 1B in the May 2009 election, but it failed. What Are the Exact Concerns About a Test 1 Year? The concern is how maintenance factor is treated under Test 1. There are two questions: 1) Does the state need to establish a maintenance factor? 2) Is the maintenance factor on top of the Test 2 level? Issue number one questions whether the gap between what would have been allocated to Proposition 98 under Test 2 versus Test 1 becomes a maintenance factor that needs to be paid back in out years. Historically, Test 3 years have produced a maintenance factor to establish the amount of money schools are due which is the difference between the higher Test 2 level which is owed and the lower Test 3 level which was paid. There is a difference of opinion on whether the same would happen in a Test 1 year. The second issue questions whether maintenance factor payments will be made on top of the Test 2 or Test 1 levels. California Federation of Teachers has filed a lawsuit to determine what the law is for a Test 1 year regarding the treatment of the maintenance factor. How the Maintenance Factor Dollars Are Currently Allocated The maintenance factor created in gives only 8% to the community colleges. The historical share of Proposition 98 has usually ranged from 10 to 11%. This share is based on the amount of workload, full-time equivalent students, generated by K-12 versus community colleges as measured at the time of implementation of Proposition 98. The community colleges share of the workload has grown over time to the current level of roughly 17% or 18%. The community colleges have spent a lot of their advocacy on finding a permanent solution to this annual issue. The most recent effort was Proposition 92 which would have separated the community college portion of Proposition 98 from the K-12 portion. However, that effort failed and thus the battle over the Proposition 98 split continues. Needless to say, the community colleges will be focused on getting the 5
6 colleges and their students a fair share of the Proposition 98 and any associated maintenance factor dollars. Additionally, the budget gave half of the maintenance factor dollars allocated to the community colleges to backfill cuts to base apportionment and half would go to expand the Career Technical Education as defined under SB 70. The community colleges go through a lengthy consultation process on developing budget priorities. Budget priorities always focus on backfilling any holes in the base. Additionally, there has been a substantial loss in buying power of a community college dollar because there has been no money to fund COLAs. When per student funding is lowered, there is no question it negatively impacts the quality of a community college educational experience as seen in longer lines, larger class sizes, fewer course offerings, and less services provided, for example. Additionally, employees have taken substantial hits to their paychecks, been furloughed, and jobs have been lost. In other words, there is a very large pent up demand to get back the lost COLAs and restore purchasing power to the community college dollar. Finally, the cuts to categorical programs have been devastating as have fee increases. There is concern among the community college community regarding both the Split and where the money is targeted to be allocated. The community colleges will have to develop and implement an effective advocacy campaign in order to achieve an appropriate level of resources. Conclusion Other Budget Priorities Finally, all discussions regarding Proposition 98 do not occur in a vacuum rather how the budget affects all other areas of State government are considered during deliberations. For example, the State should have spent an addition $3.1 billion on Proposition 98. However, this would have cut other non-98 programs even further. Thus, the State chose to suspend Proposition 98 creating a maintenance factor, but preserving other services including other institutions of public higher education, i.e. UC and CSU. Additionally, in the increased tax revenues passed in February 2009 sunset taking $10.9 billion in resources out of the General Fund, creating another hole in the California budget that needs to be filled either by increased revenues or further cuts to programs. As stated above, paying back the maintenance factor is slated to begin in Additionally, Proposition 98 will be increasing faster than growth and COLA. However, the structural problems in the overall budget will continue to persist unless new sources of revenue are found. There will be pressure to increase student fees. Californians are very supportive of California community colleges. Community colleges will continue to need their support to bring the needed revenue to fund our high quality programs. And, Californians need community colleges more each day whether it is to prepare for transfer to a 4-year university, earn a career technical certificate to enter the job market, retrain to change jobs, build basic skills, or any of a multitude of goals that 6
7 make the people of California better prepared for this millennium and California s economy strong, vital, and growing. 7

70 HOOFDSTUK V SUMMARY The development of the rhombic list of the rhombencephalon of the white rat was studied in 67 specimens. A tabu lar survey of the specimens investigated of the various stadia of prenatal and postnatal development, of the methods of fixation, dissection and staining will be found on page For the section of the prenatal series see fig. 7. The prenatal development (21 days) is described for the 12th, 14th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20thand 21st day. The postnatal development is described only for the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 20th and 40th day. From a survey of the literature it was found that in 1890 HIS described what hecalleda "Rautenlippe" in the human embryo, in English literature indicated as "rhombic lip", along the dorsal border of the alar plate from the 4th ventricle. His described the development of the cerebellum and the inferior oliva from this lip. In 1907 & 1912 ESSICK added to these formations those of the pons and the arcuate nuclei, which, according to him, would develop likewise, together with the inferior oliva, through a single migration, the oliva-arcuate migration, from the rhombic lip. Other authors. SCHAPER 1894, HAYASHI1924, JAKOB 1928,TELLO 1938, BON- NEVIE & BRODAL1946, LARSELL1952, KAUFMANN 1959, describe either the histogenetic development of the cerebellum or the phylogenetic and ontogenetic development of lobi and fissures in the cerebellar cortex. Only HARKMARK 1954, has studied the development of the pons by experimental research on the migration of the pons by chick-embryos. None of these authors has checked HlS's description of the rhombic lip, although our investigations concerning the development of the dorsal border of the rhombencephalon in the white rat, showed us the remarkable fact that such a rhombic lip structure develops only over a very much limited area, whereas the rest maintains a structure which we will designate as a list. We concluded that the lipstructure of this list must result from very complex mechanical factors: flection of the neural tube in the cephalic-, pontic-, and neckbends as well as a strong backward pressure of the mesencephalic and telencephalic hemisferes on the metencephalon, indirectly resulting in changes of the bulbar part of the rhombencephalon. The processes of these developments of the rhombencephalon and their influences on the rhombic list could be demonstrated convincingly from the deformations induced in a plastic tube. For a comparison of these deformations with the observed deformations of the rhombencephalon we refer to fig. 1, where the tela chorioidea is reproduced by a longgitudinal cut in the tube. On the left isa sketch of the plastic tube model, on the right the rhombencephalon indifferent stadia of flection. The similarity is so striking that the conclusion would seem to be justified that a primary straight rhombic list along the 65
71 attachment of the tela chorioidea will cause a lipstructure to emerge by flection and torsion of the wall in a particular area. The emergence of an overall lip-structure in the human embryo might be explained by a more intense effect of these factors on the human rhombencephalon. But here, too, a list-structure must precede the lip-structure. As an argument forthiswe may point to the illustration provided by His himself (1894, fig. 26) of a humanembryo, 3 weeks old, in which the structure of the rhombencephalon and also the dorsal border of the alar plate, is identical with that of a 12-day albinorat embryo. As for the attachment of the tela chorioidea to the rhombic lip, HIS assumes that the tela chorioidea merges with the lip. This would result in a new medial attachment, and a large area of the rhombic lip - the cerebellar part - would thus become extra-ventricular and would show further extra-ventricular development. However, we could not find any indications of such a déplacement of the taenia chorioidea in the white rat. The taenia follows the torsion of the rostral list. The extra-ventricular outgrowth of the cerebellum is caused on the side by a great increase of cells of the cerebellar list out of the primary matrix, on the other side by the development of a secondary or superficial matrix out of the primary matrix at the taenia chorioidea on the surface of the cerebellar list. Out of the ce 11-proliferation of the ventricular matrix originate both the central nuclear mass of the cerebellum and the Purkinje-cells found in the cortic al layer. The rhombic list is characterised from the beginning by the absence of a marginal zone: a remarkable fact, not stressed in the literature. This fact enabled us at every moment to recognize very distinctly on the one hand the rhombic list and its dérivâtes, on the other hand the dérivâtes of the alar and basal plates of the rhombencephalon. With this fact in mind we concluded that dérivâtes of the rhombic list develop outside this marginal zone only, whereas dérivâtes of the alar plates migrate within the marginal zone. In the caudal list we also observed the presence of a primary matrix which on the 16th day gives rise to the secondary matrix. The migration of this secondary matrix develops outside the marginal zone, hence we inferred that the caudal list gives rise to no other migration than the pontine one. For the white rat we cannot accept HlSíconception that the oliva nuclei derive from the rhombic lip, nor ESSICK's either, who assumes that both the inferior oliva and the arcuate nuclei do so. Further investigation of the human embryo with this new fact in mind, viz. the absence of the marginal zone, might show whether our conclusions hold for the development of other animal species and man as well. A chronological survey of the development of the different dérivâtes from the rostral and caudal list follows here. 66

74 The main results of our investigations concerning the rhombic list may be stated as follows: 1. The rhombic list is a proliferation of the alar plate at the taenia chorioidea, characterised by the absence of the marginal zone. 2. All dérivâtes of the rhombic listare characterised by their position outside the marginal zone; consequently the olivo-arcuate Migration has its origin not in the rhombic list but in the alar plate itself. 3. Owing to mechanical and spatial factors, connected with the curvature of the rhombencephalon and the retroverted development of the mesencephal and telencephal hemispheres, the list-structure is not only subdivided into a rostral and caudal part but can also recurve more or less into a lip-structure. 4. In the white rat this lip-formation only develops in the caudal part of the list, immediately behind the "Rautenbreite". 5. The histogenesis of the rhombic list is characterised by the formation of two matrices, a primary or ventricular matrix and a secondary, extra-ventricular or superficial one. 6. From the primary matrix of the rostral develop, well-distinguished from each other, on the one hand the central nuclear mass and on the other the Purkinie-cells of the cerebellum. From the primary matrix of the caudal list develops only the nucleus parabulbaris. 7. From the secondary matrix of the rostral list develops the granular cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. From the secondary matrix of the caudal list originates the pontine nuclear mass. 8. The central nuclear mass of the cerebellum continues to be one coherent whole with "nuclear-like" medial, intermediate, and rostro-lateral excrescences, originated under the influence of the cerebellar surface development. 9. Before birth, on 21th day, the cerebellar surface shows only one fissura, the fissura postero-lateral is. On the 6th postnatal day all the fissurae have been formed. 10. The fiber pattern development is such as to form first the afferent cerebellar fibers (16th prenatal day), next the intrinsic fibers (18th day) and not until the efferent fibers (20th day). Last of all develop the ponto-cerebellar fibers (4th postnatal day). 11. Myelinisation of these fiber systems begins on the 10th postnatal day. 12. The development of the pons and of the nucleus parabulbaris is completed on the 10th postnatal day; that of the cerebellum on the 40st day. We have tried to determine as exactly as possible by means of observations the development of the rhombic list and its dérivâtes in order to have a basis for subsequent observations and for an experimental research, which is already being carried out, but the results of which are still touncertain to justify communication at this stage. 69

I love monsters. All too much of my childhood was spent digging through dusty copies of Dragon at the local library in search of new beasties, and I still can't resist a good (or, for that matter, bad) monster movie. I'm also growing to love Privateer Press and their high-fantasy/steampunk Iron Kingdoms setting, as evidenced by my recent review of the wonderful adventure module, The Longest Night. For both of these reasons, I was overjoyed to have an opportunity to review the Monsternomicon, a hard-bound volume devoted to the creatures of the Iron Kingdoms.
As with many hardback D20 releases, the book is designed to look somewhat like an ancient tome, albeit an ancient tome with a big scary zombie bursting from its cover. This cover features lots of bolts and hinges beneath its text and logos, and on the inside, a light background of stains and tatters is printed behind everything. The book doesn't follow exactly the same format as Wizards of the Coast's Core Rulebooks, but it's close enough to look nice alongside them on your gaming table, and unlike some competing products, the book manages not to render its text unreadable with its decorations. The layout is accompanied by lots of gritty illustrations by Brian Snoddy and Matt Wilson, and while few of the monsters portrayed are especially stunning or innovative in design, they're all skillfully drawn and dynamically posed.
As expected, the majority of the book is devoted to monsters, and close to a hundred beasts are detailed. Each monster gets at least a two-page spread, with more space devoted to some. The entries follow the same basic format as the Monster Manual with several notable enhancements. At the top of each entry, a silhoutte drawing shows a size comparison between the beast in question and an average human. In place of dry descriptions, each entry is introduced with an anecdote by Professor Viktor Pendrake, Adventuring Scholar. After the combat tactics, most entries also feature a "Legends & Lore" section offering tidbits of knowledge categorized as Common, Uncommon, Rare and Obscure and either one or two adventure hooks designed to introduce player characters to the monster.
I really like this layout, but I think Privateer Press made a mistake by failing to include an introduction explaining it. The book goes straight from the table of contents into the first entry, and it leaves the reader a little uncertain of how to deal with some of the information. I didn't notice the size-comparison silhouettes until I was almost a third of the way through the book, and the rules and background explaining the "Legends & Lore" system and the history of Viktor Pendrake would have served the reader better as prefaces than as appendices. All but the most unobservant readers will eventually figure out how everything fits together, but some guideposts would have been nice from the start.
The content of the book is of almost uniformly high quality, though I confess that I was a little disappointed nonetheless. The Longest Night was such a tremendous success that I had extraordinarily high expectations of this product, and while it is strong, it doesn't stand out as much as it might have. The monsters are interesting and well-thought-out, sometimes also effectively comical or mildly disturbing, but none of them stray far from previously established formulas. The Pendrake anecdotes and adventure hooks are nice touches, but only a few of them struck me as being truly inspired. Although I was occasionally engaged or amused by these features, I found myself getting tired of hearing about exactly how Pendrake's latest scholarly assistant was slaughtered or finding hooks that basically amounted to "the monster has something valuable/is killing people, so you must find and defeat it." Don't get me wrong; it's almost all good stuff. I just had hoped to be stunned by some of its originality, and that never happened.
Despite the fact that it didn't utterly astound me, the Monsternomicon is good at what it does. Its pages consist of a good mix of undead abominations, technological constructs only found in the Iron Kingdoms setting, playable races, dangerous animals, unique figures of legend, and reinventions of familiar beasts like trolls and dragons. All challenge levels are covered, from the fragile and unwittingly dangerous Moonwing moths all the way up to some nearly godlike dragons with Challenge Ratings in excess of 50. There's a fairly decent amount of material that is of general use to almost any DM, though large chunks of the book, notably the mechanical creatures and new races, are best ignored by a DM running a campaign outside of the Iron Kingdoms.
The book's Iron Kingdoms emphasis is further established by frequent references to specific bits of geography (making me wish that the setting's worldbook would come out soon!), and it even features some appearances by familiar characters and creatures (and, I should warn, spoilers) from The Longest Night and the rest of the Witchfire Trilogy. Speaking of the trilogy, I was rather surprised that only a handful of the new monsters introduced in those adventures are reproduced here. It's nice that Privateer Press concentrated on filling this volume almost exclusively with new material, but this means you won't be able to put the adventures away after you're done running them since you'll still probably want to look up Swamp Shamblers and the like from time to time. I suppose this should come as no surprise -- one shouldn't expect absolute comprehensiveness from a book clearly marked "volume one."
Though most of the book seems error-free, there are a couple of serious problems. The worst flaws are, for some reason, found in the section on dragons. There are some places where it looks like somebody forgot to fill in statistics (a table on page 53, for example, contains some underscores where numbers should be), and some of the descriptions seem to have gotten jumbled together - a description of a fire-breathing dragon mentions that the beast is sometimes known as the Frost Mother, which simply makes no sense. Of course, your players might be grateful that some of the dragon material is currently unusable - these beasts are so powerful that it's probably safest to keep them the stuff of rumors and legends until your campaign reaches a very high level indeed. Hopefully by that time, some errata will have been released.
As I previously mentioned, the book's monsters are supplemented by material contained in several appendices. Some of this material should probably have been front matter, but most is located in the appropriate place. There are some nice rules and items designed to make library research almost as valuable to the Iron Kingdoms hero as it is to the Call of Cthulhu investigator. There's a useful assortment of "Quickplates," monster templates like "Alpha Hunter" and "Deep Dweller" that can be applied quickly and easily to bump Challenge Ratings up a notch or two. These are followed by some well-designed new Prestige Classes: the Adventuring Scholar, the Bone Grinder and the Monster Hunter. These were actually among the highlights of the book for me, and I've already started playing with an Adventuring Scholar character -- great fun! The last few pages of the book contain a discussion of the cosmology of the Iron Kingdoms and a list of playable races. While these materials are somewhat appropriate to this volume, they seem like they might have fit better into the still-unreleased worldbook, and I would happily have sacrificed them in order to get the one thing this book seriously lacks: a set of encounter tables showing where these new monsters can be found and possibly giving some hints as to which traditional Monster Manual monsters are appropriate for use in the Iron Kingdoms.
Ultimately, the value of this book depends on what you plan to use it for. If you're running a general fantasy campaign, it may be of some interest to you, especially if you're after the rules and classes in its appendices; however, its usefulness will be limited by the fact that many of its monsters aren't as interesting in isolation, and by the large quantities of Iron Kingdoms-specific material. If, on the other hand, you're running (or thinking of running) an Iron Kingdoms campaign, it's almost essential reading. While many of its creatures aren't too original, they are all, as I've said, solidly designed, and they'll serve as a good basic assortment of beasts to give the Iron Kingdoms a unique flavor and to provide some surprises for players who have memorized the standard Monster Manual. Reading this book is also a valuable experience for an Iron Kingdoms DM, since Pendrake's stories, despite sometimes being repetitive, help give a sense of the world and its inhabitants. Pendrake himself may also make a useful NPC from time to time, and his complete statistics are provided for this purpose.
I can't help feeling that in some departments, the editors and publishers could have done a better job here. Still, though it may not be as perfect as I had hoped, it's a solid contribution to the line of D20 monster books currently on the market and an important part of one of the most promising new campaign settings around. This isn't for everyone, but those who need it will value it highly.

When Boxers Take to the Soccer Field: How Populism is Confounding the Game of EU Integration ~ European Union Center at the University of Illinois
On November 16, the European Union Center (EUC) of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign co-sponsored a lecture by Emilia Zankina, Associate Professor in Political Science and Provost of the American University in Bulgaria. Dr. Zankina’s talk, Theorizing Populism East and West, was part of the Russian, East European, and Eurasian Center’s (REEEC) New Directions lecture series and addressed the nature of populism in today’s Europe.
The focus of Dr. Zankina’s talk was on the problem of defining and theorizing populism and on discussing her new theoretical approach to the subject. According to Zankina, populism has found renewed interest among scholars due to its success in Europe and around the world. Yet, populism defies easy articulation, because it exhibits chameleon-like traits, making it visible across the political spectrum, in rightwing, centrist, and leftwing forms. Despite this resisting of easy definition, Zankina argued that populism does exhibit some important commonalities that make it a meaningful term for analysis. These include, for instance, reliance on charismatic leaders for political direction, avoidance of specific plans for executing policy, and aggressive assault on the political rules of the game that populist parties see as inhibiting easy resolution of major social crises, such as immigration or economic decline. In other words, no matter the political message of a particular populist party, be it left, right, or centrist, the party sells itself as the savior of society, because it can bypass the political status quo to rescue the country from ruin and peril.
Here, Zankina forwarded her new theoretical approach for studying populism. Since all political parties sell themselves as able and ready to solve pressing social problems, Zankina distinguishes populism as a political strategy that relies on informal institutions and informal means to do so. Hence, populism promises to reduce political transaction costs by sidestepping formal political processes, such as use of vetoes and checks and balances, to expedite the saving of the nation. By informal, top-down means, Zankina noted, one of Bulgaria’s populist parties promised national salvation within 800 days.
So, what happens, as several audience members inquired, when populist parties win and win within the context of the European Union (EU)? Zankina responded that populist parties adapt to the formal political processes already in place, or they fail to survive. This is because the platforms of the parties are often highly emotional, lacking substantive policy foundations. Only when such parties form coalitions with traditional political parties are they able to carry out sustained policy changes. However, as Zankina further noted, because populist parties succeed through their rejection of formal political rules of the game, they pose challenges for the EU, even when they do not win elections. This is because the EU has no effective means for stopping these parties. As Zankina concluded, harsh reports and sanctions do not work against these parties, causing them to “freeze” the process of EU integration. Subsequently, then, these parties appear to be like boxers taking to the soccer field. They are successful at what they do by not complying with the rules of the game.

Anciently, a chrisom was the face-cloth, or piece of linen laid over a child's head when he was baptized or christened. This article incorporates content from the 1728 Cyclopaedia, a publication in the public domain. — “Chrisom - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia”, en.wikipedia.org

He also rides a motorcycle. — “Moonlight Mask - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia”, en.wikipedia.org

As the world of finance has been, for a long time, seen as an ‘all boys club’, women have been marginalised in traditional forms of finance, venture capital and business angel investing. On average, women-owned firms start and grow their businesses with considerably less external financing compared to men (Department of Commerce US). In Australia, female entrepreneurs have experienced undercapitalisation as a core issue that undermining the success of growing their business. A 2013 study conducted by the (Australian Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry (AWCCI) of 3000 women entrepreneurs found that half of those surveyed required more funding to facilitate the growth of their business. The majority of those women have started their venture with less than $5000 worth of capital.
Crowdfunding platforms, however, now offer female entrepreneurs the chance to promote and grow their business by providing access to capital. By providing such opportunity, crowdfunding democratises finance by placing women on a level playing field with men. Moreover, with a growth in female entrepreneurship in Australia and the amount of women starting businesses increasing by 8.9% in 2013 (AWCCI), access to crowdfunding platforms in Australia will play a key role in providing capital to women. Women are almost 4 times more successful when crowdfunding than raising capital through traditional means. The number of female-owned businesses that receive venture funding in US is only 13%, however the number of crowdfunding campaigns run by women that meet their funding target is around 47% (Forbes).
A little more than a year ago, President Obama signed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act into law. The JOBS Act was intended to increase access to capital for the innovative companies that produce the majority of employment growth and are otherwise starved for investment capital. These early-stage startups do not have access to traditional bank loans, and venture capitalists disproportionally fund growth-stage, high-tech ventures, leaving otherwise potentially lucrative and promising ideas out in the cold.
New data published by the crowdfunding platform I founded, EquityNet, shows that equity crowdfunding is already aiding the vast business community that was previously underserved by the traditional private equity community (VC firms and Angel investors). Based on an analysis of more than 1,000 companies that have used the EquityNet platform, some very interesting findings include: …
Nikola Tesla wrote once, “The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine.” I can see this being quoted by any supporter of equity based crowdfunding (or crowdinvesting) — an innovative online tool that would give you a legitimate right to own a stake in a company you choose to invest in. Just like angels investors do.
There are several equity-based crowdfunding portals here in the U.S. that are already operational such as AngelList, The FundersClub, EarlyShares or RealtyMogul. But since the private investors in the U.S. must fit an accredited investor profile (Rules 501, 505 and 506 of Regulation D) – there is only 1 percent of the population that is allowed to utilize such an option. …

Feeling eager, the designer rushes off. He begins interviewing users. She does a competitive analysis and digs up loads of useful design patterns and informative data. Wireframes begin to form. Big questions are asked. Then even BIGGER questions. Soon the designer(s) on the team are questioning the fundamental nature of the internet.
A deadline looms. The wireframes lurch forward, beautiful but awkward like all new life. The designers love them like flat, digital children. They iterate a few times internally, then share their brilliant direction with the team.
And everyone else is confused, then irritated. They might be beautiful children, but they have nothing to do with what the team has set out to do or the problem it’s set out to solve. Back to the drawing board.
I’ve seen this happen so many times it makes my eyes bleed. There’s lots of problems here, some of which are sort of not the designers fault. But a lot of them are.
Please. Please. PLEASE! Pay attention to the scope of the project you’re working on, damn it. You are part of a team, to achieve a goal, to solve a specific problem. If you don’t do that, you’ve wasted everyone’s time. More importantly, you’ve wasted YOUR time. You could have been making something horrible easier to use for someone, but instead you have a drawing and not much else to show for it. I know, it sucks. No matter how great the design thinking that went into it, IT SUCKS. That’s what makes me so angry about it.
If consultants make this mistake, it’s a disaster. It’s late nights with no pay, or losing a client. Working in-house, it’s easier (although not always). Okay, we learned a lot! Let’s iterate!
My point is more about self-awareness. Before we rush off into happy pixel funtime or design wireframe happy land, we have to take a breath and make sure we understand what we’ve been asked to do. We must make sure we understand the needs of those around us. We say we are experts on understanding people and their needs. When we turn around and don’t understand the person we spend most of the week with? It discredits us in their eyes. “How well can they understand our users if they don’t even understand me? And I’m right here!” This is more often a subtle, subconscious loss of trust over time more than someone overtly thinking this.
We may need to be assertive and do things that supposedly aren’t “design activities” to make sure we understand what we’re getting ourselves into, such as writing up assumptions or requirements. If you’re on a project with ambiguous direction or unclear requirements, don’t let it slide. Don’t assume someone else will figure it out. Ask for clarity. Writing up your understanding in the form of user scenarios or short one paragraph narratives is a great way to get people thinking concretely about what the heck they are doing. It’s also a completely normal design activity that most of the time shouldn’t step on anyone’s toes.
When in doubt, ask why. I’ve heard it said countless times. The best designers ask why. Why are we doing this? Why are we here? Why does it need to be that way? Why am I drawing this screen exactly?
Take a step back and ask yourself. What is the most important thing you can achieve here? What’s the most important thing everyone could miss?
Kids make drawings. Designers motivate colleagues to build better things, for the benefit of everyone.

My name is Mike Chen, a program manager working on the Windows Server Essentials Deployment team. I’m honored today to introduce the new deployment story for Windows Server Essentials.
Previously, we heard a lot of feedback that users want rich features in Windows Server Essentials to be available more broadly beyond the Windows Server Essentials edition. In the Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials release, we’ve made major investments into making our deployment available as a server role. Therefore, as Jason mentioned in an earlier blog, the features in Windows Server Essentials are being released in both Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials and as the Windows Server Essentials Experience server role in Windows Server 2012 R2.
We use a consistent architecture across the following editions: Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, and Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard and Datacenter. From a technical perspective, features are packaged into the Windows Server Essentials Experience role in exactly the same way. The key difference regarding the deployment is that in Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, the role is pre-enabled and the configuration wizard is configured to pop up automatically when a user logs on to the computer. (There are also differences around locks and limits that are not in the scope of this blog.)
As a server role, Windows Server Essentials Experience can be deployed on a workgroup box, a domain controller, or a member server in the domain. The limitations here are that Windows Server Essentials Experience can only be deployed to a single domain environment and you can’t have a read-only domain controller (RODC) in your environment.
When deployed on a workgroup box, the configuration wizard will ask you for information to bring up a new Active Directory domain environment and configure other roles and features that the role depends on.
When deployed on a member server in the domain or on an existing domain controller (you need to join your existing domain by using native tools), the configuration wizard simply configures other roles and features without changing your domain environment. Therefore, for users who want to try out the experience, the best way is to deploy Windows Server Essentials on a member server in your existing IT environment, which is much less intrusive. The steps are:
You may have already noticed that previous migration paths in the configuration wizard are not needed, because Windows Server Essentials can be deployed on an existing domain controller. If you want to migrate to the latest platform, just do an Active Directory replication and then configure Windows Server Essentials. For more information about migration, see Migrate from Previous Versions to Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials.
Run the following command to start the configuration to set up Windows Server Essentials as an existing domain member. You must be a member of the Enterprise Admin group and Domain Admin group in Active Directory to perform this task:
With the wide adoption of virtualization, we’ve heard more and more feedback that customers want to deploy their servers as virtual machines (VMs). Windows Server Essentials Experience provides a great tool that allows an end user to seamlessly set up their physical server as a VM host and bring up virtualized Windows Server Essentials as a VM guest. This tools requires that OEM and system builders do some pre-configuration on the image. The tool works for Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials and Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard. In a future blog post, we will share more detailed steps about how to configure this.
As a system provider, you have the option to let your customer choose between a virtual deployment or a physical deployment.
If an end user chooses a virtual deployment, Windows Server Essentials will have the Hyper-V role installed and will be able to run VMs, and the wizard will create a customized Windows Server Essentials VM based on the end user’s settings. In addition, any Windows Server roles that aren’t necessary for hosting VMs will be removed from the host to reduce the footprint on the host.

Jody filled Tressa's and my tummies with some terrific Japanese fare: miso soup with daikon, arrow(???) root, potatoes, onions and carrots; japanese rice topped with seasoned grilled chicken; cucumber & cherry tomato salad tossed in the best only-in-Japan seasame dressing; and, raw tofu slabs topped with fresh green onion and sukoshi (just a little) soya sauce. Mmmmmm...
My first experience with raw tofu: yummy! Taste is authentically Japanese; texture is like cheesecake - and who can beat that?! I definitely recommend it!! I'm turning into a tofu-and-soy-bean-aholic! Ahhhhhh! ;)

Do you want to improve your life but don’t know where to start. Some of the simplest things can have the greatest effect. We will look at some great habits that are fairly easy to develop and can overhaul how you see your life.
You may have already heard a lot about successful peoples’ morning routines. While you don’t need to follow one exactly, you should understand that the early hours are when many people are most productive. Even if you’re not a morning person, you may still find it easy to accomplish hard work shortly after rising.
Some people simply waste away the morning checking emails and Facebook, while sipping coffee. Keep in mind that you could be accomplishing more.
Education is a lifelong process, so you want to schedule some time each day or week to improve your knowledge. It’s made easy as you have the internet at your fingertips. Whether you want to learn how to build a website or need a derivative chart, you can easily grab your PC or smartphone and get to work.
Let’s face it, the modern world is stressful. Even after a day’s work is finished, you may still be subjected to a barrage of emails, messages, and other notifications. The ability to switch off is crucial to handle stress. If you have never tried meditation and prayer then you may want to give it a go to see if it can be of benefit.
Of course, meditation of prayer done once in a blue moon won’t have the same effect as regular sessions. Aim to turn it into a regular habit.
Many people think reading is boring, but that’s only because they haven’t found a good book. The right text can engage your mind and help you de-stress. Reading has also been shown to help you fall asleep easier. If you aren’t a regular reader, then you may want to increase the time spent with a book.
The brother of reading is writing. Putting your thoughts down on paper is actually a great way to help organize your mind among other benefits. The tricky part is making it a habit as it does require more effort than reading. Consider starting a journal and jotting down a few lines each night. Over time, this may develop into an enjoyable habit.
The ability to cook a good meal basically makes you an adult who can take care of themselves properly. The problem is that many fully-grown people simply struggle in the kitchen. If you want to improve your health and your enjoyment of life, then it’s time to master some nutritious and tasty recipes. You will also save a ton on eating out.
These habits will take some effort to develop, but the rewards will be worth it. If you really want to enhance your life, then it’s these simple things that may have the greatest impact. Consider starting on one of them today.

Dear friends, today I had a wonderful feeling! I went to greet the boys of Bardiani. I call them kids, but they could be my children.

SIBC is a public service broadcaster which facilitates educational programs, recording and promotion of local music and the unity of diverse cultures in a scattered island nation.
The Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation was established by an Act of Parliament - The Broadcasting Ordinance 1976. It was established to provide a high quality broadcasting service, by radio, of a wide range of programs for the information, education and entertainment of all people living in the sovereign borders of the Independent State of Solomon Islands.
Radio broadcasting was established by US military forces in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate (BSIP) during World War Two. In 1944, the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) developed small, mediumwave stations at Lunga on Guadalcanal and Munda, New Georgia. These were designed to provide information and entertainment to the hundreds of thousands of US service personnel then based in the BSIP. The stations were part of the Mosquito Network, a loose network of similar AFRS stations stretching through the South-West Pacific, from Bougainville in the north to Auckland in the south, and including outlets in Espiritu Santo and Noumea.
As the Pacific war moved northwards, the AFRS stations closed and BSIP listeners returned to tuning to broadcast programmes from Australia or further afield for entertainment and information. In 1946, a rudimentary weekly half hour of news and service bulletins was established by the BSIP Administration. The service was transmitted from Honiara on regular inter-island radio frequencies using Government transmission equipment and soon developed a regular following.
By 1952, the broadcasts were on a much stronger footing and the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Service (SIBS), an arm of the Government, was established. In 1976, new legislation converted the SIBS into the Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation (SIBC), a totally independent public service broadcaster charged with providing national radio coverage and a full range of news, educational and entertainment services.
SIBC's headquarters are located at Rove in Honiara, the capital city of the Solomon Islands. Both Radio Happy Isles' and Wantok FM's studios are located at the headquarters.
Radio Happy Lagoon is located in Gizo, Western Province. It is currently broadcasting on FM after an earthquake damaged the AM infrastructure.
Radio Temotu is located in Lata in the Temotu Province. It is currently not broadcasting, but serves as an important communications link between the remote islands and the capital.
Esther Londu told Radio Hapi Lagun’s Cathy Lezutuni, this was due to commitments from community members on New Year’s day.
Mrs Londu says although two days late, there is actually a worthwhile cause for celebration – their new water tanks.
“We often struggle to collect water every festive season since a lot of people would return home for holidays, but as Chair Lady of the Riguru Community Water Supply I am very excited to announce that a major achievement for us this festive season is 17 water tanks funded by the Rural Development Program.”
Open Carry is carrying a firearm unconcealed in Ohio. OC does not require a concealed handgun license, but the practice requires intimate knowledge of the law since there are places and situations where OC is prohibited but carrying concealed would be permitted. OC is also likely to attract attention. This forum is for discussion of OC, not for debating the pro's and con's or coordinating any type of protest events.
Summer months I turn into something between a sloppy concealed carrier and an open carrier.. T shirt comfort without always remembering to blouse the T over the gun... Today was an open carry, no blousing day apparently.
I saw a local business opening up shop with their new sign on the street stating they were a steel house. Me being a machine shop who works primarily with steel I took great interest.
Out on a delivery and a pick up I made it a point to stop in, introduce myself and see if there was anything we could do for each other. I walked in to find stacks of plate and sheet goods but no one around. Turning around and going back to the front of the place I saw an office with a man looking at me from his desk. I entered the office and handed him my card, introduced myself and explained how I was a neighbor right across the drive and how I had this shop. I asked him exactly what it was he sold but the conversation immediately went off course before he answered.
"You like open carry?" Figuring at this point I'm had I didn't need to look down to see the form of carry I was currently in.
I then start getting a lecture as to how I should have had a badge, how I scare people and how is he supposed to figure out if I mean him harm. I interrupted him and said I was sorry but I didn't see a posting and he said he didn't post.
I'm sorry folks, but sometimes one it just out of breath and tired of touting the cause. I wasn't going to argue. I wasn't going to debate. I wasn't going to lift an eyebrow. I reached over his desk and removed my business card from his hand and wished him well and left.
"A story about a bird stealing a knife from a crime scene...and we're more interested in hearing about the Canadian with a gun.

Its just disheartening to hear the uneducated open their mouths. When one spends so much time in the choir and talking to like minded people for so long, that getting out in the world among the ninnies is an eye opener that says there so much more work to be done.

Like you, I have grown weary of arguing with the sheeple. In the situation where I think I have a decent chance of having a cogent discussion, I'll still take it on, but I no longer try to meet emotion with facts. It simply can't be done. You might as well argue with that computer monitor you're looking at right now (smartphone, whatever). You'll get just as much comprehension and intelligent discourse.

COLUMBUS, Ohio – It took only three weeks into her collegiate career for freshman Hannah Gruensfelder to set an all-time Ohio State school record and a subsequent co-Big Ten Freshman of the Week distinction following her 38-dig performance on Sunday (Sept. 10) at Notre Dame. Wisconsin’s Dana Rettke is the fellow co-Big Ten Freshman of the Week.
Gruensfelder recorded an astonishing 38 digs Sunday versus the Irish, the most ever by a Buckeye in a four-set contest. Gruensfelder’s digging explosion surpassed the previous four-set mark of 35 digs by Valeria Leon versus Arizona in 2015 and is the second-highest total overall (Julie Chellevold dug 41 balls in a five-set match back in 1990). Her season average expands to 5.03 digs per set, good for the top spot in the entire Big Ten Conference. Ohio State’s 109 team digs total versus Notre Dame also cracked the Top-20 in school history. For the week, Gruensfelder was responsible for 7.43 digs per set. In addition, the Buckeye libero successfully handled 32 error-free service receptions.
This marks the eighth time a Buckeye has earned B1G Freshman of the Week honors since 2009 and Gruensfelder is the fifth different player to do so. Current Buckeye Audra Appold was a three-time honoree in 2015 while recently-graduated Taylor Sandbothe picked up the award twice in 2013.
EAST LANSING, Mich. – The eighth-ranked Ohio State field hockey team fell to No. 15 Michigan State by a score of 3-2 Saturday in the final conference game of the year to conclude the regular season schedule. The Buckeyes finish their regular season with a record of 14-5, 3-3 in the Big Ten. The Spartans are 11-7, 2-4 in the conference.
Junior Saskia Mueller (Zuerich, Switzerland/Gymnasium Unterstrass) scored unassisted just 1:54 into the game to give the Buckeyes an early 1-0 lead. The goal was Mueller’s eighth of the season.
Michigan State responded with three goals to go into half time with a 3-1 lead. Amy Schneider scored at 4:43 to tie the game at 1-1. Michelle Huynh-Ba then beat OSU goalkeeper Lindsay Williams (Harrisburg, Pa./Susquehanna Township) twice, at 8:07 and 17:32.
Senior Leticia Fragapane (Mendoza, Argentina/Universidad Nacional De Cuyo) scored at 58:50 to cut the lead to 3-2, with an assist from freshman Linda Haussener (Baden, Switzerland/Kantonsschule Baden). It was the 10th goal of the season for Fragapane, while Haussener collected her second assist. The Buckeyes did not allow a shot to Michigan State in the second half, out-shooting MSU 6-0, but were not able to erase the one-goal deficit as Michigan State held their 3-2 lead for the win.
Overall, the Buckeyes had a 14-7 advantage in shots and a 7-1 margin in penalty corners. Williams made three saves in the OSU cage, while Christina Kirkaldy saved eight of 10 shots for Michigan State.
COLUMBUS, Ohio – The Ohio State women’s golf team fired a 325 Friday in the opening round of the Mercedes-Benz Classic at the par-72 Gettysvue Polo, Golf and Country Club in Knoxville, Tenn. The Buckeyes currently stand in 16th place. Georgia leads the competition by three strokes over South Carolina after firing a nine-over par 297.
These cupcakes have an amazing consistency all-over: the cupcake is moist and rich, and the icing is delicious, smooth and creamy. I used the swiss-meringue buttercream for the icing, and it was a hit! :-)
There are not many things that can beat the whole grain bread, unless it's 8 delicious little whole grain breadrolls ;-) These are perfect for breakfast, and you can easily prepare and bake them in one evening, for e.g. Sunday breakfast! :-)
These are the nicest cupcakes ever: rich in taste, sweet, smooth and creamy, thanks to the fluffy buttercream and luxurious butterscotch surprise. Who would've thought that it's also one of the easiest recipes ever? ;-)
Arcwind Point is an ancient Nordic tomb in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim that resembles a temple, rather than a dungeon.
This area is accessible through two winding mountain passes. One path is to the east of Autumnwatch Tower before reaching Froki's Shack marked with some ancient Nordic ruins.
The other path is directly south of Haemar's Shame. From the fast travel point, a narrow path leads down to the north, but then curves back towards the south. The path leads generally south and east, past Alchemist's Shack. Turning south, just past Rift Imperial Camp, a winding path leads up to the west. At one point, the Dragonborn gets a high view of the point.
If The Elder Scrolls V: Dawnguard is installed, a Word Wall for the Drain Vitality shout will be added West of the coffin on the platform, at the top of a set of steps.
The area around the temple is vast. Two groups of five skeletons can be found patrolling the area. Near the center is a platform with a sarcophagus containing a leveled Draugr Deathlord or Dragon Priest. With Dawnguard installed, a word wall and a dragon will also be located there, often leading to fights between the draugr and the dragon. Upon reaching level 78, however, the dragon will always spawn to be a Legendary Dragon. In the high northeastern section of this area, there is a tower with a few leveled undead. A dragon priest can also spawn at high levels.
Restoration skill book - Withershins – Atop the pedestal found at the top of a dilapidated tower, which can be reached by heading directly north from the dais with the sarcophagus and through the small room with an altar and a log trap (triggered by a clearly-visible pressure plate before entering the chamber), after which a path to the north-east that leads to the book can be found.
If a dragon enters the location, the entombed draugr reanimate to fight it, though draugr are said to be the undead worshipers of dragonkind.
This is one of the few locations in the game where Draugr Deathlords can be met when at lower levels. At higher levels, rare Draugr Death Overlords can be encountered in this location. This is also one of the very few locations where a Hulking Draugr can be found.
This is one of the highest level locations in the game, due to the high level draugr encountered. In Dawnguard, a legendary dragon can be encountered at this location even when at mid-level.
There is a quicksilver ore vein past the arc and guarded by leveled creatures, which could be wolves or even frost trolls (if approaching from Autumnwatch Tower). There is another quicksilver ore vein past the temple, up the long flight of stairs in the flat area with the burial cairns, in the left corner.
There are three areas where one can encounter high-level draugr: the coffin in the burial pit (past the first quicksilver ore vein), the coffin at the "temple," and the coffin on the other side of the building up the stairs from the temple. The draugr in the latter two coffins (especially the one past the temple) are always higher in level than the player character when they visit, i.e., Draugr Scourge Lords or even draugr Death Overlords when level 10.
Even without Dawnguard, a leveled dragon will appear at the area once the "Dragon Rising" quest has been completed.
If having trouble with the draugr, one can run up the stairs past the temple and hop onto the ledge to the right. If far enough away from the stairs, the draugr will not be able to attack the player character, but can be attacked themselves via magic or bows and arrows.
This section contains bugs related to Arcwind Point (Skyrim). Before adding a bug to this list, consider the following:
If the bug is still occurring, please post the bug report with the appropriate system template 360 / XB1 , PS3 / PS4 , PC / MAC , NX , depending on which platform(s) the bug has been encountered on.
PC 360 PS3 NX (Note: This bug does not occur if Dawnguard is not installed) If Arngeir gives Arcwind Point as the location of a Word of Power, finding the word wall and learning the word may not complete the "Find the Word of Power in Arcwind Point" miscellaneous quest objective. The quest marker will remain in front of the word wall. The word wall located at Northwind Summit completes this quest, but only if it has not been previously found.[1]
PC The console command SetStage FreeFormHighHrothgarA 20 can be used to complete the quest, however Arngeir may give the quest again. Setting Arcwind Point as cleared via SetLocationCleared fd685 1 will prevent getting sent there again.
PC 360 PS3 Since finding the word wall at Northwind Summit is the only known way to resolve this bug, this can be avoided by discovering the Arcwind Point word wall before the Northwind Summit one. (in PC SSE 1.4.2.0.8 it greybeards might still give you this wall if you "fixed" this bug by getting Northwind Summit)
PC Arngeir might give the Dragonborn the "Find the Word of Power in Arcwind Point" miscellaneous quest again after the console command to complete the quest has been used. The word at the wall will be glowing, even if already learned, but it won't be able to be "learned" again. The console command may be used again to receive the next word wall location from Arngeir.
XB1 NX If you descend from Haemar's Shame down the mountain to the sarcophagus in Arcwing point, instead of taking the path up from Autumnwatch Tower, the sarcophagus will burst open but no maskless dragon priest or wrath Lord will come out. It will be empty.

Winter in the Woods: David Huebner's Paean-in-Gray to the Sierra Nevada Backcountry, and to Lives Excellently Lived
November issue on stands now."I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE 26TH OF MAY, 1827," wrote legendary fur trapper Jed Smith, having lost eight horses, a mule, and his pistol to a late-season storm on what would later become Sonora Pass.
The next day dawned "clear upon the gleaming peaks": just another bluebird powder day in the High Sierra. If only he'd brought his fat skis.
My note on Sonora, plus five other "Roads to Take You There," and even a quick word on our local custom ski crafter Michael Lish, in the November Travel Issue of Backcountry Magazine, on stands now.
THIS IS THE WAY OF OUR TIMES: A man falls asleep reading a fine account of the rise and fall of the American Newspaper (in words printed on paper, in a magazine), from Gold Rush San Francisco to an equally tenuous present. He wakes to another rosy-fingered dawn over the White Mountains, as in a fable, or not, his children crawling all over him, kneeing him in the groin, laughing, pouting, fighting for his attention, clamoring for juice.
And the dreams go something like this. (The author at work.)Later he takes his coffee (and a pancake formed in the shape of a squirrel by his visiting mother-in-law) to the basement, where, surrounded by exposed insulation, and with the light coming up on the trees outside, he puts off the task at hand—that of writing the texts for a guide to winter adventure in Mammoth, as commissioned by the Ski Area.
He scrolls through the morning's tweets, comes upon the following from (of all possible sources) the Comfort Inn in Bishop (@ComfortInn395):
And so he does, of course, and is immediately transported far beyond his cluttered desk, beyond the world of newspapers and social media and a too-sluggish computer, to an earlier time—a better time, he cannot help but think—and a time very soon to come:
Read part of the story in the September 09 issue of Men's Journal, or online here.“I don’t know where the hell we were—on a bus somewhere,” says Patrick Martin, pro photographer and aging surf dude who by his own account has “done a whole bunch of weird stuff,” but is resolutely not in the business of collecting stamps in his passport. We are sitting at the bar at Nevados, in Mammoth Lakes. “Anywhere in the world you’ll run into those people,” he says, “especially if you go somewhere other people haven’t been.”
He was on one of Bill Altaffer's adventures, on the way to or from Tuva, perhaps, as part of a small cadre of extreme travelers bouncing across a cold, exotic landscape with beautiful women on every corner and no ice for their whiskey. And sure enough, somewhere along the road, a guy got on bearing a U.S. passport fat with ink and border crossings.
“He was some kind of scientist for the government,” Martin recalls, “built an atomic bomb or something, made a lot of money and just started walking.” He had all the stamps: Pakistan. Kazakhstan. Mongolia. “He was like an old dog, wandering. No friends, no life, no nothing—no chicks.”
Photo: André Brigiroux.SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 189 AND 217 nautical miles* off the coast of Yemen (depending on your source of information), and some 130 off the coast of Somalia, like a tiny, glittering tongue-stud in the gaping maw of the Gulf of Aden, lies the legendary island of Socotra (Suquṭra), ancient source of ambergris, dragon's blood, frankincense and myrrh. Its name derives either from the Sanskrit for "Isle of Bliss (or Tranquility)" or from an Arabic mash-up meaning "Market of Dripping Frankincense." Thomas the Apostle made it here, and Marco Polo, and Sinbad the Sailor (though he encountered some big angry birds and lost his ship). "It is one of those unique places in the world," says Spanish toptrotter Jorge Sanchez, founder of the well-respected Travelers Exploits Club, writing from Severobaikals, Buriatia, waiting for a train to Tinda.
THE SHOW KICKS OFF TOMORROW (July 23) and is set to run through the 22nd of August, with the real tour de force sometime around the 12th and 13th of August. Here are a few places (and cool pics) recommended by Hugo Martin at the LA Times last year where a person might lie on his or her back and gape at the sky.
If we can pull it off, we'll be heading for some of the darkest skies in the Southwestern US, high up in one of the following ranges: the Glass, the Whites, the Inyos, the Cosos, the Argus or the Panamints. Maybe we'll see you there.
Walden Pond in SummerTook a rare Friday morning off to join my family for some cold lake water and sunshine at June Lake. It wasn't nearly as crowded as in this shot of Walden Pond, outside of Boston, but the consensus was that our little secret beach paradise in the High Sierra hadn't been quite so busy for as long as anyone could remember. A couple nights earlier the boys and I had been hard-pressed to find 20 feet for the old fuselage at one of the campgrounds down along the San Joaquin. The news reports seem borne out in the field: people are out playing in the Great (Free) Outdoors this summer. And why not?
Beckett and Jasper at June LakeStill, it was hard not to imagine that someone had spilled the beans. Had someone put our favorite beach on TV in Orange County? Which line of thinking got me back into an old, old, useless twist about travel writing and the dangers inherent in sharing the places we love. The result, in part, was a preliminary foray into an online travel magazine/community called matador.

For the last day of this week's marathon under 'Tortilla based dishes' theme, I made rice & beans filled burritos. We love Mexican food and I make it at least once a week. I always keep tortillas in stock for quick wraps, burritos or tacos.
Taco Bell happens to be our favorite fast food restaurant and before you start judging me let me tell you that is the only place where we get a decent choice of vegetarian options. Also they keep adding new items on to their menu unlike other fast food chains where we usually exhaust the dishes to try the first time we visit. Other Mexican fast food places we visit are Qdoba & Chipotle. So moral of the story is we love Mexican food and eat it quite frequently at home and outside.
But I never order burritos when I go out. I feel they get very messy while eating, so usually order burrito bowls instead. Making and eating them at home is much more convenient for me.
Burritos are made with tortillas that are wrapped or folded into a cylindrical shape to completely enclose the filling. Fillings can be anything from flavored or plain rice, refried beans or beans, lettuce, salsa, meat, guacamole, cheese and sour cream.
My burrito recipe has spinach & corn rice, spicy pinto beans and a creamy queso sauce. It has quite a few components, but once you have everything ready, making burritos is a breeze. If you are short on time, then just make plain rice rice and beans, serve with store bought salsa and guacamole. Queso sauce adds cheesy, creamy goodness to the burritos. Do give this recipe a try, I'm sure you'll like it.
Add the rice and 1½~2cups of rice (adjust the quantity of water depending on the type of rice used), bring to a boil, lower the heat, cover and simmer for 15~20 minutes or until rice is cooked through. Set aside to cool.
Add the cooked pinto beans and season with salt & pepper. Add some water if the mixture looks too thick, simmer for 5~10 minutes.
Stir in the milk and let the mixture bubble for a minute. Add cream cheese and cheese, mix well until the cheese melts. Turn off the heat and keep ready.
To make Burritos: Lay the tortilla flat on a surface. Place some rice in the lower half of the tortilla, top it with the beans, then salsa, followed by queso sauce and some avocado pieces. Fold the lower half of the tortilla over the filling, tuck the edges in and flip it over to make the burrito roll. Cut the burrito in half and serve.
Dont torture me like this, burrito looks simply out of the world, wat a super healthy and filling dish.
Burrito bowl at chipotle is my son's favorite. Haven't tried the rest of the places. I am learning a lot of Mexican recipes because of this BM :-)
Pavani I remember making these in my pre blogging days. They were delicious. Must make again.Thnaks for the recipe bookmarking
We love Mexican too ! At home and outside :)) these tortilla series have been so good Pavani !! Well done :)
This series has really tempted me to try the dishes that you posted and this one looks out of the world..
Delicious pavani, i love that colorful rice and the creamy cheesy sauce !! i too made burrito for the theme and loved the combination of rice and beans inside!!
I really appreciate your feedback, so please feel free to leave your comment. I read all the comments you post, but I may not respond to them. Thank you for your time and hope you enjoyed your stay.
As a base, I used the lovely soft pink holographic named "55" from Dance Legend, which is opaque in 3 layers. Then for a powder effect, I applied straight with the brush in the middle of each nail a line of "Just Another Star" still from Dance Legend.

My appearance is changing - I now have two top teeth (it hurt getting those!) as well as 2 on the bottom.

Jonno was actually referred to us by an incredibly tall and stylish friend of mine (I'll leave the name out -- but hopefully I will get to write a blog post on him too, one day soon.)We made him a luxurious Super 150's wool slim-fit suit for the upcoming wedding he'll be attending as well as other subsequent suit-appropriate occasions.
It was Jonno's first custom suit. It's his first--but I believe it will not be his last because he looked pretty darn happy about it:
We're standing by the counter, chatting. I notice Jonno is hugging his suit that I'd already wrapped up for him in a suit bag. It looks like it's slipping away from his grip.
"You sure you don't want me to hang it up? You look sort of uncomfortable and you're crushing your suit. I'll give it back."
This is Ryan Gosling in a custom-made Salvatore Ferragamo shiny blue tuxedo (HELLO!). A real eye-opener, right? Who knew adding a new twist (using the colour blue instead of black) to a classic look could be so FUN? And who knew it would make an already very good-looking man into a jaw-dropping, mouth-watering stunner?
One of our customers had found these pictures of Ryan's slim and shiny blue tux and requested that we make him something similar for his wedding day. So we quickly got to work and here is our rendition:
While Ryan's suit looks like it's made of silk, our version is made of a wool blend (which is very affordable!) that has a subtle sheen which is stylish and beckons for your attention. With this suit on, who needs a horn? ;)
Yup, that's exactly what I said upon meeting Narinder for the very first time. I shook his hand and told him straight up his eyes were stunning. They're as bold as the colour of our Moraine Lake in Baff! Isn't that right, Narinder? (I know you're reading this and nodding!)
This sturdy handsome man came in looking for a simple, sleek three-piece custom suit. As a matter of fact, he was convinced to choose us as his tailors after having read the Balsam blog! :)
Nowadays, the trend is to wear something that is simple and tasteful for your big day so that later on, you can where your outfit again for many other occasions. It's a budget-friendly way to go. Who doesn't want to save money? Have a look at what Narinder chose for his big day: A heather gray wool-blend three-piece, custom-made to perfection with lotsa looooove, guaranteed fit--all under $700! Tell me that is not an attractive price?
What I love most about Narinder is his high level of enthusiasm. I asked if he wanted to be showcased on our blog and he responded, not just positively, but he was brimming with excitement! Haha.. It sure got me excited!
So here's the low-down: Before you get your panties all up in a bunch, just know that that diamond insert is NOT a defect nor is it there just for show (Haha! That's right! Keep those legs close ladies and gents!)
That geometrical piece of fabric is called a diamond gusset. It helps to reinforce the seams at the crotch because the way our bodies move and how we position ourselves create a lot of tension in that area. That's tension in the seams, people. Get your mind out of the gutter please :)
The diamond gusset makes the crotch bigger (Alright, you don't need to go there. Let's keep it professional.) but not deeper so that it impedes movement. The result is a slack crotch in the pant which allows plenty of room of your legs to open up in. For example, you will find that it is common for motorcycle riders with jeans that have diamond gussets in them because of the way they have to sit on their motorcycles. If they didn't have the diamond insert, they may find the jeans intensely uncomfortable since there will be a lot of horizontal pulling right in that area.
Pants that you may find diamond gussets in are: rockclimbing pants, dancing tights, martial art uniform pants, horseback riding pants and basically others that are made specifically for you to move in comfort when you're doing stuff that requires you to stretch out your legs and groins.
Custom tailors also make use of this diamond gusset feature to help make dress pants comfortable for their clients. Men who carry a little more weight and have a wider seat area or thicker thighs will appreciate this feature.
I have had hundreds of customers who come into our store to have dress pants or jeans repaired in the crotch. That is one area where rips and tears are prone to happen. Unfortunately, most denim jeans or dress pants that you buy at retail stores don't have the diamond gusset feature. Overtime, all that stretching and thigh-rubbing will put holes into your beloved pants.
Both sides of the inner thighs were torn badly due to continuous pulling and rubbing but they're now nicely patched up!
Here's another jacket we made for the customer who brought in the several yards of vintage brocade (refer to previous post). I LOOOOVE THIS ONE. This one is Anda's design :)
One of our customers asked us what she could do with several pieces of her late mother-in-law's precious silk brocade. She didn't want it to just sit in a wooden chest where the moths could get at it. There was one particular piece that stood out from the rest--that I personally really liked. This cloth was a lustrous powder-ink silk speckled with old Chinese script. It definitely was a very feminine style of brocade.
The customer didn't want to have a piece made that she could only wear on very rare occasions because then it would just sit in her closet most of the time--meaning it would be no different than just having the original piece of brocade cloth sitting in the wooden chest. The precious cloth needed to be worn and shown off!
I thought: She needs something versatile and fun so she would be comfortable wearing it and not feel too overdressed since brocade is such a luxurious and ornate kind of material. An idea popped into my head: Tuxedo-style Jacket! That's fun, very chic, and super versatile. She could wear it as a statement piece paired with some nice jeans or with a black skirt forming a girlie skirt-suit or with a pair of dressy shorts and heels. The possibilities are endless really. :)
This dress was bought from a widely known "fast-food" fashion store for under $30. But the alterations to be performed on this dress cost $38. The girl, who is even smaller than I am (and I'm what you call "petite" already), bought it one size too big because it was the last one left. She loved it and thought it'd be reasonable to drop another $38 to have it tailored to her body shape. The total cost of this dress is now $68--still a very reasonable price when you know you're getting something that actually fits you.
In the last several years, with so many "fast-food" fashion chain stores and online clothing stores churning out average to subpar quality items at such irresistibly low prices, how can trend-followers not gobble up what these clothing companies are throwing at them?
In all honesty, I'm guilty of being part of the fast-food fashion culture. I'm not entirely immersed in it--maybe with just my feet in and only ankle-deep. If I can get the same style for much less than what mid-range to high-end clothing stores offer, why not?
When it comes to buying clothes, keep your head on straight: Keep in mind, what you pay is what you get--so don't go nuts and start hoarding when something is cheap. Think before you buy! Because market researchers know that most trend followers prefer quantity over quality, clothing companies can shirk and make compromises in the fabric quality as well as workmanship that goes into making fast-food clothes. Why else are you paying $20 for a dress instead of $100?
The general rule of thumb is, when you're trying to dress nice and save money, invest in KEY pieces of excellent quality that can stand the test of time and occasionally buy cheaper trend items to enhance your overall outfit.
From time to time, you may get suckered into buying something you don't even need and probably doesn't even fit because it was "on sale". This happens a lot to our customers. It happens to me. You're stuck with a nice $50 jacket but the sleeves are too long and fits a tad too big. You have three options:
1.Wear it the way it is and hope that nobody notices the bad fit ( If you pick this option, congratulations! You have the courage that I don't have.)
2. Use the money you saved on the jacket and make it fit you perfectly. (If you pick this option, congratulations! You'll actually get some wear out of it and look good sporting it.)
3. Shove it into the back of your closet and pretend you never even bought it. (If you pick this option, congratulations! You just wasted $50.)
1. Those who think, "Wow, I saved this much. I can use what I saved and put it towards alterations to get a perfect fit. Customers who fall into this category usually really like their purchases and that's why they can justify spending more on a sale item.
2. Those who think, "What?! I paid only $50 for this jacket. Why on earth would I spend more on it?" Customers who fall into this category usually DON'T really like their purchases all that much and that's why they CANNOT justify spending more on a sale item. If you know you belong in this category, let me ask you this question: Why do you buy things that don't even look good on you? :(
So to answer a common question that I get working here, "Should I spend more fixing this thing I got at such a low price or should I just leave it and either not wear it at all or just wear it the way it is?", you need to ask yourself how much you like what you bought and as well, these complimentary questions:
As much as I love working with men's clothing, I still get really excited when Balsam Tailors get asked to make really beautiful girlie things! Many people know us as a custom suit/shirt and fine tailoring store but once in a while, we have people who like to challenge us--AND WE LOVE THAT!
Jody had an idea of what her prom dress should look like. But because of time constraint and sizing issues, she couldn't get the dress she wanted in the ready-made version. She came to us and presented her idea.
I fell in love with her idea. It's something I would totally wear...it's simple, elegant, airy, sparkly and sexy!
Over the month of April, Balsam Tailors had been busy working to prepare for a photoshoot with a couple of finely selected young men. It's that time of the year when the pictures need to be updated, in order to reflect our stylish, refined and high-quality custom products. Mosey on over to our website and check out our gorgeous selection of men, errr...I mean gorgeous hand-made garments! I hope these pictures will inspire you to get something unique made and that you will wear proudly--because at Balsam Tailors, we're all about making you look and feel amazing! :)
I'm really a big fan of blazers. Whether you're a guy or a girl, you really have no excuse to not have a blazer in your closet. A clean, simple blazer with a slim-cut is a staple closet item. It never goes out of style, ever!
Gents, if you have a full suit, consider wearing it as separates like Nathan. What he has done here is literally mix a business suit jacket with a casual shirt and jeans to create a hip and urban look.
A lean cut means the jacket should hug your curves, including the small of your back. Lean does not mean undersized. Lean does not mean uncomfortable. If you get pulling in the front of the jacket when you have the top button done up, that means it's too tight!
Black and white shirt with white cuffs and collars! My FAVOURITE COMBO. So glad I convinced him to get one made! No more boring white shirts, Nathan!
Here's a tiny sneak peek of our new and VERY FUN wardrobe for the upcoming Balsam Tailors photoshoot. Nice custom clothes: Check! Good-looking models: Check! Great attitude: Check!

With its mid-century design and an exposed reservoir, you'll want to leave the Moccamaster out on the counter even when it’s not in use. But it doesn't just look great. Indeed, the pricey Moccamaster brews a complex and smooth pot of coffee that ranked highest in our taste test. This machine also fills a full pot quickly—a necessity for the morning rush.
To ensure that our customers get the best coffee makers for their needs, our expert team here at Seattle Coffee Gear tests and reviews all items in our inventory. With us, you can be sure that you’re making a quality investment, no matter which coffee maker you choose. Use the links below for further assistance in the buying process, and shop with us today!
It scored the highest in our out-of-the-box taste test, brewing coffee our tasters described as “light” with subtle notes of blueberry, citrus, cherry, tobacco, and hazelnut. The machine simply brews great coffee, and it takes its job seriously. If you’re interested in playing around with the flavor and extraction of your roast, the Behmor Brazen gives you more access to more variables. You can adjust water temperature, play with pre-infusion times (15 seconds to four minutes) — it even has you enter your altitude to better determine water’s boiling point, and calibrate its internal thermometer during setup.
Our brew-performance tests measure the brew temperature and contact time (how long water stays within a sweet spot of 195° to 205° F for brewing). We measure concentration using a refractometer, a device that measures the amount of coffee dissolved in each brew. Our convenience tests look at how easy it is to set timers, fill the reservoir, clean the machine, and more. And for the first time, we’re incorporating predicted reliability and owner satisfaction ratings into the new Overall Score for each model. We determine these ratings for each drip coffee maker brand using survey data collected from thousands of CR members.
Regardless of whether you buy extra accessories, it's still very affordable, and you're really buying this machine for the espresso. The De'Longhi delivers in that regard. It's a 15 bar machine with a self-priming function, so you don't have to go through the hassle of prepping the machine. The 35oz water tank is removable for cleaning and it has a drip tray to catch spills. and a durable, high-quality stainless steel boiler to ensure many years of delicious espresso.
Expresso Coffee Makers are for sale in different capacities, controls, and sizes. Compare various items made in Italy and China. Look for colors like black and silver as well as others. Search eBay listings for a range of favored brands, including DeLonghi. Expresso Coffee Makers are available in new, manufacturer refurbished, or seller refurbished condition, so you can realize excellent value. Plus, automatic coffee makers are great for producing your coffee without any trouble.
A drip coffee system is far superior to an instant coffee maker. For some, the smoother, less intense taste and aroma of a drip coffee system is a lot more palatable than the bitter coffee that tends to be produced by a French press. Not only that, but a drip coffee system is versatile – you can ground up your coffee beans to use in your system, and you can also buy premade blends.
Whole bean coffee that you grind yourself is preferable to pre-ground, too. The bean’s exterior traps and protects all of the delicate, volatile, and water-soluble oils that give coffee its flavor. As soon as you break the protective shell, it’s easy for the flavor to get contaminated, and much of the aroma escapes as soon as the oils are exposed to air.
This multi-functional brewer uses espresso, coffee, tea and milk pods to give you drinks just like your favorite barista makes. The machines automatically uses different levels of pressure to create various beverages, such as high-pressure extraction for espresso to low pressure for regular coffee. The sleek design will look right at home on your counter, and the water reservoir can be detached for easy refills.
Like the OXO machines, it has only one button on its interface. Unlike the OXO machines, that button does only one thing: start the brewing process. If you hold it down until it blinks, you’ll activate the pre-infusion; otherwise a simple click gets it going. Brewing a full pot of eight cups took us about seven minutes, by far the fastest of any of our top picks — which is a good thing, considering you can’t program it to start brewing before you wake up.
One of the many issues with other coffee makers is that the brewing process is inconsistent, with temperature fluctuations that can potentially affect the acidity, aroma, and final flavor of your beverage. The OXO On Barista Brain Coffee Maker is fixed with an intelligent microprocessor that monitors ambient temperatures throughout the brewing process.
Great for active, busy lifestyles, it’s Great for active, busy lifestyles, it’s the BLACK+DECKER Personal Coffeemaker. It brews single Servings of your favorite coffee directly into the 16-oz. Travel mug, which fits most car cup, holders. The permanent grounds filter is compatible with coffee grounds and pre-packaged soft pods, and it’s easy to rinse clean in the sink.

From 1-cup coffee makers to 60-cup coffee urns, automatic drip coffee makers to french press coffee makers, we design and expertly engineer our coffee machines to fit your lifestyle and brew a perfect cup of coffee, every time. Some of our coffee innovations include our FlexBrew® coffee makers, designed to let you drink a cup of coffee from a single-serve pack or from coffee grounds, in a single cup or a 12-cup carafe. Our collection of BrewStation® coffee makers ignore the carafe completely and internalize the brewing system, allowing you to pour a fresh cup of coffee with one-hand. Other innovations like easy access filling, programmable settings, and automatic grounds filling make our coffee makers uniquely qualified to improve your every morning.
CR’s take: The Cuisinart Coffee on Demand is a self-serve model. It stores 12 cups of brewed coffee in a reservoir and has a dispenser instead of a carafe. It makes sense in homes where people are drinking coffee at different times; it keeps coffee hot and ready, so family and guests can fill their own cups. This model is programmable and features a water filter and a cleaning indicator. The reservoir can be removed for washing. In our tests, the Coffee on Demand performs quite well, receiving a Very Good rating for convenience. At less than $100, it can be a terrific choice for entertaining.
The method for making coffee in a percolator had barely changed since its introduction in the early part of the 20th century. However, in 1970 General Foods Corporation introduced Max Pax, the first commercially available "ground coffee filter rings". The Max Pax filters were named so as to compliment General Foods' Maxwell House coffee brand. The Max Pax coffee filter rings were designed for use in percolators, and each ring contained a pre-measured amount of coffee grounds that were sealed in a self-contained paper filter. The sealed rings resembled the shape of a doughnut, and the small hole in the middle of the ring enabled the coffee filter ring to be placed in the metal percolator basket around the protruding convection (percolator) tube.
*SCAA Certified: A Specialty Coffee Association of America certification indicates the machine can heat water to a temperature between 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit and ensures that hot water will be in contact with coffee grounds for no less than four and no greater than eight minutes. It’s a solid confirmation of quality. But according to Joseph Rivera, a research coffee scientist at coffeechemistry.com, not every manufacturer chooses to submit their coffee makers for SCAA certification, and there are definitely great drip coffee makers out there without its stamp of approval. Six of the 10 coffee makers we tested are SCAA-certified — including all four of our top picks.
Drip-style coffee makers already have a bit of a flavor handicap when compared with other brewing methods, like pour-over and French press, which give coffee drinkers ultimate control over every aspect of the brewing (and therefore extraction) process. This makes it even more important to select a high-quality coffee bean for your at-home drip coffee maker. To learn more, we spoke with Saadat Awan at Woodcat Coffee in Los Angeles.
Access the world of coffee for inspiration. The De’Longhi combination coffee espresso machine allows you to use either coffee pods for a speedy messfree espresso, or freshly ground beans if you prefer your coffee brewed the traditional way. Espresso is delivered straight to the cup in seconds, perfect every time. The distinct sign of an ideal espresso is its ‘crema’, a creamy, toffee-colored layer that seals in flavor. Your De’Longhi espresso machine will deliver a crema that reflects the quality of the espresso, and the machine that made it. Fancy topping your espresso with a sweet milk foam? It’s easy to brew creamy lattes and velvety cappuccinos too, thanks to our patented cappuccino system frothers.
An electric drip coffee maker can also be referred to as a dripolator. It normally works by admitting water from a cold water reservoir into a flexible hose in the base of the reservoir leading directly to a thin metal tube or heating chamber (usually, of aluminum), where a heating element surrounding the metal tube heats the water. The heated water moves through the machine using the thermosiphon principle. Thermally-induced pressure and the siphoning effect move the heated water through an insulated rubber or vinyl riser hose, into a spray head, and onto the ground coffee, which is contained in a brew basket mounted below the spray head. The coffee passes through a filter and drips down into the carafe. A one-way valve in the tubing prevents water from siphoning back into the reservoir. A thermostat attached to the heating element turns off the heating element as needed to prevent overheating the water in the metal tube (overheating would produce only steam in the supply hose), then turns back on when the water cools below a certain threshold. For a standard 10-12 cup drip coffeemaker, using a more powerful thermostatically-controlled heating element (in terms of wattage produced), can heat increased amounts of water more quickly using larger heating chambers, generally producing higher average water temperatures at the spray head over the entire brewing cycle. This process can be further improved by changing the aluminum construction of most heating chambers to a metal with superior heat transfer qualities, such as copper.
Just getting into this whole “home barista” thing? Start off with the Delonghi BC0330T Combination Drip Coffee and Espresso Machine for pro level features that won’t break the bank. This machine pulls espresso shots, though it isn’t pod compatible like its big brother, the Café Nero (see above), and the “Swivel Jet” frother makes rich, creamy lattes and cappuccinos. It will brew 10 cups of drip coffee, and you can choose the strength of your java with the Accuflavor selector dial. Whether you opt for espresso or coffee, the advanced water filtration system eliminates chlorine for a tasty sip. Other convenient features found on more advanced models include a 24-hour programmable digital timer, pause and serve functionality, as well as a removable water tank for easy fill ups.

“My absolute love of the DeLonghi Magnifica ESAM3300 is hard to describe. It has been a faithful, crema-steeped friend and morning ritual for at least eight years, and the current unit I bought as a replacement last week (another ESAM3300) is a testament to why I give this well-built Italian stallion and ‘super automatic’ espresso dream machine a SOLID five-star rating. With very few adjustments and some good Italian or locally roasted whole beans, the Magnifica consistently puts out shot after shot of delicious espresso that will FAR exceed anything you could get at most coffee shops. I always use many of the yummy Lavazza beans, including the Super Crema, Gold Selection, and others that work really well with this machine. The Illy beans are also a nice pairing for this superb machine. The key is, you want nonoily and fairly dry beans (as other reviewers have said here already).”
If all you’re looking for is a gorgeous cup of coffee and no fuss, we strongly recommend the Bonavita BV1900TS. It’s the smallest machine among our top picks and, at $190, the cheapest. Even better, it ranked in the top three out of 10 during our taste tests. It’s also the simplest and most straightforward: one button you click to start brewing, and that’s it. You can’t program brew times; you can’t play around with water temperature; and it even lacks some convenient touches like a brew basket that attaches to the machine (when you’re done brewing, you have to place the brew basket on a plate or in the sink before it makes a total mess). But it’s by far the fastest machine out of our top picks, brewing up a full eight-cup pot in under six minutes. It’s a straightforward, high-end coffee maker that leaves little to complain about.
Expert reviewers and buyers alike love this espresso machine. BravoTV wrote a review explaining why it's worth the money even though it's pricey. Indeed, when you do the math to calculate just how much money you spend over the course of a year on espresso, cappuccinos, and other high-end coffee drinks, you'll see just how much money this admittedly expensive machine will save you in the long run.
When you’re looking for an espresso maker, you have a few different options. Electric espresso makers are popular choices, and they make creating your own espresso drinks quick and easy. This type of machine feeds pressurized water through a series of tubes in the device, heats it up and then feeds it through compacted grounds. Most electric espresso machines include milk frothing wands, which use steam to create delicious foamy milk or cream that’s ideal for cappuccinos or lattes. Many machines are fully automatic, so there isn’t much of a learning curve involved. A few even include built-in coffee mills, offering fresh coffee with zero effort.
The OXO On 12-Cup feels high-tech without being high maintenance. It’s beautifully constructed, with silicone gaskets, a stainless steel carafe, and sturdy-feeling plastic. But let’s go ahead and get its biggest downside right out there in the open. Of the 10 machines we tested, it took the longest to brew eight cups of coffee — nearly 15 minutes. It heats its entire reservoir of water to temperature before a drop touches the grounds, and if you’re jonesing for a full pot to start off your day, that wait is going to feel like a lifetime. This was particularly noticeable considering four of the machines we tested brewed the same amount of coffee in less than half that time. The Bunn BTX-B Velocity Brew could do it in three minutes flat.
If you make your coffee at home, you want to make sure that you’re getting a great-tasting and convenient cup of coffee whenever possible. The best way to do this is to invest in the right equipment. In the home, no piece of coffee equipment is more important than the coffee maker. In most cases, you add the water and the grounds, and the coffee maker takes care of the rest. With many types of coffee makers available on the market today—including French presses, stovetop makers, pour overs and traditional drip coffee brewers—it can be difficult to choose the right one for your needs.
Breville's 12-cup Precision Brewer is stacked with features that allow you to fully customize your coffee, like adjustable brew temperature, bloom time, strength and more. It also has settings for making cold brew, iced coffee, or the Specialty Coffee Association's standard Golden Cup. It's beautifully designed thanks to its sleek brushed stainless steel exterior and LED-lit digital display. Just note that you'll have to spend time exacting your preferred settings, especially when you first set it up.
The Moccamaster isn't for everyone. Handmade in the Netherlands, it costs around $300—and would never win an award for value. It lacks a programmable timer, and it was also bit more difficult to set up than the rest of the coffee makers—in fact most were ready to go right out of the box. But a quick look at the instruction diagram should clear up any confusion, and the end result is well worth the effort.
*When you buy a machine with coffee credits you will receive a code with credits to buy coffee from curated roasters in the Spinn app. The credits will be uploaded in your account settings of the app. The credits allow for easy browsing and discovery of local and national coffee roasters. The credits will be used for automatically ordering when your Spinn machine is running low.
We've researched everything you need to know about buying a shiny new espresso machine for your home and we've combed through the details and reviews for dozens of machines so you don't have to. Before we get into the best espresso machines you can buy for your home, let's take a look at all the key terms and information that you need to know to make an informed purchase.
Pierce's design was later improved by U.S. appliance engineers Ivar Jepson, Ludvik Koci, and Eric Bylund of Sunbeam in the late 1930s. They altered the heating chamber and eliminated the recessed well which was hard to clean. They also made several improvements to the filtering mechanism. Their improved design of plated metals, styled by industrial designer Alfonso Iannelli, became the famous Sunbeam Coffeemaster line of automated vacuum coffee makers (Models C-20, C-30, C40, and C-50). The Coffeemaster vacuum brewer was sold in large numbers in the United States during the years immediately following World War I.
All the machines we tested came with either insulated carafes or glass pots with built-in warmers. Both have pros and cons. Glass pots are typically easier to clean because they tend to have wider mouths, and the lack of internal insulation means that glass pots will have a greater interior volume relative to its exterior volume — basically, it’s easier to get your hand or dish sponge into a glass pot. On the other hand, glass pots are more fragile and have to be heated from a base plate. In our tests, those base plates could even raise the temperature of the coffee, like with the CuisinArt, which can make coffee taste burnt.
6 month warranty for Spinn Original, Original Plus, and Original pro. If your machine is defective (DOA) when you receive it, we’ll make it right immediately. For US customers, if it develops a problem later that’s our fault, we’ll either (at our option) ship you the parts that need to be replaced along with detailed instructions, or ship it back to us for repair or replacement – in either case, for free, including shipping. For international customers, parts and repairs are free, but shipping is not included. The warranty covers everything except water filters. Unfortunately, if you modify your firmware, we can’t cover your Spinn under warranty (because it’s easy to break your Spinn by modifying your firmware!)
Because the coffee grounds remain in direct contact with the brewing water and the grounds are filtered from the water via a mesh instead of a paper filter, coffee brewed with the cafetiere captures more of the coffee's flavour and essential oils, which would become trapped in a traditional drip brew machine's paper filters.[3] As with drip-brewed coffee, cafetiere coffee can be brewed to any strength by adjusting the amount of ground coffee which is brewed. If the used grounds remain in the drink after brewing, French pressed coffee left to stand can become "bitter", though this is an effect that many users of cafetiere consider beneficial. For a 1⁄2-litre (0.11 imp gal; 0.13 US gal) cafetiere, the contents are considered spoiled, by some reports, after around 20 minutes.[4] Other approaches consider a brew period that may extend to hours as a method of superior production.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, although some coffee makers tended to uniformity of design (particularly stovetop percolators), others displayed a wide variety of styling differences. In particular, the vacuum brewer, which required two fully separate chambers joined in an hourglass configuration, seemed to inspire industrial designers. Interest in new designs for the vacuum brewer revived during the American Arts & Crafts movement with the introduction of "Silex" brand coffee makers, based on models developed by Massachusetts housewives Ann Bridges and Mrs. Sutton. Their use of Pyrex solved the problem of fragility and breakability that had made this type of machine commercially unattractive. During the 1930s, simple, clean forms, increasingly of metal, attracted positive attention from industrial designers heavily influenced by the functionalist imperative of the Bauhaus and Streamline movements. It was at this time that Sunbeam's sleek Coffeemaster vacuum brewer appeared, styled by the famous industrial designer Alfonso Iannelli. The popularity of glass and Pyrex globes temporarily revived during the Second World War, since aluminum, chrome, and other metals used in traditional coffee makers became restricted in availability.
If you're highly particular about how your coffee tastes, you'll want the Behmor Brazen Plus. It was the only drip machine we tested that brewed at the optimal temperature to bring out the best flavor from coffee beans. Getting this perfect brew takes a little more time to set up than most coffee makers require— before starting, you have to calibrate it for the altitude in your area— but overall it's easy to use.
The impact of science and technological advances as a motif in post-war design was eventually felt in the manufacture and marketing of coffee and coffee-makers. Consumer guides emphasized the ability of the device to meet standards of temperature and brewing time, and the ratio of soluble elements between brew and grounds. The industrial chemist Peter Schlumbohm expressed the scientific motif most purely in his "Chemex" coffeemaker, which from its initial marketing in the early 1940s used the authority of science as a sales tool, describing the product as "the Chemist's way of making coffee", and discussing at length the quality of its product in the language of the laboratory: "the funnel of the CHEMEX creates ideal hydrostatic conditions for the unique... Chemex extraction." Schlumbohm's unique brewer, a single Pyrex vessel shaped to hold a proprietary filter cone, resembled nothing more than a piece of laboratory equipment, and surprisingly became popular for a time in the otherwise heavily automated, technology-obsessed 1950s household.

I was throwing down $4 on each cup, five times a week — that's over $1,000 a year. A few years ago, a friend from Austria — they really know coffee over there — introduced me to a single-serve coffee maker that could produce a super high-quality cup of coffee in less than one minute. I was dubious when he handed me the drink at his home, but I took a sip and was blown away by how good it tasted.

very surprised that you did not include the Behmor Brazen Plus Temp Controlled Coffeemaker. Better price then many that you have listed and it offers so many extras, including a pre-soak. I buy pricey coffee, even Geshas when affordable so need a good coffee maker and suggest testors try this one too to see if they feel it is worthy of adding to the list
For hundreds of years, making a cup of coffee was a simple process. Roasted and ground coffee beans were placed in a pot or pan, to which hot water was added, followed by attachment of a lid to commence the infusion process. Pots were designed specifically for brewing coffee, all with the purpose of trying to trap the coffee grounds before the coffee is poured. Typical designs feature a pot with a flat expanded bottom to catch sinking grounds and a sharp pour spout that traps the floating grinds. Other designs feature a wide bulge in the middle of the pot to catch grounds when coffee is poured.
So while yes, $150 (current price as I review this item) is a good chunk of change, I honestly believe it’s worth it. This is a high-quality machine that will hopefully last a very, very long time. The quality of the espresso is very good, and in the long run, it will save you the cost of espresso-based drinks at the coffee shop. It all evens out in the end! If you are considering buying this, my advice is to just do it. It’s worth it! Love love love!”

The Bonavita Coffee Brewer performs stellar when it comes to coffee drip brewing, easily outpacing more expensive coffee makers. It'll take about six minutes to create 44 ounces of coffee. Brisk brewing has caught the attention of the Specialty Coffee Association of America, since it's threshold for recognition is a brewing time of fewer than eight minutes.
†Programmable Brew Time: Conventional wisdom frowns at grinding beans early and programming a pot to brew later. The aromatic compounds in coffee beans start to oxidize as quickly as 15 minutes after grinding, which causes coffee to start losing aroma and flavor. But Michael Ebert, senior consultant at Firedancer Coffee Consultants, LLC, assured us that, given the trade-offs for convenience, “grinding the night before will still make a great coffee — just not as great as it could be.” Seven of the 10 pots we tested are programmable, including three of our top picks (all but the Bonavita).
CR’s take: This Cuisinart drip coffee maker with a stainless steel finish and glass carafe earns an Excellent rating for brew performance. It’s programmable and features a water filter, a permanent coffee filter, cleaning mode, a cleaning indicator, and auto-shutoff. The machine also allows you to adjust the strength of your brew. For the money, this model offers style and features that are hard to beat. If you can live without the built-in grinder of the Cuisinart Burr Grind & Brew above, you can save yourself some money and still enjoy Cuisinart quality for a lot less.

After upgrading my HD3850 to a 8800GT, I noticed my system was making an annoying whining type sound when I had my head turned at certain angles. Conveniently it was at every angle facing my desk. I spent an hour moving it to different parts of the desk, the floor, angling it parallel to my monitor - you name it, I tried it. So I gave up, thinking I'm going to have to try a HD3870 instead.
Later, I went to the system tray to close uTorrent but I accidently closed Trillian instead. Amazingly, the whining stopped when I did this. That's right, my instant messaging client was causing my system to whine. I never turn it off and it's set to start up on log-in. W. T. F.
Update: some online video sites also make it whine... seems like the integrated NIC or southbridge is the problem.
I get a bit of harddisk seek noise when loading utorrent, but whining, not so much. Odd things are happening in your PC
I've had some from integrated audio on an nForce 2 board. Never heard of NICs being faulty in that way. Solved it by switching to a separate audio card. Does Trillian initiate sound? Don't know what else it would do to stress power coils or the like.
Yeah... I can basically use Trillian as a switch to make it whine. I must be really sensitive to these things because no one else I know can hear it. Guess thats what happens when you hang around SPCR too long. I will try a discrete NIC later today.
I've had my old newsgroup program make my video card whine when display background was white. Reversing the background to black made it go away. Note: this was inside the actual window, not the desktop background.
I've had SOMETHING whine in my old PC when I played Civilization III and used the in-game scrollbars. Just that. It couldn't be heard anywhere else.
I retired a 5 port 100MBs network switch after a year of service because one of the ports had a stroke... the port would sing (well, a loud tone) and if there was any ethernet activity the tone would fluctuate between a couple different pitches.
Every time I fire up the game Crysis Demo, my PC emits a high pitch. It happened after I installed a new 8800GT, so i believe it is the video card rather than some other component.
I've come across graphics cards that were indeed in such throes that they'd whine with certain signals, like a white background or scrolling. Or was that the monitor...
This kind of whining almost always comes from a power supply (either the main supply, or one of the VRMs on the motherboard or graphics card). It is typically load dependent, and most often happens at relatively low loads (but rarely at idle).
The root cause is that these supplies are switching power supplies, which means that they alternate between full voltage and zero voltage at a variable but usually high frequency, feeding through some inductors into a set of capacitors to smooth the output voltage. The noise you hear is when the on/off frequency chosen by the switcher corresponds to the physical resonance of one of the downstream parts (typically an inductor).
Sometimes you can get rid of the sound with some epoxy, but this is neither certain nor particularly easy.
Getting a very similar noise from my 8800GT whenever I run any 3D-intensive game, but it's less of a whine. More of a high frequency whoosh. Very hard to describe ... it's far less annoying, however, than typical PSU coil whine.
What's even weirder is that the fan controller on the card isn't involved: it's passively cooled with an AC Accelero S1.
My screen, a Viewsonic VG712s has built in speakers. If i have those connected to the computer, whenever I move the mouse there's a sound, a bit like a slow rather quiet electrical shaver. If i use the same audio port with any other speakers, i get great audio. Feel free to speculate
First off, I don't mind how the P183 looks. But the thing that's stopping me from buying it for my new i7 system is I can't find anything factual about its noise levels compared to its well documented predecessor, just speculation that it's "probably" noisier because of the more open front. Benchmarkreviews have the only good in depth review I could find but sadly they didn't really talk about noise at all.
Should I just buy a P182 and be assured of noise levels (at the cost of airflow), or can anyone comment on P183?
I personally would go with the P182. I like the looks more, but this isn't the only reason why I'd go with it. As you said, the P183 may be noisier because it is a lot more open. The P182 does have less airflow, but it is fine to cool my overclocked Q9550 and Radeon HD4850 perfectly with only one fan, so I'd imagine it'd be alright.
Actually, if the looks *really* aren't a factor I'd say go with the P183. It comes with some very handy improvements to the P182 such as moving the lower chamber fan to the front of the lower hard drive bay. Also, all of the unnecessary grills in the back have been removed. Now there's only the vented PCI slot covers and the exhaust fan. All those stupid holes by the PSU have been removed so it properly sucks air from the front now. Just about the only downsides you've mentioned already: looks and maybe more noise. The former you don't care about, and the latter can be remedied by just plugging up a few holes with sound insulating material.
So 50/50 with comments so far, pretty much replicates what's going on in my head. What I'm dreading is I go for the 183 then shortly after this site comes out with its own in depth review revealing it's lost a lot of its acoustic strengths. But of course if it turns out the opposite I'll regret not buying one, because I like its changes that were mentioned above. Was hoping someone on here had one by now.
I'm planning on mildly ocing my i7 920 and there'll be a gtx275 in there, as well as probably a WD Caviar Black drive which I hear are noisy buggers. The more open front could be a problem mainly with that latter part. Can't think of an easy way to cover up those long side grills.
Antec must have hired designers from Thermalsh*t considering direction they're taking look of their cases.
If anything I was surprised that I could hear full stroke seek noises outside damping mat lined Lian Li A71 only when listening from close distance.
I think this forum is part of the minority that likes the look of the P180/P182. I've seen more people complaining on other forums that it looks too plain.
Still, I don't think the little weird shaped vents on the 183 ruin it that much, I mean it only looks crap in flash photos where the stuff behind them really stands out. It does look awful with the door open but then you're not going to have to leave the door open at all with the new vents.
In any case, if a case is cool and quiet I don't care what it looks like, it'll be hidden as much as possible to the side of my desk to cut down on noise anyway.
I wonder if the 1TB versions (WD1001FALS) are noiser than the 640GB? Silentpc's review of the former kind of scared me. But I guess I should post that in the storage section.
I would go for the P183 if it's only about functionality. It has better airflow, and they moved the bottom chamber fan to the front.
The reason is that the overall reduced air flow resistance will allow weaker, and thus less noisy, cooling to be used. That will reduce the amount of generated noise. Then a slightly larger portion of it will be heard.
Another point: If the front door of P183 is considered the major problem, it could probably be replaced by a door for P180 or P182. (I asked Antec's EU support about this a while back. They couldn't say for sure, cause they hadn't seen the new case yet, but agreed with me that it did seem plausible.)
I myself is planning to buy either P182 or P183 within a few months. I'd generally prefer P183 for the improved air flow, not least thanks to the lowered PSU seating, but it will ultimately come to a price issue. Right now the P183 is offered at some $30 above P182.
Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and pick up a P183. Nice to see you from the benchmarkreviews forum Olle.
My main concern was getting a noisy WD Black would be more of an issue with the P183, but looking back at P182 reviews there really isn't *that* much less path for noise to get out near the bottom. For some reason I thought the P182 didn't have those vents along the sides of the door but it does.
But that depends of course on how much somebody likes modding, and how valuable they consider their time...
I now have the P183 sitting in its box next to me, and I'm very glad I chose it because I've decided to buy an Antec CP-850 PSU to go with it that doesn't fit in the 182 (without even more modding anyway). I also bought a Samsung F1 1TB instead of the WD Black so I don't have to worry about noise from that. This case/psu combo should last me many many years and upgrades, I'll report on its noise once I get all the other parts early next week.
It won't be finished as nice as factory made though, unless you're some really serious hardcore modder...
one of the things that sux when you mod steel cases is the miniscule shards of metal that accumulate.
I've never had any problem with that. A few concentrated blows with compressed air does the trick nicely.
I've recently purchased this case, its currently being shipped. I only realized that it has 2 fans after i bought it! I was wondering if it I would need a fan for the front mid chamber?
I was planning on running an i7 920 (mild o/c to ~3.2), HD 4870, one hdd in the lower chamber along with a corsair tx850 psu.
Would I do fine without any additional fans? If not should I get 1 for the lower chamber only, or 1 for the mid chamber only? Or do both? I don't want it to be too loud, but I do want to keep everything cool! Isn't that everyone's goal?
Dough, you most probably won't need any more fans, and might even consider removing one of the already installed (blocking the place where it is mounted).
The PSU fan will take care of all required cooling in the lower chamber, and provided you use the stock cooler on the graphics card, that will work in concert with the case fan(s) to draw air from the front.
Only if you have a GPU cooler that spread hot air all over the place could it be necessary to have an intake fan.
I currently own a P182, I love it, though I have a love/hate relationship with the door, I love it that it hides the HDD light, I hate it when I have to use my DVD drives for any reason, but thats just an annoyance, what I really hate is I have a GTX280 and an nvidia 790i mobo, I have to have my raptor upside down in the bottom slot for the top HDD cage, I just got a second raptor and I cant use it due to the video card bing in the way, if it was an inch shorter or if the bay was an inch farther forward then it would be fine.
I did, the drives got to hot to touch, also for some reason I cant monitor SMART features for temps so I don't want to mess with doing the drives down there again till I get my 120x20mm fan I just ordered.
Mine stays within 28~35 depending on season, and that's with fan filters. Else I would have did away with the S-Flex but at 500rpm it's not perceivable.
I've had my P183 i7 system running for almost a week now and I'm not happy with its noise levels. At first I thought it was only slightly louder than my old Sonata 1 system, but I noticed that I can go into the next room and still hear it quite easily due to the tone. Then a weird little "ticky" sound cropped up, I discovered loosening the screws a bit on the top fan vent made it stop. And just then I discovered a fair amount of the annoying tone was due to vibrations, that if I place some weight on the top of the case, goes away. I have a 360 pad sitting on top of it for now. The tone of the noise still changes frequently which makes it irritating.
On the positive side, temps are very low, so I put the low noise adapters on my Noctua U12P fans a couple days ago, and they're still low enough that I'll put the "ultra" low noise adapters on them soon to see if it helps at all. Case fans have stayed on low. Also I tried covering the front holes but noticed no change in noise levels at all.
Samsung F1 (nice and quiet, but also got 3 older HDs from my Sonata 1 in there right now which aren't helping)
Thats not good. Do you think its the harddrives or just the sum of it all? I was thinking about getting a P183 and putting in some foam, didnt think I needed to add any mass-dampening tho. Was hoping I wouldn't have to add that much weight.
I had the same problem with my P182. Antec Tricool fans are crap. The top one on my P182 made the case hum. Replace it with a proper fan and the problem will go away.
well I got the 120mm x 20mm fan, but what fans would you all suggest for the other 3 spots to replace the crappy tri-cool fans? I don't mind too much noise but I want more air movement... I live in So Cali and we are getting in to the summer months.
Soft-mount them all with rubber fan mounts (Nexus include these with their fans, you will have to buy separately for Scythe fans). Use some Zalman Fanmates, a proper fan controller or some hard-wired voltage outputs (eg Zalman make some for 5V) to set the speeds for these fans - you can turn them up in summer or when you are gaming.
There is one difference between the P182 and P183 that might be to the P183's advantage: it's shorter. According to Antec's site, the P183 is 20.25" tall, whereas the P182 is 21.3". It doesn't sound like much (1.05"), but the space where I put my computer is 21.0" high. So, the P182 is just a smidge too big, while the P183 would just squeak in. Of course, if I were to use the top fan, that amount of clearance is still probably not enough to avoid turbulence/backwash/cavitation or some other technical term.
... but the metric values are exactly the same! The difference is that P182 is described using one decimal inch values and whole cms, whereas P183 is described with two decimal inch values and mms.

Chinese Smuggler Tried to Sneak Carbon Fiber for Fighter Jets, Feds Claim | CSC Center for Strategic Communication
Exporting aerospace-grade carbon fiber isn’t easy, as it can be used to build military planes like the F-22 Raptor. Photo: Air Force
The U.S. has busted up a plot to smuggle tons of carbon fiber to China, where the material would ostensibly be used in the construction of new fighter planes. That might seem worrying, but if the allegations are true, it’s probably a comforting sign. That’s because if Beijing needs to illegally import the ultra-tough polymers from America, that means we don’t have to worry too much about China’s upgraded air force.
The case involves a 40-year-old Chinese man named Ming Suan Zhang. On Wednesday, Zhang was charged in federal court in the Eastern District of New York with “attempting to illegally export aerospace-grade carbon fiber” from the U.S. to China, according to the criminal complaint and affidavit (.pdf) unsealed in court this week. Zhang pleaded not guilty, according a report by The New York Times, and his lawyer said Zhang was a sports equipment manufacturer who believed he was “caught in something he didn’t fully understand but he believed to be legal.”
But federal prosecutors allege Zhang was the mastermind behind the plot to illegally export $4 million worth of the military-grade material. Prosecutors also allege Zhang told undercover agents the material would be used for an upcoming Oct. 5 test flight of a “new Chinese fighter jet.” If convicted, Zhang faces up to 20 years in prison.
Aerospace-grade carbon fiber isn’t just simple plastic. It’s a specialized — and expensive — polymer used in nuclear plants and to build the fuselages of military aircraft like the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. $4 million would buy about two tons’ worth of M60JB carbon fiber, the type prosecutors allege Zhang sought to acquire. And as Zhang is likely now well aware, the U.S. government is not pleased when people attempt to export the material without a license.
But the case doesn’t just involve Zhang. According to the complaint, the plot began on April 25 when two of Zhang’s unnamed accomplices — who have not been charged with a crime and are listed in the criminal complaint as only “John Doe” and “Jane Doe” — contacted from Taiwan a representative of a company they believed dealt with “commodities with aerospace and military applications.” In reality, the company was a front business controlled by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the investigatory arm of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. The company representative wasn’t a commodities trader, either, but an undercover agent.
During an April teleconference, the buyers told the agent they wanted to ship “multiple tons of carbon fiber” from the U.S. to China through a third country in order to skip having to acquire an export license, and that acquiring the carbon fiber was “problematic” because it was related to a “military matter.” When the offer to use a middleman was rebuffed, the buyers asked if the carbon fiber could be mislabeled as something else, thereby sneaking past federal authorities. The agent told the buyers that what they were doing was quite illegal.
But shortly thereafter, the undercover agent decided to play along. On May 8, John and Jane Doe wired $1,000 to a bank account provided by the agent, and traveled to the U.S. in July to meet with the agent at a hotel room, where they were provided with a sample of M60JB.
Later that month, on July 17, the two buyers received an email from a Chinese email account about the carbon fiber. The email’s author “stated that he found an end user for the carbon fiber, and that it was needed for a test flight of a new Chinese fighter jet.”
The complaint doesn’t state whether the author was Zhang. But the next day, Zhang and John Doe spoke over the phone and talked about difficulties getting carbon fiber from Japan, and Doe mentioned he found a new seller in America. A second undercover agent then contacted Zhang, who told the agent the carbon fiber was for a “fighter plane,” and arranged to travel to the U.S. earlier in September, where he was arrested.
Now let’s assume all of this is true — that Zhang did attempt to buy polymers headed into China’s defense and aerospace industry. If so, it doesn’t reflect well on Beijing’s air force.
U.S. defense officials worry about China’s stealth fighters like the J-20 or the recently unveiled J-21. But if China has trouble even acquiring the polymers to build fighter jet fuselages — let alone the sophisticated electronic gear needed for a fully modern fighter – then they probably don’t need to worry that much. It’s pretty difficult to manufacture the jets without the basic, necessary plastics.
If China is resorting to smuggling the stuff, then it’s going to be a long, long time before its airpower can challenge America’s.
The property dispute was presided over by civil trial judge Li Zhiqing. The court adjusted the time for the hearing so as to facilitate both parties’ participation in the litigation and reduce their inconveniences.
The pillar industries in Longhua are traditional labor-intensive industries, and the district has a large number of migrant workers who usually work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. However, their working hours coincide with the office hours of the court.
In order to enable more convenient and efficient litigation services, the Longhua court launched a series of nighttime services, such as night court and nighttime mediation, to help settle disputes.

Missions are carried out at the request of countries or groups of countries to identify, evaluate and describe their specific technical assistance needs and provide policy advice on the problems they are faced with. These missions are usually fielded for a short duration and result in further project proposals for funding and, in some cases, in direct UNWTO recommendations to Members which they can implement themselves.
Projects are usually of long duration and aim to assist Governments in acquiring technical know-how in formulation of tourism policies and strategies in planning, product development, marketing and human resource development.
The projects are based on a policy of sustainability and focus on tourism master planning at all levels, establishment of tourism training institutes, formulation and regulations, preparation of marketing programmes, and national capacity building.

Editor’s note: This is part of a series of posts commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington by highlighting the women who were leaders in the Civil Rights movement but were only invited to have minimal roles in the March.
Black women were leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, but they were not invited speakers at the 1963 March on Washington. The fact that they were present on the podium, and one woman was asked to deliver brief remarks, can be attributed to Anna Arnold Hedgeman.
The name most often associated with the March on Washington is that of Martin Luther King, Jr., but without Hedgeman it is possible the final event that developed would not have materialized.
Hedgeman had directed a campaign for Civil Rights leader A. Philip Randolph, and was aware of his intentions to organize a “March on Washington for Jobs” in October of 1963 as part of his work with the Negro American Labor Council.
Around the same time, there was a press announcement that Martin Luther King was planning a March on Washington in July to demand a civil rights bill be passed. Some activists were concerned that Randolph and King’s plans would compete, or draw resources from one another.
Hedgeman proposed the two men meet. The result was a broader coalition and the planning of a unified March in August with a slogan of “For Jobs and Freedom.” This change led to greater external support, notably from the Southern Christian Leadership Council, the Congress on Racial Equality, and the NAACP.
Hedgeman was the sole woman invited to be on the Administrative Committee of the March on Washington that organized the March, alongside the “Big Six:” James Farmer, Martin Luther King, John Lewis, A. Philip Randolph, Roy Wilkins and Whitney Young. Hedgeman vocally opposed the absence of women on the committee, and advocated for women to be included. She suggested the Committee add leaders from organizations such as the National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs and the National Council of Negro Women.
She writes about the result of her proposal in her 1964 autobiography A Trumpet Sounds: A memoir of Negro leadership: “As usual, the men must have discussed the matter in my absence and when the first leaflet was printed, I was embarrassed to find that I was still the only woman listed.”
A week before the March, Hedgeman saw upon reviewing the final program that no women had been selected to speak; rather “it was proposed that Mr. Randolph, as chairman, would ask several Negro women to stand while he reviewed the historic role of Negro women, and that the women would merely take a bow at the end of his presentation.”
Hedgeman met to the discuss the absence of women in the March with Corinne Smith and Geri Stark, two women who had raised $14,000 for the March as part of the Negro American Labor Council. After hearing their shared concerns, she prepared a letter to Randolph that she read aloud at the final meeting of the Committee on August 16, 1963.
“In light of the role of the Negro women in the struggle for freedom and especially in light of the extra burden they have carried because of the castration of the Negro man in this culture, it is incredible that no woman should appear as a speaker at the historic March on Washington Meeting at the Lincoln Memorial.”
In the letter, she proposes that Randolph’s proposed remarks on women be delivered by a woman, suggesting Myrlie Evers and Diane Nash as possible speakers.
While no woman ended up giving a speech, her advocacy for women’s inclusion led to Daisy Bates being allowed to provide brief remarks, in which she gave awards to five other black women in the movement and made a pledge “to the women of America” to be active in fighting for civil rights and equality. It also resulted in Rosa Parks being presented onstage, “almost causually,” Hedgeman notes, and the inclusion of women on the dais.
Hedgeman reflects on that moment, writing, “We grinned: some of us, as we recognized anew that Negro women are second-class citizens.”
In her autobiography, Hedgeman explains her sentiments at the time: “The March on Washington created for the moment a sense of unity in the struggle of the Negro for freedom now. For me it was an experience which also highlighted the basic problems resulting from the wall of separation.” She goes on to discuss the visual impact of being at the Lincoln Memorial, celebrating the president who issued the Emancipation Proclamation, and the absence of any commemoration of Frederick Douglass for his role in emancipation. She writes:
“As I sat on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on the day of the March I thought of the 180,000 Negro soldiers and 29,000 black seamen who had moved in at the crucial moment to win the war and save ‘the fragile union.’ Most of the 250,000 people present could not know of these men, for the history books available to Americans have failed to record their story.”
Hedgeman’s involvement in the March on Washington was only part of a full life of civic engagement. She served as an aide to New York Mayor Robert F. Wagner from 1954-1958, the first black woman to serve on the state’s mayoral cabinet. She was one of the original 49 founders of the National Organization for Women.
She ran for a House seat in 1960, City Council of New York in 1965, and an assembly seat in the Democratic primary in 1968. All three bids were unsuccessful.
She worked with the YWCA for many years in a variety of roles, including Executive Director of the Philadelphia and Brooklyn branches. She was the Executive Director of the National Council for a Permanent Fair Employment Practices Committee, and the Assistant Dean of Women at Howard University. She was appointed to an administrative position in the Federal Security Agency under President Truman. The scope of her work far outstrips this short list of highlights.
“The problems of breaking the wall of separation are fantastic. They are part of every facet of American life and require that ‘we the people’ of these United States search for creative ways to meet them at every level of American society.”
Men’s Basketball team finishes 1-2 at the annual Columbus State Classic - Columbus State Community College
COLUMBUS – The Columbus State Men's Basketball Classic extended into a third day after two of the four participating teams faced a travel ban in the Buffalo area, causing a cancellation of a Friday game. The ban also resulted in the Cougars picking up an extra game, consequently, playing three games in three consecutive days.
The Cougars opened the tournament on Friday with a 93-72 victory over Macomb Community College (Warren, Michigan). Columbus State shot an efficient 50% from the field and 47% behind the arc. Five Cougars scored in the double digits in the win over the Monarchs.
Sophomore Bryan Porter playing only in the first half, scored 17 points, including a career-best five 3-pointers. Sophomore Matthew Rhodes had 14 points, four rebounds and six assists, freshmen Robert Caldwell scored 14, Jarel Woolridge had 11, and Travon Hester had 10 for the Cougars. Sophomore Khari Burton added seven assists and three steals to go with six points.
On Saturday, freshman Robert Caldwell had an outstanding offensive performance on the court with 31 points, shooting 9/17 in 3-pointers and 4/4 from the free throw line. Matthew Rhodes had 17 points, five rebounds, and three assists while sophomore Christopher Cook had ten points and nine rebounds.
The Cougars fell short against Niagara County Community College (Sanborn, New York) with a score of 90-76. Niagara had nearly twice as many turnovers with 16 compared to Columbus State's 9, but the Thunder Wolves shot better from the field with 54%, compared to the Cougars 35% and out-rebounded the Cougars 49-32.
By Sunday, fatigue set in as the Cougars were defeated by Genesee Community College (Batavia, New York) 101-68. The Cougars were out-rebounded 26-53 and shot only 35% from the field, compare to Genesee's 58%. Freshman Khylan Jackson led the team with 15 points and four rebounds while Bryan Porter and Robert Caldwell each added 11 points to the effort.
The record stands at 4-4 for the men's basketball team as they break for Thanksgiving. They resume play in the first weekend of December, heading up to Michigan to take on the 16th ranked Mott Community College and Delta Community College.

If a defendant's involuntary intoxicated issue causes a criminal act, the defendant won't be convicted if, because of the intoxication, he / she is unable to understand the criminality of the carry out.
Quite a few regulations are enforced by danger of criminal punishment, as well as variety of the punishment varies with the jurisdiction. The scope of criminal law is too wide to catalog intelligently. Nevertheless, the following are a few of the additional typical areas of criminal legislation. Things[edit]
" Congress then fails to provide plenty of federal funding to prosecute all The brand new laws, making a condition during which the initiatives of area legislation enforcement "are undermined with the unrealistic expectations established by Congress' nicely-publicized enactments."
You’ve noticed it time after time on primetime tv law enforcement shows—cops slapping the cuffs with a “perp” and examining him his legal rights: “You've the correct to remain silent. Anything at all you say can and
There are a selection of defenses available to a defendant within a criminal prosecution. The next record illustrates some typical defenses folks depend upon:
During the absence of this kind of a call, the Sixth Circuit said that Tennessee experienced violated Lanier's thanks approach proper being reasonably warned that particular perform is prohibited and carries with it the chance for criminal punishment.
This information treats the principles of criminal law. For treatment from the regulation of criminal course of action, see
This kind of purpose might be noticed inside the German criminal code of 1998, which admonished the courts the “consequences which the punishment will likely be envisioned to acquire to the perpetrator’s upcoming lifetime in Modern society shall be regarded as.” In America a Design Penal Code proposed from the American Regulation Institute in 1962 states that an aim of criminal legislation should be “to give good warning of the nature of your perform declared to represent an offense” and “to promote the correction and rehabilitation of offenders.” Due to the fact that point There was renewed fascination within the notion of normal avoidance, like both the deterrence of attainable offenders along with the stabilization and strengthening of social norms.
Criminal intent may also be presumed in the commission on the act. That is definitely, the prosecution may perhaps rely on the presumption that a person intends the Pure and Probable Repercussions of their voluntary acts. One example is, the intent to commit murder might be shown by The actual voluntary motion that triggered the Loss of life, including the pointing and capturing of a firearm.
Being a standard rule, an try and dedicate a criminal offense is often a misdemeanor, if the criminal offense alone is usually a felony or simply a misdemeanor. On the other hand, in a very case of violent crime, an endeavor can be categorized as being a felony. Attempted murder and tried rape are samples of felonious tries. In an try situation, the prosecution ought to verify the defendant specially intended to dedicate the attempted criminal offense that's been billed.
Italian and Austrian regulation treat all members in a criminal offense as principals in the primary diploma, except for add-ons following the actuality. The Model Penal Code and the law for most U.S. states take care of the steps of an accessory after the fact to be a separate statutory offense. In another 3 levels of participation, the accent is handled as a principal in the initial diploma.
Very little, a professor of law at the University of California, Hastings College of Law, defended the rise in federal crimes like a security in opposition to the inability of states to capture and prosecute all criminals. If the standard of justice is best within the federal courts, Small opines, "then difficulties of crime can't be ignored federally even though point out criminal justice techniques slowly get more info but surely sink and justice fails."

It is frequently thought, pondered, and questioned, but often this question is not directly asked. Recently a former member inquired:
We can start with the 7 basics that most fitness professionals, weight loss experts, and physical therapist agree with.
1.	The term heavy is subjective. For so many of us, our body weight is heavy enough until we can move through the entire range of motion for any prescribed movement pattern. (That is semi-fancy trainer talk for perform an exercise, like a squat, correctly and without a load)
2.	Adding a load and knowing when to increase it is confusing. Start small and increase minimally overtime. Increasing weights 2.5% each week or two can deliver amazing results overtime. The key is consistency. One heavy session is more likely to cause soreness, pain or injury as opposed to a progressive training program. Earning each pound added to any movement is required. Try adding load in small increments over the course of 4 weeks.
3.	Fear of bulking up is something women tend to worry about more often than men. Some trainers respond with a line about women not having enough testosterone to bulk up, but the problem with this statement is not that it is entirely untrue – which is is. The problem is that the statement doesn’t even address the concerns of the client! Some women do build muscle fast and feel like they are bulking up. Many factors can be considered in this situation. Consuming too many calories, lifting too heavy too soon, etc. Accepting myths about women that change your perception like the “long, lean Pilates look.” That’s not real! We can’t lengthen muscles! These muscles are as long as they are going to be for adults. What we can do is tone and strengthen and maybe most importantly improve your health and quality of life.
4.	Lifting as heavy as possible is not recommended every day. Discuss with your trainer how often you should lift heavy, max out, or PR (Personal Record). Muscles need recovery time to avoid injury. Limited recovery time is one of the most prominent issues we see. We are impressed by those who want to give 110% all the time. Inspiring? Of course. Smart? Maybe not always. Proper nutrition, sleep, stretching and foam rolling, and rest is the realm in which our bodies get stronger. Think about it. Lifting heavy causes fatigue and muscle soreness. We cannot, and should not, lift as heavy as possible again until we are fully recovered.
Program design plays a pivotal role in increasing muscle strength and endurance, changing the shape of our bodies, and fat loss. Ellipse Fitness provides many opportunities, on various days of the week, to lift heavy. When scheduling your sessions or selecting your weights on any given day, decide which day is best for you to lift heavy based on what physical activities you’ve planned for the rest of the week, whether you have time to eat a high quality meal near your workout, whether or not you expect to get a full night of sleep, etc. Discuss with your coach/trainer. Goal setting sessions are always available to our members.
Small group sessions allow our members to make strength training a priority. These sessions are available several days a week to ensure that we can get and stay strong. Custom programing is available for our members who have specific goals or limitations.
We will find many landmarks for activities such as these. It is important to train the body to maintain strength. Once we stop challenging ourselves or even just visiting our perceived limitations, we begin to lose strength and definition. Our work capacity lowers. Our ability to get up and down off the floor weakens. We lose strength. We fall. We break bones. We gain fat. We lose confidence.

Bone density is a measure of how strong and durable your bones are. Osteopenia is diagnosed when density levels drop, but aren’t quite low enough for an osteoporosis diagnosis. Bones naturally weaken with age as bone cells become reabsorbed into the body quicker than they are reproduced causing them to become weaker and more likely to break during normal everyday activity.
About HALF of Americans over the age of 50 get osteopenia! However, women tend to develop osteopenia/porosis much more often than men due to lower peak bone densities and the hormonal effects of menopause. Peak bone density occurs around the age of 30-35 and then begins to decline thereafter. So, young folks out there: try to do whatever you can to attain the highest possible bone density by age 30 to help prevent the natural decline as you age!
• GENETICS! Approximately 50-85% of bone mass density is genetic, so take heed if your mother or father suffered from osteoporosis.
Lifestyle changes can stop and/or reduce the progression of osteopenia/osteoporosis. Although some cases may require medication, there are many ways to stop or reduce the progression of bone density loss!
But unfortunately not just any exercise counts. Weight-bearing activity is critical, so things like swimming, cycling, etc while they have their own benefits with regards to osteoporosis resistance training is number 1.
Strength training helps prevent osteopenia/osteoporosis by adding stress to the bone causing it to grow stronger and denser – it is basically that simple. Ask your bones to handle higher load and they will respond by building themselves stronger!
Weight bearing is key, but jumping has higher force than jogging so jumping triggers more bone growth for instance, so plyometric movements are particularly effective for improving bone density!
*It’s important to note that for someone currently diagnosed with osteopenia or osteoporosis you should consult your physician before engaging in high intensity exercise given the risks*
About 50% of people worldwide are low in vitamin D due to a combination of living in places with very little sun in the winter along with concerns around skin cancer many have avoided any sun exposure without sunscreen. Merely 10 or 15 minutes a day is enough for significant vitamin D levels!
Every weekend we’ve been posting our Shake It Up recipes on Facebook. Each shake is jam pack with different ingredients that coordinate smoothly and nutritiously with our Ellipse Fitness Protein Powders. These recipes are fun because they’re not your average mixtures. Take the Peanut Butter and Jelly Shake for example. This might sound a bit off-putting, but don’t knock it until you’ve tried it! Here are a few of our favorites that we’ve shared with you. Keep your eyes peeled for new recipes each weekend on our Facebook page!
To do anything well, you have to be a bit critical, but you also have to be compassionate toward yourself.
How do you typically react to yourself making a mistake in life? What type of language do you use with yourself when you don’t follow your healthy eating plan or don’t exercise as much as you planned? Do you insult yourself or take a more kind and understanding tone? What are the consequences of being so hard on yourself? Does it make you more motivated and happy or discouraged and depressed?
I think we can all benefit by learning to be more self-compassionate and now is the perfect time to start.
We’ve all got preconceived notions and ideas about “what works”. We may accidentally fall into old habits, even though we’ve learned new information. For example, I started running again. I thought it may help decrease the time it took for me to lose the weight I’ve put on in the past 6 months of stress. Hmmm….think, Lisa. What do you to preach to members? You can’t do enough cardio or run long enough to escape your food and diet choices. Weight training will change the shape of your body—lifting heavy and pushing limits is the BEST and FASTEST way to results.
Dear Lisa…TAKE YOUR OWN ADVICE. So—hello AMP’D, oh how I’ve missed you! WEIGHT TRAINING! FUNCTIONAL (yet challenging) movement! I’ve seen change already and AMP’D started exactly 2 weeks ago. SO….should I beat myself up for focusing on my challenges in the last 6 months that kept me away from AMP’D? Should I dwell and blame others for my lack of self control when asked to join them for a bottle of wine? Nope…I take full responsibility for my choices…THEN AND NOW! So…taking the advice I would share with everyone willing to listen…CHALLENGE YOURSELF when it comes to strength and resistance! PUSH YOUR LIMITS in all cardio and strength workouts and take responsibility for your life. Start now. Start fast and don’t stop…be compassionate in your failures, but take the turn toward the positive.
Just like my first marathon that took me more than 5 hours to complete, I didn’t reach my goal because I didn’t really want to reach it.
I ran the Go! In 4:36:33. It’s a huge improvement. I gave it all I had to give and could not have improved on that time, on that day, on that course. I did find time to facebook and twitter my thoughts during the course. I stopped to talk to someone I hadn’t seen in a long time. I searched my IPOD for my favorite songs. I adjusted my ponytail so many times that I broke it and had to run with my hair down. I forgot my inserts for my shoes. All excuses. Want to know the real reason it took me 4:36:33?
I enjoyed it! It was a brutal course. Make no mistake that it did kick my behind, but I loved the time to think. I savored the time I was able to run with friends. I made the most of the time I spent running alone. The text messages I received along the way from my very dearest of friends lifted me up to a level of happiness I have never experienced before. I was running on air. I didn’t want it to ever be over. (My thighs did. They are reading this post under protest.) There were friends behind me if I fell back, at the finish line to greet me, and precious angels on the sidelines and on my phone! Coach, I’d like to thank you especially for your comment when I thought I was hitting the “wall.”
Once I saw the flag at Union Station, I knew I was all but done. I started walking. I knew I didn’t make my goal time. It was all but over. I was sad. I was defeated. Then I heard the most beautiful voice yelling “Go Ann.” Screaming at me to go! It was one of my original running partners, an Ellipse instructor (that explains the screaming), and a savior. I was so tired, but after a big hug I sprinted to the end. I felt like a winner. I’ve never felt that way before. I’d never felt so strong. Incredibly, it wasn’t my strength that made me feel strong. It was yours!

It’s that time of year once again where the leaves are transforming into beautiful shades of auburn, the air is becoming crisp and the sky is ready to be filled with an explosion of light, colours and sparkle. Unsure of what to do this bonfire night? Not to worry, we’ve got you covered.
After years of fabulous displays in Sefton park and Newsham Park, there will be no official displays in either of these venues this year. Instead, the Fireworks on the Mersey are back! Beginning at 4pm, there will be plenty of entertainment before what promises to be an incredible finale; there will be street performers entertaining on the Albert Docks, Salthouse Quay, Mann Island, Princes Parade and – on the Wirral side of the river – Hamilton Square and Woodside Ferry Terminal.
As well as all that, at 5.30pm, world renowned Drummers Les Commandos Percu and Deabru Beltza will be performing, making their way through the city centre and finishing at the water front just before the fireworks are due to begin.
It is certainly an event that cannot be missed, so be sure to wrap up in your favourite scarf to shield yourself from the sea breeze and get down to the riverside early to get your places and soak up the atmosphere.
If the Fireworks weren’t enough and a night out is on the cards, great news: Sanity events are back! A spectacular line-up, including Sem Vox, DLDK, DJ Jacob Plant, Gerald Le Funk, Sonny Banks, Kayo D-Generation. Plus, with the very big special guest – Yves V – your bonfire night is sure to go off with a bang! Ticket prices are £20 and available on Skiddle.
If you fancy enjoying bonfire night away from the crowds of the city, St Helens ‘Spark in the Park’ bonfire may just be the event for you. As well as a bonfire, there will be a child’s firework display at 7pm and a main display at 8pm.
Liverpool promises to deliver a brilliant bonfire night, so get your thermals at the ready and indulge yourself in the nights traditions of sweet treats that may make you loose a filling or two, hot stews, sparklers and of course a gigantic firework display. The water front is expected to be extremely busy, so we recommend planning ahead and getting down early to avoid disappointment!

President Donald Trump condemned anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial at a ceremony inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on Tuesday. April 25, 2017. (Photo: WH.gov screengrab)
“Those who deny the Holocaust are an accomplice to this horrible evil, and we will never be silent. We just won’t. We will never ever be silent in the face of evil again,” Trump said at a ceremony inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on Tuesday.
The event was sponsored by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in honor of the 8-day National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance, which was officiated by the U.S. Congress in 1979.
Included among the hundreds in attendance were several Holocaust survivors and concentration camp liberators.
A U.S. Army band played music commemorating units that had participated in the liberation while an honor guard marched through the Rotunda.
The Trump campaign was accused of subtle anti-Semitism due to it’s indirect associations with members of the alt-right and those allegations have followed the new administration into the White House.
Jewish groups strongly condemned the appointment of White House Chief Strategist and former Breitbart executive chair Steven K. Bannon.
Bannon was accused by his ex-wife during divorce proceedings of having made anti-Semitic comments in reference to the demographics of the school which his daughters had attended.
The Trump Administration in late January came under fire for having issued a statement in honor of the 72nd anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp in which an estimated 1.1 million Jews were murdered-that did not specifically mention Jews as victims of Nazi persecution.
More recently the Administration came under fire following White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s verbal gaffe in which he incorrectly stated that unlike Syrian dictator Bashar-al-Assad, the Nazis did not use poison gas to kill their victims.
Trump’s son-in-law and close confidant Jared Kushner is Jewish and was in attendance at the ceremony on Tuesday seated next to Vice President Mike Pence.
Trump’s eldest daughter Ivanka converted to Judaism around the time she married Kushner in 2009 and their three children are reportedly being raised Jewish.
Candidate Trump garnered 25 percent of the Jewish vote in last year’s election. That number is slightly higher than GOP Sen. John McCain’s 21 percent in 2008 but still less than Mitt Romney’s 30 percent in 2012.
“We will confront anti-Semitism. We will stamp out prejudice. We will condemn hatred. We will bear witness and we will act,” the President said.

me likes this. most of my proofs would come from the field of psychometrics or quantitative psychology though (mostly factor analysis and stuctural equation modelling).
here i'm doing the (rather simple) proof of how the linear factor analysis model can be parameterised as a covariance structure model. it's relevant because as a linear factor model it is unsolvable, but as a covariance structure model it is possible to obtain parameter estimates.
let the obseverd score \(x\) be defined as the linear factor model \(x = \Lambda F+\epsilon_{i}\) since it is known that (in the case of multivariate normality) \(E(xx')=\Sigma\) it trivially follows that:
which happens because the erros are random and assumed uncorrelated with the Factors and estimated loadings. Now by linearity of expectation and substituting the covariance matrix of the Factors and of the errors we can see that:
Okay, since this day is soon over (at least according to Swedish time) and no one posted a proof yet today, I'll post another proof. I'll give a very simple, and possibly boring, proof this time. I'll prove that \(\bar{x}\) is the value that minimizes the sum \(\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i-a)^2}\) (1).
By taking the first derivative with respect to a and setting it equal to zero, we get \(\sum_{i=1}^n{-2(x_i-a)}=0 \Leftrightarrow -2\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}+2na=0 \Leftrightarrow \sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}=na \Leftrightarrow \bar{x}=a\).
\(\sum (x_i - a)^2 = \sum (x_i - \bar{x} + \bar{x} - a)^2 = \sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 + (\bar{x} - a)^2 + 2(x_i - \bar{x})(\bar{x} - a)\)
The first summation we can't control and the second sum is always non-negative so the minimum would occur if we can make it equal to 0 - which happens when \(a=\bar{x}\).
Now clearly I need a few more details to make it more rigorous but I like that version a little bit more because it also gives hints at what we do in ANOVA when decomposing the sums of squares.
a while ago (before Englund became an MVC) I posted a proof about another result in factor analysis. I thought it would be nice to resurrect it (briefly) and add it here to our small (but growing) compendium of proofs. the original thread is here
Let \(\bf{S}\) be a covariance matrix with eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs (\(\lambda_1, \mathbf{e}_1\)), (\(\lambda_2, \mathbf{e}_2\)), ..., (\(\lambda_p, \mathbf{e}_p\)), where
I posted a proof about another result in factor analysis. I thought it would be nice to resurrect it (briefly) and add it here to our small (but growing) compendium of proofs.
Very nice. If you keep posting stuff on FA I'll be forced to get more familiar with it, which is good
i don't quite understand why but pretty much NO ONE in the Statistics world even touches on Factor Analysis. when it comes to dimension reduction techniques almost all of the undergrad stats textbooks i've seen that deal with intro to multivariate analysis stop at principal components. there may be like some small subsection in some namless appendix that says something about Factor Analysis... but that's it!
Here's a link to geometrically based proof I posted a few months ago in another thread. It is about constraints among sets of correlation coefficients.
In the thread I just call this an "argument" but if Dason's thing counts as a proof then I think mine does too
Nice thread so I make my debut here: The derivation of the Ridge-Estimator in the linear Regression Model.
-\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{y} + \mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} + \lambda \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = \mathbf{0}
det(\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X}+ \lambda \mathbf{I}_k) \geq det(\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X})+det(\lambda\mathbf{I}_k) = det(\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X}) + \lambda^n >0
Also this is the unique global minimizer of \( Q_n \) due to the fact that the problem under consideration is just a sum auf convex functions and \( \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} \) is the only local minimizer, so one doesn't need to check the second order conditon and the associated hessians.
*One can find a good proof for that inequality in Magnus, J.R. & Neudecker, H. (1999). Matrix Differential Calculus. Wiley and Sons on page 227 theorem 28.
\( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty }y^{n-1}\left ( \cos nx+i\sin nx \right )=\frac{\cos x+i\sin x}{1-y\cos x-yi\sin x} \)
Subsequently letting \( x\rightarrow 1 \), then it follows that if \( x \) is neither \( 0 \) nor a multiple of \( 2\pi \) we have
Setting \( x=\frac{\pi }{3}r_{s} \) and exponentiating \( e^{-1} \) gives the relationship (for large sample sizes) between the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients as:

Steve Wero was executed by policemen outside Mowlem police station in Nairobi’s Dandora Estate on October 16th this year.
According to his father James Ngare, his 20 year old son had been arrested at Dandora cinema a day before. His mistake was operating a boda boda without a license and a reflector jacket.
He was locked up at the station until the following day at about 9am when he was picked by three armed officers and bundled in a white probox car.
“Wero was hiring the motorcycle and was remitting Sh500 per day to the owner. He completed his form four in 2016 and he has tried to look for a job in vain,” Ngare, a metal dealer, said.
But Wero is not the only person who has mysteriously died in the hands of rogue police men who are killing Kenyans with impunity.
The police have killed 24 people in the past three weeks in Dandora, Kayole, Mathare and Majengo, local based human rights organisations have said.
They include six in Dandora; two in Mowlem; 10 in Mathare North; four in Majengo; and two in Kayole.
Amid sobs and tears, Bena Buluma narrated how his two sons – Victor and Bernard – were killed in cold blood by police officers as they were returning home from work on August 9, last year.
Victor, 22, was shot on back and Bernard, 27, on the head and died instantly at about 2.30pm on Stage Number 10 in Mathare. “I now have two orphans that I have to take care of and I don’t have a job. My children were killed and I can say before God that they were not thieves,” she said.
Agony written all over her face, Buluma lamented about the arbitrary killing saying that the police should arrest and charge the suspected youths instead.
“No mothers gives birth to child to become a thief or go to the university. We are left with burden and we are suffering. Let them arrest and jail them. It is painful,” she said.
Social Justice Centre and Police Reform Working Group raised a red flag over the rising cases of extrajudicial executions in informal settlements and called on the government to act swiftly and stop the killings.
“We wish to express concern over the increasing incidences of death from police use of lethal force. Over the past one month, incidences of torture and extrajudicial executions implicating police officers have sharply risen,” Mathare Social Justice coordinator Gacheke Gachihi said.
The organisations have been documenting extrajudicial killings in the informal settlements and forwarding the cases to Independent Policing Oversight Authority for investigations and prosecution of the officers implicated in the killings.
Gachihi, who read a joint statement during a press briefing at the Dandora Community Justice Centre yesterday, said the dreaded officers have been carrying out the executions in open places and in broad daylight . Some of them (police) are well-known to the residents.
The High Court has nullify the Nairobi Hospital Management Board decision to suspend top surgeon Stanley Ominde Khanga.
Justice Bryan Ongaya of the Employment and Labour Relations Court suspended the decision by the board until the hearing and determination of a petition lodged against it.
“Pending the hearing of the petitioner’s application there shall be a stay of implementation of the decision suspending the applicant’s admitting rights” he ruled.
Khanga had applied to the hospital to use its facilities as a consultant plastic and constructive surgeon on August 7, 2006 and the request was approved.
The applicant through lawyer Kiama Wangai, told the court that on June 6, 2018 a patient by the name June Wanza Malupi was referred by the doctor from his medical facility to the hospital to undergo breast augmentation and liposuction.
Following the operation, the patient passed away and the hospital blamed the surgeon and suspended his admitting rights.
Wangai said that by the time the suspending orders were issued, no investigation had been carried out.
Khanga was aggrieved by the decision and urged the court to lift two suspension letters issued by the hospital management.
He pointed out that the suspensions were against the rules of natural justice meant to deny the petitioner’s right to earn a living.
“The reason for suspension of admitting rights have no connection to employment contract with the petitioner and hospital management,” the lawyer argues.
SPRINGFIELD -- More dentists may be requiring upfront payment from patients in response to a new dental plan for state of Illinois employees, retirees and dependents, but few patients are complaining.
The new contract with Delta Dental of Illinois, which began July 1, will pay the not-for-profit group $12.3 million over the five-year contract to process between $110 million and $115 million a year in dental claims for about 350,000 people statewide.
The agreement is expected to save the state $8 million to $10 million annually in claims through the use of managed-care networks that weren’t part of the previous contract with CompBenefits, according to Januari Smith, spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services.
The savings would be generated by payment discounts of 15 percent to 30 percent that dentists must accept if they want to be in one of the networks, said Greg Johnson, executive director of the Illinois State Dental Society.
The state’s basic dental benefit isn’t changing. But Delta Dental chief executive Bernie Glossy said the new networks can be attractive to patients because the plans will result in fewer out-of-pocket costs, and the reduced fees allow patients to stretch their maximum $2,500 annual benefit for all dental services.
Under the old system, dentists billed the state for their services and were free to bill above what the state would pay. Dentists could bill the patient upfront or wait for payment, and reimbursement checks from the state would go directly to dentists.
Under the new system, dentists who belong to one of the managed-care networks — either Delta Dental PPO or Delta Dental Premier — must accept what the state pays and not bill patients extra. They continue to receive reimbursement checks.
However, dentists not in the networks don’t receive reimbursements directly — their patients receive the checks. This is the way Naperville-based Delta also handles reimbursement for non-network dentists in other employers’ plans, Glossy said.
He said he doesn’t know whether more dentists will demand upfront payment as a result of the new setup. He said Delta Dental has received few, if any, complaints from patients.
Springfield dentist Brandon Maddox said he decided not to join one of the Delta networks because of the size of the discounts required. He said his office, like most dental offices, spends 60 percent to 70 percent of its revenues on overhead.
Maddox requires patients in the state plan to pay 100 percent of their bills upfront or get a loan to do so. However, he said he gives patients a 5 percent discount if they pay the entire bill on the spot.
“We’re making it work for my patients,” Maddox said. “I don’t want to strain my patients’ pocketbooks any more than I have to.”
Maddox, who said at least half of his patients are covered by the state’s plan, believes that most other Springfield dentists not in the Delta networks also are requiring upfront arrangements.
Most patients have been understanding, he said, and many are upset with the state’s long delays in payments to dentists.
“From a standpoint of a business person, the way the state is functioning is unacceptable,” Maddox said. “The state employees are the ones who suffer.”
Maddox estimated the state’s payment delays average more than seven months, a factor in his decision to require upfront arrangements.
Delta Dental contends that 75 percent of the state’s dentists are members of one of Delta’s networks. Johnson, however, believes that perhaps half of Illinois dentists, and less than half of Springfield dentists, are in the networks.
Hank Scheff, director of employee benefits for Chicago-based Council 31 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said he has heard few complaints from state employees about the new dental contract.
He said he doesn’t believe the practice of non-network dentists requiring payment upfront is any more widespread than under the former dental plan, but he doesn’t know for sure.
Scheff said dentists don’t have any more reason to request upfront payments now, as long as they trust their patients to pay their bills.

Namely the giving of sexual pleasure to the partner with oral caresses of his genitals. Oral sex is not in vain called one of the most intimate of caresses.

"Over the last month we had receipts of $1,103, $750 of that was from the fall fundraiser. We also received $258 from the Green Party US. Our expenses were $395.
"We have been negotiating with the mailing company used for our recent fundraising mailing. It looks like we owe them an additional $452. Including the $448 we already paid that makes for a total of $900.

Bob also spoke of his efforts to determine what fundraising methods are acceptable for the CTGP in light of Connecticut's laws relating to political parties.
**Northeast: planning to (re-)start TV show; Green appointed to housing commission; chapter may form town committee; city council member Juan Perez changed voter registration from Green Party to Working Families Party.
**Hartford: needs donation of television to continue having movie nights; planning fundraiser with Nader and rock artist Patti Smith at end of January; chapter may be forming in New Britain.
**Tolland: has worked against a WalMart (construction delayed); new WalMart proposed for Stafford Springs; Manchester/Manchester Community College chapter may form.
2. Executive Committee. Mike listed some of the topics discussed at the December Executive Committee meeting: the December fundraising letter, unreimbursed expenditures of Chris Reilly, an audit of CTGP financial records by Audrey Cole, a possible "thank you candidates/elections discussion" event, internal elections, and the Proposal for the Project for a Green American Connecticut (Nicholson/Ferrucci).
The Executive Committee endorsed a letter to several senators which says that "the November 2, 2004 presidential election was fraught with voting violations, misconduct of some highly placed election officials, tampering ...." It asks that these senators refuse to certify the results of the election in Congress on January 6 and support any House members who challenge the results. The letter and additional information was published on the News listserve on January 4.
3. VOTER. Mike reported on a 1/4/05 VOTER meeting attended by 25 people. They hope to meet with the Secretary of State and the governor. Projects include voting machines (including inclusion of a paper trail) and legislation on ballot access for minor parties. There will be a venders' meeting in connection with a request for proposals for voting machines January 11 at the Transportation Department, and VOTER hopes to be able to present its views there.
4. Report from US Green Party representatives. Tim reported that the national Green Party has laid off their fundraiser, due to financial difficulties.
5. Elections committee. Elizabeth noted that Ralph Ferrucci has agreed to chair this committee. She noted that the committee has a listserve.
6. Internal elections committee. Jean said that the annual meeting is planned for mid-March (last year it was March 13). A mailing is planned to people entitled to vote in the internal elections. Last year a full ballot package (ballot, voting instructions, candidate biographies, and information about the annual meeting) was sent out to all eligible. This year the poor financial status of the CTGP may lead to use of postcards instead.
Jean said that she likes the idea of sending the full ballot package to all who voted in last year's internal elections, despite the cost. No one objected to this idea. The full ballot package could also be sent out to people who have registered as Greens since last March--people that hadn't ever received the full package before.
Are postcards really cheaper than the full package? Aaron said that the postage for a postcard is 19 cents. Elizabeth said that you can send a pdf file to the post office and it will print and mail postcards. Mike said he and the Hartford chapter favor sending the full package to all; people receiving a postcard are much less likely to vote than those receiving a ballot; fundraising should be done to cover the costs. Aaron suggested printing the ballot on postcards that opened up to a full sheet of paper. Aaron said he could do layout work for the mailing.
David has investigated two possible locations for the annual meeting in New Haven. Vic said he will inquire at Wesleyan. Jean said that a separate room for counting ballots is needed. Bill Davis (a Green running for Congress in 2005) was mentioned as one possible speaker for the annual meeting.
1. Bylaws segment "4-1 Chapters" (Appendix 1). Referred to chapters by September SCC meeting (a step in the bylaws revision process).
Ed and Andy reminded us that the BRPP committee was to do further work on these bylaws proposals, including citing the paragraphs in the current bylaws that these proposals would supplement or replace. This work has not been done, so these proposals were not considered further tonight.
3. Proposal to become an organizational supporter of abolishing the death penalty in Connecticut (Appendix 3). By consensus the SCC passed this proposal. David will notify the Connecticut Network to Abolish the Death Penalty of our support.
1. Planning/strategizing session for the state party in January. (Agenda item from Tom Sevigny, Andy Derr, Lindsay Mathews, Bob Eaton, Colin Bennett, and Kaye Ward.) Tim will work on arranging a combination "thank you candidates" session (at which our November 2004 candidates can say what worked for them) and planning session. The planning session could include a presentation by Calvin Nicholson and Ralph Ferrucci (Proposal for the Project for a Green American Connecticut). We agreed on Saturday January 22, 11am-2pm at the Hartford office. Tim will publish details to listserves; he asks that chapter members be informed of the event.
**Mike said that a New Britain state representative will be submitting a single payer health insurance bill to the Connecticut legislature this session. There will be a meeting of the Healthcare for All Coalition on January 20--Mike will post the details to listserves.
**Jean said that there will be a bus leaving Willimantic for the presidential inauguration protests in Washington DC. Elizabeth said that there will be three buses from Connecticut.
**There are daily vigils in front of the governor's office (until the execution of Michael Ross) sponsored by the Connecticut Network to Abolish the Death Penalty. There will be a lobby day January 19 at the Capitol on the death penalty issue.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: On January 26, 2005, CT plans to execute serial murderer Michael Ross. This will be the first execution in CT and all of New England since 1960.
Of the six New England states, only Connecticut and New Hampshire have the death penalty. New Hampshire has nobody on death row and has not executed anyone since 1939. Rhode Island has not put anyone to death since 1845; in Maine it's been since 1885; in Massachusetts, 1947; and Vermont, 1954. Michael Ross is one of 8 or 9 men on CT's death row.
The CT Network to Abolish the Death Penalty (CNADP) is seeking organizational partners. The New Haven Green Party and the Fairfield County Green Party have already signed on. This requires no financial support, but the affirmation of a resolution stating several "WHEREAS" clauses (arguments against the death penalty) followed by:
"THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that our organization calls upon the Connecticut General Assembly to abolish the death penalty."

These 3 cosmetic packs are the sole items that players will be in a position to purchase during the Xbox One Game Preview, and players will have lots of choices to select from when it concerns the packs.

The PC community has grown a good deal in a really limited time frame and there isnt any reason to believe the game wont be equally as addicting for Xbox players. The site states its something PUBG Corp wants to add down the road, perhaps as soon as the game is finished, as shown by a Microsoft representative.

Bring on such a desert map! We guess because its about becoming the lone survivor, even if theres a lot of teamwork on the way.
The game will probably remain in early access for some moment. It continues to attract new players that are hoping to get that sweet, sweet chicken dinner. This usually means youre have to begin downloading the game at midnight, and after that begin playing once PUBG is installed. There isnt just one play through of Black Desert that ends up the same because its up to the player to determine the method by which they level. Because of this, players will need to use the Xbox Game Preview program to be able to play the game. Xbox One players might have to wait somewhat longer for the full-release edition.

The movie ‘Dabaang’ in Hindi has been released in Tamil as ‘Osthe’. In place of Salman who starred the Hindi version, Simbu is cast in ‘Osthe’. Gilli Dharani has directed this movie. Number of cine stars as Santhanam, Jithan Ramesh, Nazer, Revathi, Saranya Mohan, Nizhalgal Ravi, Vijayakumar, Ganesh, Thambi Ramaiah, Vaiyapuri, and Mayilsaami have acted in this movie.
Although Simbu has imitated Salman in the police getup, his character of course attracts the fans. He has really given tantalizing performance with others as Santhanam, Thambi Ramaiah, Vaiyapuri, and Mayilsami. The punch dialogues are of course to be enjoyed. Richa Gangopadhyay is the film’s lead actress and has paired up with Simbu.

I was moving a concrete splash pad. Not far, xusto 18 inches. I tried to lift and slide it… not good. I stood it up on its end and walked it – perfect. Later that night, I got up out of the recliner to go to bed. My lower back felt “funny” and a little stiff or tight.
I awoke the next morning with sharp pain running down my right leg. On the 10 escala, I rated it a 5. Kim set an appointment with a Chiropractor for the next morning. By the time I got home from work, my pain level was at a 10. I had never felt such pain. I took pain meds and went to bed.
Nas primeiras horas da mañá, I partially awoke but still dreaming. It seemed like my legs were going numb. I feel back asleep. In the morning, I awoke to find that I had no feeling below my waist. Knowing something was very wrong with me, mantivemos o compromiso inicial co Quiroprácticos, with me in a wheelchair. She suspected Cauda Equina Syndrome and recommended I go directly to an Emergency Room. I did.
My Doctor got the results on Tuesday the 19th and referred me immediately to a neurosurgeon. I saw him 2 days later. He wanted me in the hospital now for surgery the next day to decompress the spine.
Problem – I was on a blood thinner and they couldn’t operate then. I stopped the med and went into the hospital on Sunday, coa cirurxía o día seguinte, 25.
The surgeon performed a L4/L5 microdiscectomy to remove parts of a ruptured disk in order to relieve the pressure on my spinal nerve bundle. The disk had ruptured directly into the canal and had crushed the nerves controlling the lower ½ of my body.
Physically – After Rehab came Physical Therapy. Some normal feeling returned to parts of my thighs. The rest stayed numb or got tingly painful. Now, 10 meses despois da lesión, feeling has returned except in the areas covered by underwear and from the ankles down. My feet are very painful and I have a possibly torn tendon. I’m having that checked next week.
Emotionally – I viewed myself as a Christian with a deeper than average faith and commitment to Jesus. Yet I found myself asking God why this had happened, wanting to know His purpose for it. Through teaching from Living On The Edge’s Chip Ingram, I realized that God had placed His mark and reminder on me. It was time for the next step in my faith journey.
Claro que non foi fácil! It was a lot of anguish, Introspección, oración, and crying that led me to one fateful night where I placed my Cauda Equina Syndrome into His hands. I wanted Him to use me however He could. He was asking to yield to Him in everything and I was finally at the point where I realized that I couldn’t do without that.
I do not know where God will take me. I do have a busy 2014 aliñados! Kim and I are launching a Small Group Ministry at our church, Estou me preparado para facer o exame e profesional Xestión de Contador, and putting my experience with Cauda Equina Syndrome I am becoming involved in a support and education non-profit for Cauda Equina Syndrome which is seeking to grow worldwide. I certainly won’t have much spare time! Not bad for someone who a few months ago was staring a lifelong disability in the face.
Trendyhair was founded in Barcelona in 2012 as a response to the concerns and dreams if its founders to create their own hair care products brand having clocked up 12 years’ experience in the hair cosmetics sector looking for and selecting the best ingredients all around the world in order to create cosmetics for other brands.
“We make prestigious hair care products from the union of unconnected worlds, seemingly antagonistic cultures, industrialisation and age-old alchemy, and that’s how we create a convergent epicentre in a divergent world. We drink from the fountain of fashion culture, from the perfume world and the obsession with travelling. This inspirational world has been materialised with our beauty ritual Elastic. It’s an introspection into ancient Japanese culture turning it into a unique experience in the customer’s salon.”

This project was started in 2003 at the request of the Icelandic Ministry of Fisheries. Until then, monitoring of undesirable substances in the edible portion of marine catches had been rather limited in Iceland.
The purpose of the project is to gather information and evaluate the status of Icelandic seafood products in terms of undesirable substances. The numbers presented are mean values from 2003-2006 samplings.

Apple's third model of Macintosh line (except Lisa/Mac XL) came with many new features. 1MB of RAM, expandable to 4MB, made Plus good in data processing. It was the first Mac to have SCSI port to connect external hard drives (although useless in early units because of ROM bug) and 800kB floppy disk drive instead of earlier 400K. It was using its own keyboard and mouse connectors. Plus was sold until 1990, when Apple decided to use Macintosh Classic as cheaper alternative.
Origin of my unit is not known. I found it in recycling plant and traded for 2 broken mainboards. I can see that it was kept in a good shape earlier - it has even original floppy drive head fixing tool. Unfortunately it's broken as it was kept a few days outdoors and thrown a few times.
On the left side of the computer you can see 2 buttons. If not, you have to look into grilles there - they will be 2 big buttons. One of them resets computer while another one runs internal debugger. This piece of software pops in as a white rectangle with text cursor and allows to do simple operations in memory, reading, dumping, writing bytes, executing programs or running program in memory from specified offset.
Last function can be used to reveal hidden routines in memory. If you type "G 40E118" there and press Enter, you'll get message "Stolen from Apple Computers". This small bitmap was a trap for companies who wanted to copy Macintosh including its ROM and sell it as their own product. Some companies did it, but they made a new, compatible ROM (for example Executor emulator contained re-written ROM to run Mac programs on PC - thanks to Jorpho for info). Some others just copied a whole ROM changing "Apple" to their name in all strings. Because "find-and-replace" works only with text, not bitmaps, this "Stolen from Apple" survives any changes except deep analysis of ROM... which was done only while writing a new one. This was an easy proof that ROM was copied.
Memory upgrading procedure is quite simple if you know what you're doing. First, you have to get 30-pin SIMM modules with sufficient timings. Mac was designed to work with 120-150ns SIMMs, some 80ns should do the job, while 60-70 may cause errors. To test memory you can run Level 2 Testing from bootable MacTest 7.0 service diskette (if you get one). Mac was designed to support 8-bit SIMMs, but 9-bit (8+parity) should work. If you have 8 or 9-chip modules and 3-chip modules, these 8/9-chip ones work in more cases.
But if you think that putting SIMMs to sockets is enough, you're in mistake. If you, for example, upgrade 1MB Plus to 4MB with changing SIMMs only, it'll see a half of it - 2MB. To tell Mac how much memory it has, you have to dig in the mainboard.
Look near reset/interrupt buttond and the serial port sockets, there are 2 resistors (or 1 resistor and 1 place for it, or 2 empty places) in the white square labeled "RAM SIZE". One resistor has label "256K BIT" while the other has "ONE ROW".
It means that to install 4MB, there must be no resistors. While upgrading, cut only one resistor's pin, then move it not to connect - it helps with downgrading.
Ezekiel 26:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first [day] of the month, [that] the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Ezekiel 26:2 Son of man, because that Tyrus hath said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken [that was] the gates of the people: she is turned unto me: I shall be replenished, [now] she is laid waste: Ezekiel 26:3 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I [am] against thee, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up. Ezekiel 26:4 And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock. Ezekiel 26:5 It shall be [a place for] the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken [it], saith the Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil to the nations. Ezekiel 26:6 And her daughters which [are] in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.
Ezekiel 26:7 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring upon Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people. Ezekiel 26:8 He shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against thee, and cast a mount against thee, and lift up the buckler against thee. Ezekiel 26:9 And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his axes he shall break down thy towers. Ezekiel 26:10 By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach. Ezekiel 26:11 With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets: he shall slay thy people by the sword, and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground. Ezekiel 26:12 And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water. Ezekiel 26:13 And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard. Ezekiel 26:14 And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be [a place] to spread nets upon; thou shalt be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken [it], saith the Lord GOD.
Ezekiel 26:15 Thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee? Ezekiel 26:16 Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at [every] moment, and be astonished at thee. Ezekiel 26:17 And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, [that wast] inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror [to be] on all that haunt it! Ezekiel 26:18 Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that [are] in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure. Ezekiel 26:19 For thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and great waters shall cover thee; Ezekiel 26:20 When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that thou be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living; Ezekiel 26:21 I will make thee a terror, and thou [shalt be] no [more]: though thou be sought for, yet shalt thou never be found again, saith the Lord GOD.

Students in all CHD specialty tracks prepare to work with vulnerable populations. Applicants are required to disclose any current or past criminal charges or convictions or pending charges that might result in a conviction, when applying for admission to the CHD program. Failure to report a criminal history may result in denial and/or dismissal from the CHD program. It is the prerogative of the CHD faculty and administration to request additional information about an applicant’s criminal history, and based on the information provided, to deny admission (and/or for CHD students, to dismiss them). Please note that students in license-eligible programs must undergo criminal background checks prior to internship and licensure.
Individuals with a criminal history who apply for a license-eligible track in Counseling and Human Development should contact the Ohio Counselor, Social Worker, and Marriage and Family Therapist Board (www.cswmft.ohio.gov) regarding eligibility for clinical mental health counselor licensure or the Ohio Department of Education (www.ode.oh.us), regarding school counselor licensure eligibility in Ohio.
To register for classes, students must meet with their academic faculty advisors. Students plan their coursework with their advisor on the CHD Prospectus. Students register for classes by submitting their approved registration form to the Student Service Center after they meet with their advisor.
Students who do not intend to pursue a degree in counseling. Generally, these are "licensure only" students who already have a master’s degree and are completing courses required for school or clinical mental health counseling licensure in Ohio. A CHD degree-seeking student cannot be enrolled as a non-matriculated student.
The process of candidacy is internally driven by the CHD program faculty and occurs two times in the academic year. Matriculated students who reach the half-way point in their course work and have completed one or more process courses (i.e., group process, social and cultural diversity, substance abuse) are considered for candidacy. The CHD faculty is responsible for evaluating students’ academic and professional suitability to enter the counseling profession. It is the program’s ethical and professional mandate to protect the public and assure the quality of its graduates. Students are notified of the outcome in writing. Students in Counseling Education and Training tracks must acquire candidacy before registering for practicum.
Upon admission to the CHD program, students are assigned a faculty advisor to help them plan course scheduling. Students are responsible to contact their advisor for help in planning course loads each semester prior to registering. Students must complete a "Prospectus" which serves as a plan of study during their first semester in the CHD program.
As part of the Master’s program graduation requirements, CHD students must successfully pass a final comprehensive examination. This is a capstone assessment of core areas of knowledge required/expected of the profession, as well as a demonstration of your ability to translate the theory and knowledge gained in the curriculum into practical insights related to client/student care. The examination is generally taken during the last semester the student is completing course requirements. Those who fail any section of the comprehensive examination, or the examination as a whole, are required to complete a second examination as determined by the faculty. If the second examination results are also unsatisfactory, matriculation is delayed and course retakes (with specified course competency requirements) are required at the student’s expense. If student performance results in failure of the course retakes (a performance of less than 80%), matriculation is terminated.
Students may simultaneously complete the requirements for any two of the CHD specializations with relative ease. Choose two from Clinical Mental Health Counseling, School Counseling or Student Affairs in Higher Education. In order to have both specializations posted on the diploma, course and specialization-specific requirements for both specializations must be fulfilled before the M.A. degree is conferred.
Once the M.A. is conferred, a student may return to the Counseling and Human Development program as a non-matriculated student to complete courses required for another specialty. A student may not return for a second degree once the M.A. is conferred.
Students may simultaneously complete the requirements for both license-eligible specializations, Clinical Mental Health Counseling and School Counseling in the M.A. in Counseling and Human Development. In order to have both specializations posted on the transcript, all course requirements for school and clinical mental health specialties must be fulfilled, and students must successfully complete CHD 790 - Practicum for Dual Specialization. The CMHC-SC Dual Specialization requires 72 semester hours.
Students may simultaneously complete requirements for the SAHE & CMHC specialties. In order to have both specializations posted on the transcript, all course requirements for both SAHE & CMHC specialties must be fulfilled. The SAHE-CMHC dual specialization requires 78 semester hours.
Students may simultaneously complete requirements for the SAHE & SC specialties. In order to have both specializations posted on the transcript, all course requirements for both SAHE & SC specialties must be fulfilled. The SAHE-SC dual specialization requires 66 semester hours.
CHD faculty members recognize that graduate student training is a developmental process; that is, faculty members understand that professional counseling competencies develop over time. CHD faculty members want to see all matriculated students acquire the competencies necessary for them to function in their professional roles as school, clinical mental health counselors and student affairs professionals, succeed in their graduate studies, and complete their master’s degree. At the same time, CHD faculty members have ethical and professional responsibilities to serve as gatekeepers to the profession by identifying problematic student behaviors, and insufficient student competence in academic, clinical and professional knowledge and skills, including decision making and judgment (for Counselor Education, see ACA Code of Ethics [2014] and 2009 CACREP standards; for Student Affairs in Higher Education, 2006], CAS [2006], ACPA and NASPCA, [2010]). In order to ensure that each student receives timely feedback to improve academic and clinical competencies and correct problematic behaviors, the CHD faculty members adopted a retention policy. The purpose of the retention policy is to establish a systematic means to evaluate students’ competencies and professional behaviors, and to set up a process to address the development (and/or remediation) of students’ professional skills (academic and clinical), and/or professional behavior. The implementation of this policy provides students with information related to the overall progress of their professional development. See the CHD Handbook for complete policy, forms, processes and procedures.
Individuals who hold a master’s degree in counseling which does not meet the licensure requirements in Ohio must obtain a prescription for required coursework from the Ohio Counselor, Social Worker and Marriage and Family Therapist Board. They are eligible for licensure-only (non-matriculated) program at Walsh University.
Individuals who hold a master’s degree in education or counseling other than school counseling must obtain the equivalent of a Walsh school counseling degree to become licensed as a school counselor. They are also eligible for licensure-only (non-matriculated) program at Walsh University.
Chi Sigma Iota is an international honor society of counseling professionals and professionals-in-training who are dedicated to excellence in scholarship, research, and clinical practice. It was established January 1, 1985, and the first initiation was held by the Alpha Chapter of Ohio University in March of 1985. As of May 2018, there are 396 chapters and over 117,000 initiated members. National headquarters are located in Greensboro, N.C.
The Walsh University chapter, Alpha Mu, was established in the spring of 1987 and has grown from five members to over 100 members comprised of either counseling professionals or professionals-in-training. The purpose of Chi Sigma Iota is to promote and recognize exemplary attainment in the study and practice of counseling.
Students enrolled in the Walsh University Graduate Program in Counseling and Human Development in one of the licensure tracks may be invited to join Alpha Mu upon recommendation of the faculty and if they meet the following requirements:
Faculty, alumni, and participating professional counselors who are either certified or licensed and who have given evidence of distinguished scholarship and professional service, including professional credentials and/or graduation from a Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP) approved program, are also eligible to be invited to join.
Membership in the Alpha Mu chapter can make a valuable contribution to the professional development of the counseling student as they become part of a network of professionals who ascribe to high standards of scholarship and practice. Alpha Mu offers many events and programs for CHD students, such as an annual initiation dinner, speakers and programs on current issues and topics relevant to the counseling field, a chapter networking directory, and all-day workshops or seminars with the opportunity to earn continuing education units (CEUs) for license renewal.
Chi Sigma Alpha, the Student Affairs Honor Society, began in the fall of 2002 at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University to promote and recognize excellence in academics, research, and service to the profession of student affairs.
The Walsh University chapter, Alpha Gamma, was established in the fall of 2016. Members include graduate students pursuing the Student Affairs in Higher Education specialty within the CHD program, program alumni, and student affairs professionals.
Students enrolled in the CHD Program may be invited to join upon recommendation of the faculty and the Alpha Gamma Executive Committee, and if they meet the following requirements:
Successful completion of 6 semester hours in the CHD program (provided that they have not been on active social or academic probation while enrolled as a CHD graduate student).
A grade point average of 3.5 or better on the 4.0 scale (which must also be maintained in order for students to remain eligible for membership in Alpha Gamma).
The support of members is essential to the success of our Alpha Gamma chapter in advancing its aims both at Walsh and in partnership with other members and local chapters from various institutions of higher education across the country. Members have a unique opportunity to shape the future of this Honor Society and of the student affairs profession through their active membership and involvement. In doing so, this Society adds value to the personal, professional, and career journey of its members, helping them to thrive as competent students and professionals. Additionally, members of Alpha Gamma become part of a network of peers and professionals who share a commitment to high standards in academics, research, and service to the profession.
For more information on the Walsh University Alpha Gamma chapter of Chi Sigma Alpha, please contact one of the officers or the Faculty Advisor.

The purpose of the Tennessee Board of Regents general education core is to ensure that college graduates have the broad knowledge and skills to become lifelong learners in a global community that will continue to change. Because course requirements in general education emphasis breadth, they are not reduced to the skills, techniques or procedures associated with a specific occupation or profession. As a fundamental element of the associate degree, the general education core is essential for full completion of all degrees.
General education provides critical thinking skills enabling students to discover authoritative answers to questions, and to solve challenging problems. Specifically, educated people practice and are literate in many forms of communication. They recognize their place in the history, culture, and diverse heritage of Tennessee, the United States, and the world. They appreciate the web of commonality of all humans in a multicultural world and are prepared for the responsibilities of engaged citizenship. They recognize the ethical demands of modern life. They demonstrate the skills and knowledge of the social and behavioral sciences to analyze contemporary society. They are familiar with the history and aesthetics of the fine arts. They understand and practice the scientific and mathematical view of the world.
Finally, Tennessee’s general education core provides for its citizens the means to make a better living. It also, perhaps, above all, enables its citizens to have a better life.
Students completing the general education core will minimally demonstrate competencies in each of the following areas:
The ability to write clear, effective academic argument that includes the academic research skills of critical reading and gathering, analyzing, interpreting, and transmitting information.
The ability to analyze/discuss/and use quantitative information, demonstrate a reasonable level of facility in mathematical problem solving and recognize connections between mathematics and other disciplines.
The ability to use the information technologies including word processing, graphical presentation, electronic communication and information gathering.
* Six (6) hours of English composition and three (3) hours in English oral presentational communication are required.
***Students who plan to transfer to Tennessee Board of Regents (TBR) universities should take six (6) hours of American History (three hours of Tennessee History may substitute). Students who plan to transfer to University of Tennessee System universities or to out-of-state or private universities should check requirements and take the appropriate courses.
Foreign language courses will be an additional requirement for the Associate of Arts and the Bachelor of Arts degrees.
****Specific courses satisfying these requirements must be the same courses that satisfy the general education requirement for the associate (A.A./A.S.) and Baccalaureate degrees.
Associate of Arts/ Associate of Science degree programs are designed for the student who desires to transfer to a four-year institution to pursue a baccalaureate degree. The information presented in a university parallel curriculum is not intended to represent requirements for any particular college or university. Students should consult articulation agreements, the catalog of the school to which they intend to transfer and their advisors for information on degree requirements.
Associate of Science in Teaching is a jointly developed degree through the TBR community colleges. Currently, students in the community colleges follow articulation agreements worked out with nearby four-year teacher preparation colleges. With the A.S.T., students will be able to enroll in any TBR teacher education program. Students intending to transfer to the UT system or private institutions should consult a faculty advisor on the appropriateness of this program for transfer.
Associate of Applied Science and Academic/Technical Certificate programs are designed for the student who desires to enter employment upon graduation and does not intend to transfer to a baccalaureate degree program. A student admitted to an Associate of Applied Science program is not required to complete high school units of study required for admission to a university.

The regular business meeting of the Catawba Island Township Board of Township Trustees was called to order by chairman William Rofkar at 7:30 p.m. in the conference room. Present were William Rofkar, Robert Schroeder, Gary Mortus, Pat Cerny, Tony Corona, James Stouffer, Jack DeVore, Matt Montowski, Robert Snyder, Brian Snyder, Randy Riedmaier, Reggie Langford and Meredith Beck. The meeting began with the Pledge of Allegiance.
Gary Mortus made a motion to approve and accept the minutes of the last business meeting seconded by Robert Schroeder. All voted aye. Robert Schroeder made a motion to approve and pay the bills in the amount of $40,546.30 seconded by Gary Mortus. All voted aye.

Ottawa County Board of Elections dates to reserve for elections. The next meeting of the Save our Homes Foreclosure Prevention Task Force is April 2, 2009 5:30 p.m. in the EOC. Prosecutor Mark Mulligan Memo in regard to filing zoning charges. Complaints should be brought to the Prosecutor’s office for filing not the Municipal Court because of insufficient information. Thank you for township’s contribution to the Drug Task Force from Prosecutor’s office and their agents. Ottawa County Engineer’s Annual Report.
Randy Riedmaier, Chief Deputy, presented the 2008 Marine Patrol Report and requested support for 2009. Robert Schroeder made a motion to donate $6000.00 to the Sheriff’s Marine Patrol seconded by Gary Mortus. Robert Schroeder, aye; Gary Mortus, aye; William Rofkar, aye. The Trustees thanked him for a job well done.
Meredith Beck stated there are horses in Cedar Preserve again. Ms. Beck also asked if the township has made on decision on allowing horses in the Preserve. William Rofkar stated a decision was not made. William Rofkar stated he does not have a problem with the horses and the people with horses on Catawba pay taxes also, unless there really is a problem. Gary Mortus stated a decision will have to be made in the very near future before a motion is made as safety is a factor that must be looked into.
William Rofkar stated the Maintenance Department has been putting mulch on the trials at the Nature Preserve at the point and fixing up the parking lot.
Tony Corona stated the Fairway Villas will be installing the last of their water mains this week and next week and there may be some dust and noise.
Reggie Langford stated some gypsy moths were found but not enough concentration to warrant the spraying and he will redirect his focus to educating people on protecting their trees and Reggie would help them with the wrapping of trees, etc. William Rofkar stated the township will keep in touch with Stephanie Miller from ODNR as she is very knowledgeable and a good source for information.
Matt Montowski and the Zoning Commission would like to thank William Rofkar for attending the meeting last month. Matt asked the trustees if they have an opinion on wind powered electrical generators. Robert Schroeder stated he would like to see a drop zone. Gary Mortus stated there are no transmission lines on Catawba. He stated there never will be a wind farm on Catawba. There is no grid here, it is just distribution.
William Rofkar stated we need to add a majority vote, rather than a unanimous vote will be required of the township board of trustees to deny or modify township zoning commission recommendations to our zoning resolution. This is included as part of HB 562. Pat Cerny will check if this is a mandatory change.
Tony Corona asked if the township had any feedback on the condition of Sand Road now that spring is here. William Rofkar said he will check on this and he also stated there may be more work being done on Sand Road on a different project and there would be more digging so we may have to wait.
Gary Mortus stated Police Chief Robert Rogers will be on medical leave starting April 1, 2009 for at least six weeks. Gary Mortus made a motion to increase part-time Police Officer Robert Danklefsen’s wage $2.00 per hour, $12.26 to $14.26 as his base rate. William Rofkar stated he would rather see a little less increase. Gary Mortus made a motion to increase Robert Danklefsen’s wage $1.00 per hour. Motion was not carried due to a lack of a second to the motion.
Tim Rink from the Resurrection Church requested an outdoor LED sign for the church. It will be an electronic message center sign but the message will not be moving.. Gary Mortus stated he would be opposed to this type of sign and William Rofkar stated it could move if someone sets the message to move. Pat Cerny stated she told Mr. Rink she would ask the Trustees for their opinion. Pat Cerny also asked the Trustees if they had time to look at the proposed investment policy. Gary Mortus stated they will look at it at the next business meeting. The State Auditor said if we do any investments we need a policy and we can compose the policy ourselves and the investments are at the discretion of the Trustees.
quit running. The truck was taken to Transmission Unlimited and it was quoted at $6300.00 for repair or replacement. They also recommended that the transmission be serviced annually. They will replace the filters and fluid because the unit moves back and forth and this puts a lot on the transmission. William Rofkar would like to buy two tennis nets for Heigel Park for a cost of $350.00 plus shipping from David Williams & Associates. William Rofkar also asked David Williams & Associates about wood fiber mulch in bulk which is strictly for playgrounds and to give the township an estimate on the amount needed. William Rofkar made a motion to spend up to $2000.00 for new nets and mulch from David Williams & Associates delivered, and our maintenance men will install the nets and apply the mulch. Gary Mortus seconded the motion. Gary Mortus, aye; William Rofkar, aye; Robert Schroeder, nay.
William Rofkar made a motion to approve a 2% raise for Robert Danklefsen relative to the other employee raises. There was no second to the motion. Motion fails.

Hey Siri… wait Alexa? Nope it’s neither its CIMON! Finally astronauts will be getting their own “home” assistant named CIMON made by Airbus. Recently in late June CIMON was sent out with SpaceX’s cargo rocket to the International Space Station, there it will assist and learn with current and future astronauts staying at the station. Hopefully with the start of this friendship, space exploration will become a joint effort between humans and machines. PS it moves easily with NO GRAVITY, so cool!

Hello everyone! Merlin here! Sorry that we haven't been posting or visiting our friends, but things have been incredibly busy around here, and there has been lots of chaos.
First of all, there is our new baby sister, Chloe. We haven't had the opportunity to spend any time with her, for the reasons that follow:
Poor Dragonheart is still experiencing some congestion. The vet recently started him on steroids, and that, along with a new antibiotic, and a continued antiviral, seems to be helping. That said, he is making the trip to Guelph to visit the Health Science Centre Companion Animal Clinic at the Ontario Veterinary College on Tuesday, with our dad, to have a CT scan and an echocardiogram. The x-rays that the vet took to rule out pneumonia or other problems showed that his heart is enlarged, so he needs the echocardiogram to see if his equivocal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has progressed. The CT scan will be to see if his congestion is caused by polyps (hopefully, as they would be benign), or cancer (hopefully not, and not usual in a cat his age of ten). It will also rule out any underlying reasons for the gum hyperplasia he kept having in the summer and fall of 2016. So that's Dragonheart.
Devi had her eosinophilic granuloma skin lesions return. We think she managed to snag some of Chloe's kitten food that got knocked out of the master bedroom, which has become the kitten nursery. Chloe is a typical kitten, going crazy and knocking her dry food everywhere. We are pretty sure some of it flew out to where Devi ate some of it. So poor Devi is back on steroids and antihistamines to clear up her skin. Fortunately those are working, and her skin is looking much better.
As for me, I'm, ironically, the healthiest of the older Sphynx. I'm starting to slow down a bit, either for the steroids, the cancer, or both, and I'm back to having some blood and/or mucus in my stool a couple of times a week. But otherwise I'm doing great!
Chloe is the healthiest of us all, being a growing kitten, full of energy and spunk! She loves bunnykicking the 'nip banana we received from our Secret Paws.
So that's the update on us. Be sure to check in tomorrow for a special celebration! We miss you guys and hope we'll have more time to post and visit soon!
Good to hear from you - as you know the nekkids here are always eager to hear news. And Äiti of course - although with a little girlie sphynxie, we have to be very careful with her: kitten fever is not pretty.
So sorry to read about you adults: Merlin, we trust the poop issues are temporary; Dragonheart our paws are totally crossed for the trip and we hope all goes well with a good diagnosis. ANd Devi - greedy girl! Well shame that such yummy food ends up with problems.
We really hope you get to meet Chloe soon as she is going to need whapping into shape, before she takes over!
We are sorry to hear that so many of you are having health problems. We are sending purrs and hugs that all will be better soon and get to meet Chloe! We have missed you!
We're happy to hear from you, Merlin, and we send lots of purrs to all of you and hope everything and everybuddy are okay.
I hope all your health issues improve. My mum hasn't been going online very much lately, so I haven't done much visiting and didn't know that Chloe had joined your family. She looks very sweet.
Thanks for the update....we worry when we don't hear from you. We hope everyone is feeling better soon.
Thank you for the update on everyone. I am sorry you are having some troubles Merlin, I am praying for you. I will pray for Devi and Dragonheart too. Also, for your sweet new little sister as well.XO
Gosh, you have been having quite a time of it! We are crossing all our paws that everyone is feeling better soon.
wow that is a lot going on-- glad to hear Merlin doing well and best wishes for Dragon heart and Devi! Chloe looks adorable-are they all getting along?
Holy smokes that is a LOT going on!! We hope it all slows down for everyone and that there is good news all around on everyone's health. WE are all purring very hard for all!
Four Sphynx, two boys (Dragonheart and Merlin), two girls (Devi and Chloe), living in Canada. Merlin is fighting large cell lymphoma of the GI tract.

For years, Pat Buchanan has passed off white supremacist ideology as legitimate mainstream political commentary. And MSNBC continues to pay him and give him a platform on national TV to do it.
Buchanan has just published a book which says that increasing racial diversity is a threat to this country and will mean the "End of White America."1 This weekend, to promote his book, he went on a white supremacist radio show whose host has said things like "MLK's dream is our nightmare," and "interracial sex is white genocide."2
Buchanan has the right to express his views, but he's not entitled to a platform that lets him broadcast bigotry and hate to millions. If MSNBC wants to be seen as a trusted, mainstream source of news and commentary, it needs to fire Buchanan now.
"Sonia Sotomayor does believe in race-based justice basically at the expense of white males and to advance people of color. The truth is that's what Barack Obama believes as well."4
"America has been the best country on earth for black folks. It was here that 600,000 black people, brought from Africa in slave ships, grew into a community of 40 million, were introduced to Christian salvation, and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known … no people anywhere has done more to lift up blacks than white Americans. Untold trillions have been spent since the ’60s on welfare, food stamps, rent supplements, Section 8 housing, Pell grants, student loans, legal services, Medicaid, Earned Income Tax Credits and poverty programs designed to bring the African-American community into the mainstream."5
"[Former KKK Grand Wizard] David Duke is busy stealing from me. I have a mind to go down there and sue that dude for intellectual property theft."6
These are just a few of many, many examples of Buchanan's barely-disguised bigotry.7,8Buchanan has defended Hitler.9 He's said that "in a way, both sides were right" during the civil war.10 Buchanan often implies that white people are more intelligent than people of color, and just this weekend (in a different radio interview), he refused to disavow the idea that white people have superior genes.11
In general, Buchanan is pushing a vision of America that portrays white people and "white culture" as genuinely American, and diversity and multiculturalism as a threat to America. Buchanan tries to blame the country's economic problems on programs like affirmative action, welfare, and food stamps — programs which help vulnerable and disadvantaged Americans of every race, but which Buchanan and others on the far right have portrayed as only helping lazy and undeserving minorities. He takes every opportunity to stoke the racial anxiety and fear that exists among some white people. In short, Buchanan wants to pit white people against people of color. He believes in it, he thinks it's good political strategy, and in his new book he encourages the GOP to become "the white party."
If Buchanan didn't have a powerful media platform, he'd be just another person with outdated, extremist ideas. But it's irresponsible and dangerous for MSNBC to promote his hateful views to an audience of millions.

The executive team appointments are in response to the retirements of current COO Ken Lister and executive officer information and control systems Ian Cooke, who have both dedicated decades of their lives to Snowy Hydro. Current executive officer trading, Roger Whitby, has extensive engineering and trading experience, marrying market experience with technical expertise and in-depth knowledge of Snowy Hydro’s unique operations. “Roger is one of Snowy Hydro’s most accomplished Executives,” CEO Paul Broad said. “His appointment as COO will bring together Snowy Hydro’s trading, water, environment and operations team to form a seamless link between the water under our management, our portfolio of generation assets and the national electricity market. “Roger will oversee not only the operation, maintenance and capability of the iconic 4100 megawatt Snowy Scheme assets but also our three gas fired power stations - Laverton North (320MW) and Valley Power (300 MW) in Victoria and Colongra (667MW) in New South Wales, as well as our diesel peak generators in South Australia. Commencing in March 2016, experienced mining executive John McGagh will join the Snowy Hydro executive team in the position of chief digital officer. John has spent the past 30 years in a range of roles at Rio Tinto, the most recent of which was as head of innovation. “He comes to Snowy with a global track record in technology and has been at the forefront of innovation in the mining sector particularly in big data and robotics,” Mr Broad said. “I pay tribute to both Ken Lister and Ian Cooke who have dedicated their lives and careers to Snowy Hydro, our iconic assets and our people,” Mr Broad said. “Along with Roger, Ken and Ian were part of the team that brought together the trading and generation companies to form Snowy Hydro Limited in the early 2000s. “Ken and Ian are both recognised leaders in the Snowy Mountains community and I have no doubt they will continue to be strong contributors in the region.” Ken Lister
UEB Contractions is the third unit of the Mangold Basic Braille Program. The first two units in the Mangold Basic Braille Program; Unit 1: Tracking and Unit 2: Alphabet teach the initial skills that promote rapid and efficient braille reading. Unit 3: UEB Contractions was written for new readers who already know the braille alphabet and is divided into 5 parts (Parts A-E) so that teachers are better able to tailor the program to individual student needs. The parts are designed to be taught in order, but a student can skip a part if the teacher of the visually impaired has determined that the student has already mastered the contractions taught in that part.
Unit 3: UEB Contractions is designed to help teachers of the visually impaired teach reading skills while teaching the braille code. All of the parts in Unit 3 are controlled for contractions and contain both reading and writing exercises. Common words and contractions, that beginning readers encounter, are introduced early in the program to help facilitate early reading. Punctuation and common math symbols are also introduced. The reading exercises include repeated readings, sentence tracking, multiple choice questions and clue activities. The writing exercises include sentence copying, sentence starters and open-ended questions.
Included in each of the parts of Unit 3: UEB Contractions are print reading books (trade books). Ready-to-cut and apply braille labels for each of the print books are also included. These print books give the student an opportunity to read for pleasure. There are picture descriptions in the teacher's manual that may be used by the teacher or parent. All but one of the print books are controlled for contractions.
There are assessment sheets at the end of each part to help teachers determine if their student is ready to advance to the next part.
Note: Teachers who have a Mangold Pushpin Board Kit may use it in place of the Sensational Blackboard.

Chicken Masala is a delightfully simple Indian dish , which is bursting full of color and flavor...!
This is an all time favorite among chicken lovers. The recipe is quite easy to make with spicy ingredients. It makes a elegant side dish with rice or naan ( Indian breads ) and makes for a yummy family meal or special occasion.
Yeah, I got Versatile Blogger award from lovely Stefania of Nuvole di farina. . And Hundred Hearts Award from my wonderful friend Chandrani of Cuisine Delights .
Today I’m sharing a widely popular Indian food & one of my favorite breakfast menu, Masala Dosa. This dosa is delicious as well as spicy. It is best accompanied with Coconut Chutney & Sambar.
You can make the dosa batter in advance. The delicious filling is prepared with mashed potato, green chilly and spices. Then it is stuffed inside the golden crisp dosa and served hot.
My MIL used to prepare this Thuvaiyal, whenever we visit our native place. It tastes yummy and very easy to prepare too. It makes a good side dish with any heavy meal, due to its digestive properties.

The brand began its journey by launching a hair therapy treatment by way of a ritual for exclusive use in hair salons: The Ritual. The treatment is formulated with the highest quality ingredients: pure keratin, ginseng and Actiscent® Parfum micro particles to replenish the hair’s wellbeing and stimulate its growth. I want to point out that the fragrance that Trendyhair use is active, unlike others, and it contains a significant amount of vitamins, proteins and amino acids that act cosmetically (in addition to their scent) on the hair.
A USDA study found that the tart white rind offers a high dose of citrulline, an amino acid that helps dilate blood vessels to improve circulation.

Last Tuesday, a federal judge in Texas issued a nationwide injunction against a new regulation expanding the number of workers who would be eligible for time-and-a-half overtime pay. The new overtime regulations were to take effect December 1, 2016. The new regulations would have raised the salary limit below which workers automatically qualify for overtime pay to $47,476 from $23,660 resulting in increased pay for millions of employees in both the for-profit and non-profit sectors.
The judge ruled that the U.S. Department of Labor exceeded its authority when it issued the regulations that changed the criteria for determining which executive and administrative employees are “exempt” from being paid overtime by revising the salary threshold that triggers the overtime pay exemption. The injunction stops the new rule from becoming law. It does not alter existing federal and state laws regarding fair labor standards, including properly classifying employees as being exempt from or entitled to being paid overtime.

In February, President Trump vowed to “get rid of and totally destroy” the provision preventing 501(c)(3) organizations from engaging in partisan politics. Currently, organizations exempt from taxation under IRC §501(c)(3) are prohibited from supporting or opposing candidates or spending resources to support or oppose candidates. This prohibition is occasionally referred to as the Johnson Amendment as it was introduced by Senate Minority Leader Johnson in 1954.
The Johnson Amendment ensures that 501(c)(3) organizations remain above the political fray by withholding exempt status (or revoking it) from organizations that engage in any amount of political activity. Requiring 501(c)(3) organizations to abstain from involvement in political activity ensures that they are able to remain dedicated to their missions without the distraction and divisiveness that partisan politics creates. Rather than squabbling over partisan issues, these organizations (regardless of their social missions) are able to devote their time and efforts to furthering their exempt purposes and bettering the community. Allowing exempt organizations to engage in political activity would open the door for politicians and others seeking endorsements and financial contributions to disrupt the missions and charitable purposes these organizations seek to fulfill with partisan politicking. The focus would be drawn away from the substance of the issues to which these organizations currently devote their resources and towards political parties and partisanship. These organizations would no longer be a place for people to come together to solve community problems, but rather would become yet another institution subject to the caustic partisanship that is dividing our country.
While Mr. Trump frames the issue as involving religious freedom, the implications of abolishing this restriction are far more widespread than that. When an individual donates to a charity, the general public is subsidizing that individual’s preference in causes in the form of a tax break. Each dollar an individual is able to deduct in taxable income is money that the government does not get to collect and use for government programs. However, this reduced revenue is tolerated because of the benefit the community receives through the work of these exempt organizations. The tradeoff for subsidizing a taxpayer’s choice of where to spend her charitable dollars is that these exempt organizations are prohibited from using these funds to benefit insiders, engage in more than an insubstantial amount of lobbying, or participate or intervene in political campaigns.
By eliminating the Johnson Amendment and allowing exempt organizations to participate in political campaigns, donors would essentially be able to deduct the cost of funding political campaigns. Because the contributions would be deducted by the individuals making them, the general public would effectively be subsidizing donations to political campaigns. Additionally, a repeal of the Johnson Amendment would result in even more anonymous (and now tax deductible) money flowing into political campaigns. Further, individuals may stop supporting charitable organizations in an effort to prevent their donations from being redirected to a political campaign. Thus, charitable organizations and the communities they serve may be harmed by an influx of charitable donations intended for political campaigns rather than the charitable mission and a reduction in contributions from donors wary of supporting partisan politics.
Regardless of one’s political affiliation, a nonprofit sector devoted to partisan politics rather than fulfilling the exempt purposes for which it was established is not one that is worthy of the preferred status it currently enjoys.
Make sure your voice is heard – sign the Community Letter in Support of Nonpartisanship and share with others to let your Senators and Representatives know that you oppose efforts to politicize charities.

The wheels on the first car (Lexus GS430? Nissan something?) were merely large, so Goldilocks tried the 4th-gen 1995 Camaro on thirty-inch monstrosities but found it was like riding in an oversized bouncy baby carriage. But the mama bear's third-gen 1985 Camaro Z28 on 22s was just right.
There's something so willfully, childishly over-the-top about modifying a car to ride on oversized wheels shod with rubber less than three inches tall, completely ruining the ride, risking wheel damage at every pothole, and forcing you to drive and corner gingerly at less than 40 mph. Especially when the original car's tiny disc and drum brakes leave gaping holes to peer through. Hot Wheels toy cars brought to life. It makes me want to get “38” badges in iced diamonds for my Subaru — cm, baby, rollin' metric style!
In my area there aren't many classic 70s-80s Impalas and Caprices available, so people have turned all kinds of sedans into Hi-Risers on gigantic rims. I saw a 90s Jaguar XJ in purple on 28-inch wheels.
There's some low-rider culture too, I occasionally see deep red Monte Carlos with engraved windows tooling around on small gold-spoke wheels. South of San Jose I saw two Lincoln Navigators rolling on tiny wheels, which turns an aggressive behemoth into a friendly bus with running boards lower than the curb.
I'm not too sure on the economics of spending several thousand dollars per wheel on these, but it's hella entertaining.
Check out the wheels! I remember seeing these "teddy bear" wheels in car magazines, I thought they were by Koei, but these are by Ronal. Note the wheel lock in the belly button.
I've been meaning to update my Civic page with more information about that incomparable design. Car Styling magazine was kind enough to photocopy the pages about the entire third-generation "Civic Renaissance" design program from issue 44 for me. It was a global tour de force, a single program delivered this fantastic hatchback, the Civic sedan, the CRX pocket-sized sport coupe, the innovative Civic "Space" Shuttle all-wheel drive (much better than a fat tall SUV), and the Ballade variants for the Japanese domestic market. Wow.
Tony Ikeda, Ed Watts, Truman Pollard and myself were the designers working on the project. All my designs were of the long-roof concept and we were in competition with Hiroshi Zaima and the HGW staff in Japan.

In A historical past of the area when you consider that Sep 11 Dominic Streatfeild expertly combines historical past, biography and investigative journalism to teach how a bloodbath on a transparent September day in 2001 has touched the lives of hundreds of thousands of individuals worldwide. In a chain of brilliantly interlinked chapters he exhibits how an Afghani marriage ceremony get together; and a fuel station owner in Texas; and a planespotter in Mallorca were affected, occasionally devastatingly, by way of the yankee reaction to the assaults at the dual Towers. Streatfeild indicates how the sleep of cause and sturdy feel in successive US administrations post-9/11 has introduced forth the monsters of striking rendition, Guantanamo Bay, extrajudicial execution and wholesale contravention of foreign legislation. it is a paintings that informs because it entertains and induces outrage because it evokes.
During this soaking up heritage, Jon C. Teaford strains the dramatic evolution of yankee metropolitan lifestyles. on the finish of global battle II, the towns of the Northeast and the Midwest have been bustling, racially and economically built-in components frequented by means of suburban and concrete dwellers alike. but on account that 1945, those towns became peripheral to the lives of such a lot american citizens.
From Amazon: "This textual content appears at large, the 1st movie to earn over a thousand million cash on the worldwide box-office. This epic movie reimagines one of many defining occasions of the twentieth century throughout the lens of yankee romanticism. "
In gangster lore, the Almighty Black P Stone kingdom sticks out one of the so much infamous of highway gangs. Louis Farrakhan employed the Blackstone Rangers as his Angels of loss of life. Fifteen years prior to Sep 11, the U. S. govt accused the Stones of plotting family terrorist acts with Libyan chief Muammar Qaddafi.
136 In the end, the second version, with a title page that mimicked that of the Paris in all details and an imprint naming Neben as the printer, appeared in Offenbach in 1609. Not surprisingly, de Thou was furious. In the Paris edition in duodecimo of 1609, which failed to compete in price with the unauthorised edition of Goldast and Reuter, he added the following savage prefatory remark: What the writer of these histories has wanted newly to be declared at the beginning of this work is his displeasure at the ambition of those miserable meddlers who seek to appear clever through the writings of others [ .
The negotiations for its publication were conducted by Schobinger or his family, who entrusted the manuscript to the printer Johann Ludwig Brem. Brem’s presses were located in Lindau, a small town on the shores of Lake Constance. They probably chose him because he was the most accessible printer to St. 53 Brem himself did not have an intimate knowledge of the Latin market for books or of the Frankfurt book fair. 54 The book was attractive enough as a proposition for the largest booksellers at the fair, the Willers of Augsburg, under the instigation of Marcus Welser, to offer to buy a hundred copies; but the inexperienced Brem tried to make him buy the whole edition of 1,500, and so risked losing the deal.
25 They were supported also by a section of the remaining Calvinists in the city, who were accused by a contemporary Catholic polemicist of being behind the Fettmilch revolt. In contrast, the surrounding territories governed by rulers of the Reformed faith proved to be hospitable to the Jewish refugees. 26 During the time of Goldast’s residence, Frankfurt was thus a city reflecting the tensions of a wider Europe. 27 I have already mentioned the group of Calvinist scholars based in Heidelberg, In Medias Res • 15 some of whom attended the Frankfurt fair quite regularly, and possibly other book fairs in the region (notably Strasbourg).

Thanks to your comment. I will change it like outlook express does but I need some time for testing. Will state it in changes log once the problem is solved.
I'm using Milestone and upgraded to Android version 2.1. I found that many of the treads (not all treads) are shown in wrong encoding, although the menu of headlines could be shown correctly. By the way, before upgrading Android to version 2.1, there was no problem. I'm not sure if this is the reason...
The reason why new Milestone 2.1 rom has such problem is because the rom come with non TW / TW locale and therefor the default charset will set to utf-8 instead of big5.
and for these non HK / TW locale phone, please remember to set charset (set to big5) in "Server Options" in order to having correct decoding when browsing Hong Kong local usenet group.

Heartland is the evocative debut from 24 year old Portland, Oregon resident Dylan Stark. Tropical and immersive the album offers pure, exhilarating escapism. Brimming with sensation, emotion, spontaneity, reflection, and general human-ness this is celebration music.
Heartland is an album about the evocative power of music, created from thousands of samples that Stark brings to life as if conducting an orchestra. There is an emotional awakening that imbues the album with a joyous aesthetic that seems neither forced nor self-aware, but beautifully ingenuous.
In a world where the development of countless want-to-be producers is immediately uploaded with the need for instant evaluation and affirmation, Dylan's quiet patience and confidence has allowed him to create an exceptionally mature debut that is emotional and powerful enough that it doesn’t require any explanation or personality to be attached.

It is the culmination of 3 years work, collecting field recordings, delving into restricted archives, sampling lost African VHS and reinterpreting discovered African melodies and rhythms, for synths and drum machines.

Produced by Richard Norris and featuring Radio and Single mixes, Drums of Death, Alexis Raphael, Brunt Islands Casuals on Remix duties and Richard Norris’ Album Extended Mix. The Third single from Sheffield four piece Starlings.
Black Waves is 4 tracks of deep, dark club music. Since the release of his critically acclaimed album “Generation Hexed”, Drums of Death has been obsessively developing a deeper and darker sound that is tailored for the dance-floor. Black Waves fuses frantic 808 drum patterns and dramatic synth lines with fresh, contemplative melodies.
Starkey and Charli XCX. Lost space single. Includes the Radio Edit, Starkey's VIP mix, and and exclusive remix from NYC's Kuhn remix as well as Om Unit, Darling Farah and Innerpartysystem remixes.
The first extended player from Detroit born, Adu Dhabi based, Teenage "One to Watch" Darling Farah. Four tracks of deep techno and future house with warmth and soul. Stripped down 5.a.m atmospherics, combine with distorted stabs, dub-like sub-bass and expertly cut vocals.
Starkey forges ahead in the sonic space race with his new, sci-fi inspired EP. Space Traitor Vol 2 is the sequel to 2010’s Vol 1 and looks certain to further cement Starkey as one of the most forward-thinking artists in post-dubstep, bass-driven music.
The four-piece, together for little over a year, use elements of Sheffield’s electronic past to remind us that the Steel City was once the UK’s heart and soul of synthesised electronic music. Produced by Richard Norris, this is the second single from hotly tipped Sheffield 4 piece STARLINGS.
Part 3 in the 3D trilogy is the four painstakingly crafted tracks of 'Sis Sürpriz'. Traditional Turkish folk instruments coupled with modern, synthetic sounds on an EP that’s full of eastern promise.
Om Unit has blasted his sound into deep space, adding eerie electronic futurism to his niche blend of slow boogie, house, techno and hip-hop beats with those classic analogue synth lines. Dark, futuristic and dancefloor oriented, punctuated with elements of 80’s Detroit Techno. This is Electro.
This is the sound of the end of the world, of machines breaking and technology folding, when all that’s left is carnal rage and chaos. A forceful onslaught of sound, the four tracks on Reso’s ‘War Machine / Valkan’ EP intricately mesh high amp leads and emphatic beats that entrance any dancefloor into riotous frenzy.
Carving a square-wave trail out of the underground, Jonny Faith’s debut EP Blue Sky On Mars demonstrates a devastating knack for penning organic, computer dub infused with a cosmic sensibility. Drawing on the 8-bit dub template, Faith has managed to craft his own brand of distinctive beats/bass music.
Influenced by the song writing and production of 80's greats Simple Minds, Heaven 17 and more prominently Talk Talk, Starlings infuse 90’s dance bass lines with tripped-out dub guitars and psychedelic choruses. Produced by Richard Norris with remixes from Starkey, Drums Of Death and cosmic disco bloggers The Bicep DJ’s.
Space Traitor Vol 1 is the first of two EPs from producer Starkey. This intergalactic expedition closely follows Starkey’s acclaimed Ear Drums And Black Holes album and marks another step forward in the expansion of his high definition, sci-fi ‘streetbass’ sound.
The first outing from Detroit born, Adu Dhabi based, Teenage "One to Watch" Darling Farah. The stripped down beat and subtle swing of minimal techno is given a fresh electro sensibility from the distorted chords and cut up vocals, fused together with the sophistication of house and hints of dub.
Reso’s third release for Civil Music, Temjin EP, is 6 tracks across 2 slabs of musical genius that simultaneously moves a whole spectrum of electronic genres forward. On Temjin wobble, hypercrunk, breaks, wonky, hip-hop and D n B all receive the treatment.
Please buy/donate: All proceeds from the sale of the release are donated to the UNICEF Haiti Earthquake Children’s Appeal.
A voyage through international influences taking in, and tweaking out, sounds associated with the Middle East, Europe, West Coast America and Africa. Synth-funk futurist Débruit follows ‘Let’s Post Funk ’ with this four-track tour de force.
East London’s beat collaborators Reason or Romanza join Civil Music. Sitting firmly between Soulful Electronica and Forward-Thinking Soundscapes these two south-end on sea beat collaborators have found new pastures in the fields between Four tet and Flying Lotus.
Grotty, liquid, dark, brutal and lush are all words used to describe the music of Reso, such a contrasting set of adjectives are hard to understand but after a listen to this EP and other productions, you begin to understand why. A drummer at heart, these natural patterns of “skin hitting” are engrained through on his digital programming and productions.
Kotchy's debut album '89ʼ is without doubt a pretty unique presence in todayʼs sonic spectrum and touches on so many different styles throughout the 16 tracks. Kotchy plays nearly everything you hear on ʻ89ʼ, his distinctive hushed-style vocals feature throughout.
The precursor to Kotchy's debut album '89' showcases the club savvy hip-hop of 'Check Out My Keychain' and 'A Superstar' both taken from the album. Intelligent and lyrically engaging with percussive talent is there for all to see. Glamorous and seductive, upbeat and inspiring.
Here's the latest installment of remixes from up and coming remixers via the highly influential Palmsout Blog. 100s of submissions from secret big name monikers through to the best bedroom masters have been whittled down to 5 standout remixes.
Technoid, robo bass-smith Reso delivers the 4th release from Civil Music and strikes you right between the eyes, chest, legs and ears. Still relatively stepping out of the shadows Reso delivers a statement on vinyl.
'Sing What You Want' groove, beats and captivating vocals deliver a Hip Hop affair with a top line that oozes style. Clipped out beats are laced with synth leads, melody and vintage NYC feel. This is intelligent, deconstructive, dub-conscious dance music.
“She Made it Easy” is the first taste of Kotchy. It’s a 4/4 hybrid of NYC disco and emo esq guitar. Glitched and whispered it’s a tale of a girl who entered and left his life, but, somewhat unusually, draws inspiration from the ease of the break as oppose to the pain of it.
DODFUCKSUPANESCORTTUNE is a 1 sided 12” picture disc. The debut release from Drums of Death, and on it you’ll find exactly what you’d expect from the title, Drums of Death fucking up NYC revered band Escort namely their legendary track “Starlight”. Official, approved and made for the dancefloor.
HA! I read this out loud to my mom–she wants to know what the opposite of deductive reasoning is (if one exists). Let’s start with what the opposite of deductive reasoning isn’t…
I guess those early childhood courses on deductive logic and reasoning skills helped make you a very naughty salaryman, eh? It was supposed to help you with academic studies, not in torture methods!
I’ve thought about the opposite of deductive reasoning for a few days now, and I still can’t figure out the best answer. I’m gonna enlist Kevin’s help.
I don’t know if it’s an opposite, exactly, but deductive reasoning is often matched against INductive reasoning.
I’ve just arrived on a planet where, according to the most trustworthy locals, it always rains at 5PM on Wednesday afternoon. Like clockwork. Right now it’s 4:30PM on Wednesday. I reason that, in 30 minutes, it’ll be rainy.
I’m living on a planet where it rains. I get the wacky idea of testing the rain’s frequency. After careful experimentation over time, I see that the rain arrives on the dot every Wednesday at 5PM. I establish the principle: “It rains every Wednesday at 5PM.” Further experimentation shows that the rain never violates this rule. At this point, I’ve become one of the trustworthy locals who can pass this information along to new arrivals to the planet.
Scientific method usually involves a combination of inductive and deductive methods. Language teaching does as well, but sometimes there’s debate about which is better.
For example, the old-school way of teaching language was more deductive: students of French would receive verb charts showing how verbs are conjugated. Memorize the chart, then apply the rules you’ve learned to the new verbs you encounter. The new communicative approaches, however, are less rule-oriented and more about being “in” the language. After you hear “je parle, tu parles, il parle, nous parlons, vous parlez, ils parlent” a few dozen times, it dawns on you that other verbs follow this pattern as well. You induce the rule. Some say this is a better way to learn because you’ve “earned” the knowledge as opposed to having it handed to you cut and dried.

It’s a not-for-profit wildlife park and education facility which opened in 1993. The Center is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.
The Center has a number of exhibitions that look at grizzlies, wolves, ground squirrels, and birds of prey. It is currently working on a Riparian Habitat exhibition to include river otters, cutthroat trout, boreal toads, and American dippers. A new habitat in the works will feature river rapids.
The animals the Center keeps were orphans, born in captivity, or urban nuisance animals threatened with death.
What the Center does to care for the animals and what it teaches the public are cutting-edge and absolutely worth a visit!
Located in the northwest section of Yellowstone, right here in Wyoming, you’ll find an area through which Glen Creek flows north on its path to Gardner River. It’s Golden Gate Canyon.

In this poem (1955), Brassens is borrowing a device of the French medieval poets by using the format of a pretend last will and testament to create some interesting and entertaining themes. The themes that Brassens deals with in his testament poem were triggered by a chance incident that he had witnessed. He had met a slow moving funeral procession which had taken the wrong turning and had been obliged to turn round and start again. This gave Brassens the fascinating idea that the corpse was doing a runner to escape the tomb.
The details of the will are in the final verses and, although there are humorous elements, we note that Brassens, in his early thirties, was writing a complete poem about his own death. Commentators have estimated that Brassens mentions death in two out of every three of his songs. There was reason for his pessimism as he had begun to suffer chronic health problems as early as the late 1940s. He was to be struck by his first serious illness in 1959, while still in his thirties and in spite of his escape fantasies, death came to him when he was only sixty.
1) Le Testament - The title that Brassens chose for his song was also the title of the major poetic work of François Villon. (1431 -1463). In these poems, Villon uses the device of a pretend will, which was popular in French poetry of the Middle Ages.By describing what he is leaving to people he likes and people he doesn’t like, the poet is able to amuse and voice opinions. Brassens had made a song of Villon’s most famous poem “Ballade des dames du temps jadis”(1953). In Brassens’ song we have to wait for a few verses to find out what exactly he is leaving. Later in the poem, he refers again to Villon. (See note 11 below)
2) "Va-t'en voir là-haut si j'y suis." – Although Brassens’ god is a bit tiresome, following him everywhere he goes, he’s also quite human and likes his little joke at the expense of those serious folk who have spent a portion of their time on earth disputing about the existence of God.
3) Le chêne ou le sapin – The oak coffin would be for a rich man and the pine for a poor man. Brassens has no way of knowing which wood will be used for his coffin, because show business is an uncertain career and popularity rises and falls.
4) Je prendrai le chemin le plus long – Brassens has a great love of life and is in no hurry to die. This idea of accepting death but spinning it out as long as possible becomes the refrain of a much later poem, “Mourir pour des idées” 1972.
5) )Tombe buissonnière – The idiom for playing truant is ; « faire l’école buissonnière », literally to get your schooling hidden in the bushes. When he saw a funeral hearse taking the wrong road, Brassens had the vision of the corpse in the coffin sneaking off from his own funeral and the phrase came to him : « Faire la tombe buissonière », because it had the same ring. A few days later his mind went back to the funeral that lost its way and some other images came into his mind. To the image of “faire la tombe buissonière” was added “le chemin d’écoliers” and “la marguerite des morts”. Finally he had eight images that pleased him and around them he wove his song.
(This is a summary of Brassens’ own explanation, which he gives in his introductory remarks to the second video of this song, which I have posted below)
6) Je rêv' d'encor' m'enjuponner – In my personal interpretation of these lines of the poem, Brassens is going over in his mind how it will be to say goodbye to his beloved Joha for the last time. This line links to her because in the poem which describes meeting her in the first flush of love, “J'ai rendez-vous avec vous”, he also speaks of getting enveloped in her skirts:
He closes with his last « I love you » and is being untypically sentimental. (He pulls himself together in subsequent lines!)
7) Qui est la marguerite des morts.- In the Catholic countries of Europe including France, chrysanthemums have become symbols of death and are associated predominantly with funerals and graves. The flowers can be daisy-like and in France a term for them is “ marguerite de l'été de la Saint Martin” , because as an autumn flower they often enjoy Indian Summers in October and November. This gives Brassens the link to the phrase: “Effeuiller la marguerite”. This refers to the game that lovers play, plucking the petals of the daisy, while saying “She loves me – she loves me not.” He uses this image in much the same way in his song to Joha: “Saturne” and in in “Les amours d’autan”, the image becomes an image for sexual lovemaking:
8) ma veuve s'alarme - « S’alarmer » in the everyday usage means to get alarmed, which does not seem quite to describe the feelings expected on the part of his bereaved partner, Joha. In classical literature the verb was used with the meaning: « to be overcome with emotion » and Brassens would like to suggest without being too presumptuous. At this point the sentiment ends and Brassens starts to tease, when he suggests that the love he leaves behind might need an onion to produce tears for his departure.
9) D'autres chats à fouetter – This unfortunate image of whipping cats gives idioms such as « Il a d’autres chats à fouetter », which means he has other things to deal with. Some people read Brassens’ use of this expression as a warning not to meddle with his songs, but Brassens’ love for his cats was such that the literal meaning must apply, which he has enhanced with the metaphor. A major grievance he had against the devastatingly seductive Jo was that she was nasty with his cats- (Putain de toi).
10) Il y'a un fantôme – In this and other poems, Brassens assumes that once the unpleasant transition of death has been accomplished, the person lives on in disembodied form, much as before. In “Supplique pour être enterré sur la plage de Sète”, his idea of heaven is relaxing on a pedalo off the beach of Sète for eternity.
12) La fosse commune du temps - It is time which remorselessly determines the common fate of all people.
In the introduction to this version of "Le Testament", Brassens explains in detail his composition technique on writing this song:
As I evaluate recovery options, I can't provide a certain timeline or prognosis as to to when or to what degree Ma.gnolia or your bookmarks will return; only that this process will take days, not hours.

The Rise of Social Distribution Networks: by John Borthwick on Silicon Alley Insider. “Today there seems to be a new distribution model that is emerging. One that is based on people’s ability to publically syndicate and distribute messages — aka content — in an open manner. This has been a part of the internet since day one — yet now its emerging in a different form — it’s not pages, it’s streams, its social and so its syndication. The tools serve to produce, consume, amplify and filter the stream.”
Steve Ballmer Interview: in The New York Times. “I want the culture of your company to be more efficient…That’s the direction that every business leader is steering their company culture toward right now. Given the current economic climate and the uncertainty about how long the recession will last, this is a time when organizations need to do more with less.”
The Lost Art of Reading Aloud: in The New York Times. “Reading aloud recaptures the physicality of words. To read with your lungs and diaphragm, with your tongue and lips, is very different than reading with your eyes alone. The language becomes a part of the body, which is why there is always a curious tenderness, almost an erotic quality, in those 18th- and 19th-century literary scenes where a book is being read aloud in mixed company. The words are not mere words. They are the breath and mind, perhaps even the soul, of the person who is reading.”

As for myself, i was a little shocked to Stevie say Efficient. I would have thought what MS needs most is innovation – be it in simplifying/uncluttering their current suite products or developing something anew.
Surprising, given especially that with Ray Ozzie at the helm, i would think they would see the value of trying something outside the traditional MS mold. Or Not 🙂
I think Election Commission needs to make sure that elections do not stretch for month and a half. It was too much. And, they did fail to counter the violence in Naxalite infected areas. So, essentially, a better policy is needed to check violence across disturbed areas.

Heading up to Syracuse tonight, then driving with JH to conduct a usability test with students in Red Creek, NY. Interested to see their reactions to the interfaces.
I just got back from my trip. I had such an amazing time there and we did decide to commit to a more serious relationship. Even though we haven’t seen each other for years, we just felt really comfortable around each other. I’m just so glad that we were able to be open and honest about our feelings and thoughts. I really can’t stress enough about how my sessions with Emily gave me the opportunity and courage to be able to fall in love again. I realized that it’s not about being able to trust any and every guy who comes along in my life. It’s about being able to fully trust the right guy for me and neurofeedback has truly helped me realize this.
I consulted Emily for NeurOptimal® partly out of curiosity, and partly I was dealing with two highly stressful situations. I found that the neurofeedback helped me to more easily access a calmer, more intuitive state where I could see more clearly, get less ‘triggered’, be more at peace and make better choices. Although I noticed a huge difference in my state of mind for about 48 ours after the first few sessions, overall I would say that the changes are subtle but profound. I’ve had about 10 sessions, and plan to have some more, just to see how good it can get. Emily Rosen is highly intuitive and insightful, and a great guide if you want to explore your potential as well as address challenging issues.
NeurOptimal® has given me mental relief. Now, instead of a problem overwhelming me, I get to overwhelm my problem! I can proudly that say after being on medication for over 20 years, I am medication free. I enjoy and look forward to my weekly visits with Emily. She is the most empathetic person I ever met. She provides a relaxed and calming atmosphere. I’m so glad I found her and NeurOptimal®. Additionally, my eight-year-old son was diagnosed with ADHD and was receiving the traditional neurofeedback training. I compared my progress to his and decided that mine was better. So he stopped working with his previous trainer and he now trains with Emily. In just a few sessions, I have seen a difference in his behavior. He is much more relaxed, seems happier and does his homework as soon as he gets home from school. Emily is amazing with children. The first time we went to see her; she was very patient and caring. She took her time talking to my son and got him comfortable very quickly. I am looking forward to seeing his improvements develop on a weekly basis.
I’ve found NeurOptimal® neurofeedback with Emily has been a breakthrough for helping my disrupted sleep pattern. I couldn’t tolerate the side effects of what I had been prescribed after numerous sleep tests, and I was afraid nothing would ever help. The NeurOptimal® modality is complementary and has allowed me to explore low dose medication but remains the primary therapy. It enhances a sense of overall well being and I can feel the benefits after the sessions and building over time, which has been a welcome “side effect” as there are none otherwise. Emily offers insights and feedback as needed to ensure there is maximum benefit from NeurOptimal®, guiding the process carefully and completely.
Emily Rosen has our eternal gratitude and affection. We started our adoption journey with little understanding of the process, and even less confidence in its eventual successful outcome. Emily took us under her wing, and shared not only her expertise and knowledge, but (more important by far) she shared her kindness, compassion, understanding and patience. From the initial overwhelming avalanche of paperwork and the psychological perils of the home study, throughout the endless, empty months of waiting for the referral, to the final tumultuous two weeks in China, Emily was our rock.
Unwavering and steadfast, she was always there for us, providing just what was needed at the moment, whether it was an explanation of some abstruse technical point, or simply an encouraging pat on the hand. I write this on the seventh anniversary of the day our daughter was placed in my arms for the first time, and I know that Emily’s unflagging efforts on our behalf are in large part responsible for this, and every other moment that we have had together.
Emily worked tirelessly with my husband and me from the moment we were first thinking about choosing a program; through Home Study and approval; through an extended wait process which proved to be more complicated than anticipated; through some circuitous and unexpected scenarios that presented themselves; through some opportunities and some difficult losses; through bureaucratic headaches and potential heartaches; and, finally, through the entire joyful, magnificent homecoming of our child.
Emily was skilled not only at navigating the trickiest tangles of red tape, but even more skilled at seeing us through the trickiest tangles of our anxieties as we waited. We came to depend on her equally for both of those sets of skills, and when our child came home, it felt like her triumph as well as ours. We are forever appreciative.
Emily was knowledgeable, calm, and warmly caring throughout our adoption process. We remember Emily with great fondness and don’t know what we would have done without her.
Emily Rosen took us through our first adoption of our daughter from Colombia. We had a wonderful experience working with her and felt tended to, respected, and always had our questions answered thoughtfully, knowledgeably and without delay. We were always thankful to have been paired with Emily as our social worker at the time. It was not until our second adoption –when we were paired with someone else– that we realized just how lucky we had been. The world of adoption is complicated by paperwork, emotions, delays, unknowns etc. and we came to understand, explicitly, that not everyone is as gifted as Emily to work through the issues the prospective parents face with such professionalism and care. I will recommend her always to anyone at any point in the adoption journey.
The adoption process can be overwhelming. There is so much paperwork, waiting, decision-making, and uncertainty. It’s really helpful to have guidance from someone with experience and an understanding of the complicated process. Emily was helpful to me in this respect, listening to my concerns and fears and providing sound, caring support. With many years of experience in the adoption field, her insights are extremely helpful, and she’s a lovely, thoughtful, down-to-earth woman! I brought my incredible daughter home from China after a nearly 3-year wait. The entire adoption experience has been amazing from start to finish, and I feel so fortunate to be the mother to a beautiful, charming, curious girl.
When we first met Emily we were about a year into the adoption process. We were feeling overwhelmed, vulnerable, and starting to question whether a family would be in our future at all. But meeting Emily ended up being the turning point. She was with us through the times of hope and there for us through the times of great disappointment that inevitably come with trying to start a family through adoption.
She is a patient, caring and genuine person who clearly loves what she does. We remember going to meet with her and arriving exhausted from the subway ride and feeling exasperated from the challenges of the week but we always left her office holding hands and walking back through Central Park feeling revived.
As we write this, Hattie, our 6 month old daughter is playing in her jumper beside us, laughing, squealing and demanding our attention. She is a perfect little girl and has brought more joy to our lives than we could ever have imagined. Emily played a key role in bringing her into out lives and we are so grateful to have met her. Needless to say it takes a lot more than a subway ride from Brooklyn to the Upper West Side to exhaust us now!
A friend who is very knowledgeable about neurofeedback referred me to Emily. Emily is always kind, gentle and warmhearted. Since the changes brought about by neurofeedback are often reported to be subtle, I decided to keep a journal in which I noted any changes I noticed in my emotional states or life in general. I wanted to share this journal with Emily and she greeted this proposal with heartening enthusiasm, read all of my offerings avidly and seemed thrilled that I was doing this. Her enthusiasm was contagious and I felt more and more encouraged not only to keep on journaling but to actually LOOK for changes in my life. Emily is warm, accepting, kind and generous and I have gotten a lot out of my work with her and it is with joy and delight that I recommend her and neurofeedback.

Sticker paintings are used to manufacture stickers on large scale which uses the panting for an exact cut out.
As Christianpost reviews, the recent video on the destruction of ancient monuments by Islamic State in the Middle East has shocked the international community. The ISIS has sought to justify destruction of Assyrian ancient monuments in Northern Iraq by Islamic norms. The International community’s reaction was predictable: the United Nations’ cultural agency labeled those actions as a war crime, calling the world to “respond to this criminal chaos that destroy culture” and “put an end to this catastrophe”. Strong condemnation also came from global advocacy groups and academic circles that stressed that “ISIS” intent not only to control the future of humankind but also to erase and rewrite our past”.
The destruction of cultural heritage is not a new phenomenon. Different historical sites and monuments were being hammered throughout the history of humankind. It is very disturbing that vandalism, coming from ancient times still continues to exist in the contemporary world. It is especially alarming when such tactics is used not only by radical groups, but also by states in order to re-write the past.
Terrorist group desecration is heinous enough, but what will the world community do when a recognized government does it?
In 2001, the Taliban detonated statues of Buddha in Bamiyan, central Afghanistan. The demolition was described as internal matter of Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and “justified” by the statues’ contradiction to Islamic beliefs. The detonation was a culmination of cultural terrorism conducted by Taliban in Afghanistan to entirely eradicate Afghan cultural heritage.
Just as alarming is the high-level hatred towards Armenians by the Muslim government of Azerbaijan. Systematic destruction of Armenian monuments and Christian Armenian heritage in Azerbaijan culminated in December 2005, when the medieval Christian-Armenian cemetery in Nakhijevan’s Julfa (Republic of Azerbaijan) was completely destroyed. Released video demonstrates how Azeri Army soldiers hammer down the millennia-old Armenian historical monuments – headstones, widely known as khachqars (or “crosstones” in Armenian). After destruction, Baku has turned the Armenian cemetery into a military shooting range, thus restricting access to the area. Two consecutive U.S. Ambassadors Matthew Bryza and Richard Morningstar made unsuccessful attempts to visit the cemetery. The government of Azerbaijan declined to allow their visit. European parliament’s similar attempt was again blocked. However, Slavomir Horak, a scholar from Prague’s Charles University, was able to visit the cemetery in 2009 and found no monuments left there.
Washington-based American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) rented satellites, took high-res images of the site in 2009 and compared them with pictures that had been taken prior to the destruction. “As can be seen in the 2009 image, the appearance of additional dirt roads that traverse the cemetery and visibly smoother terrain suggest that the khachkars may have been destroyed or removed by earthmoving equipment,” said Susan Wolfinbarger, senior program associate for the Geospatial Technologies and Human Rights Project, a part of the Science and Human Rights Program. “Our analysis of the satellite evidence is consistent with that of observers on the ground who have attested to the destruction of the khachkars and the leveling of the terrain in the Julfa cemetery.”
Destruction of the Julfa cemetery is similar to the recent destruction of monuments by ISIS or earlier by Taliban. They all were instigated by a very high level of intolerance and hatred towards cultural heritage of another peoples and religions. Yet, there is a difference between those two, and that difference is the international status of perpetrators. If ISIS and the Taliban are isolated and marginalized radical groups, Azerbaijan presents itself as a recognized state and an equal member of the global community, which is expected to follow all the norms and rules of international law and civilized world. But it fails to do so. Besides, while ISIS and the Taliban did not even try to conceal their actions, Azerbaijan continues to deny the crime in Julfa, and has completely closed access to the area.
Baku’s vandalism derived from its hostility with Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh. However, nothing can justify such attitude. “There is absolutely no political or religious justification for the destruction of humanity’s cultural heritage”, says UNESCO’s statement.
Meanwhile, unlike Azerbaijan, both Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh have preserved non-Armenian heritage, including mosques and Muslim cemeteries. Karabakh authorities not only preserved, but also partially repaired several war-damaged Muslim mosques, particularly one in Shoushi. American scholar Wayne Merry, who traveled to Karabakh in 2011, later testified that he saw untouched Muslim cemeteries there. Meanwhile, the Armenian cemetery in Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, has been reportedly destroyed. The Armenian Church in Baku, although renovated, now serves as the archive department of the Department of Administration Affairs of the Presidential Administration of Azerbaijan.
Turning a blind eye, half-steps or lack of action against perpetrators creates dangerous perception that hammers and bulldozers represent useful instruments to achieve political goals and redesign history.

In some ways, writing in the life science disciplines is no different from writing in other fields. The requirements are for a clear argument or thesis, the use of evidence and original sources, content organisation, and attention to grammar, formatting, and word choice. Good writing is a reflection of a clear understanding of the subject.
However, particularly in life sciences, in the process of writing it is often helpful to formulate and solidify ideas or arguments. Like all forms of writing, written material is reworked, reorganised, edited, and rewritten before it can begin to make sense. Writing for the life sciences usually follows certain formats, conventions and styles that are recognised for each type of work. The variety of these written forms include:
‘Marketing reports’ that may give promotional or explanatory information on a new treatment, clinical study, scientific finding or methodology.
1) The Thesis: There must be a main argument. The argument must be clearly stated, and the thesis presented in an interesting way and well argued.
2) The Structure: The paper should be clearly organised so that it is easy to understand the main point/s of the paper, each section, and each paragraph. The order of the overall argument should make sense and be easy to follow. If there are multiple ideas, there must be appropriate transitions that link them.
3) Evidence and Sources: Supporting evidence must be given for each point that is made. The writing should demonstrate that the author has knowledge of the field and the subject matter. All important pieces of evidence should be included, properly attributed and the correct reference information should be properly cited.
5) The Writing Style: The style should be appropriate for the audience and the assignment. The paper should be concise, focused and to the point. The sentences should be clear, grammatically correct and free of spelling errors.

With a population of almost 40.000, Figueres is the largest city in the county of Alt Empordd. Besides being the birthplace of the famous Salvador Dali, Figueres is the hometown of other distinguished people, such as Narcis de Monturiol, the inventor of the submarine which came to be known as "ictineu" or the fish ship. This town is the marketplace of the surrounding region mostly because of its geographical location.
Being close to the French border, Figueres is one of the favorite shopping spots of French tourists, who find the diversity and quality of the city's shops very appealing. Figueres lies on the route of tourism traveling from France to the cities situated around the Gulf of Roses, and as a result has excellent communications networks and infrastructures.
Just like in Barcelona, La Rambla is the commercial centre of downtown Figueres. The riverbed of Galligans was covered in order to build this wonderful promenade and a monument in homage of Narcis de Monturiol was erected at its end. The Toy Museum of Catalonia, inaugurated in 1982, is also located along La Rambla in Figueres. You and your children will be delighted admiring thousands of toys (more than 4000 items) from different ages, some of these having belonged to famous artists. The Museum of the Emporda can also be found on La Rambla housing paintings, sculptures, and archaeological collections from different ages. Located in the Saint Peter square, the Church with the same name is also an interesting tourist attraction in Figueres, as it dates from the 12th century. The Saint Ferdinand Castle was built in the 13th century and can be found on a small hill in the outskirts of Figures. It is thought to be one of the largest military constructions with bastions built in that period of time in Europe.
The second most visited museum in Spain, after the Prado Museum in Madrid, is The Dali Theatre and Museum located in Figueres. This building is located very close to the church and used to be the Municipal Theatre. In this theatre, in 1918 Salvador Dali, among other artists, had his first ever art show and exhibited two of his paintings. In 1939, the building housing this theatre was partially damaged by the World War II. The remodeling works that would transform the venue into the Dali Theatre and Museum began in 1960. Salvador Dali, himself directed the decoration works of the building, and devoted some of his creations especially for this Figueres Museum (the Mae West Room, the Wind Palace Room, the Rainy Cadillac) .
The Museum first opened for the public in 1974 and became the second museum in the world to be devoted exclusively to Salvador Dali. In 1971, in the United States of America, the Dali Museum of Cleveland, Ohio, had been founded. The Museum houses a small private collection that had belonged to the artist, but also some of his remarkable creations including paintings, sculptures, jewelry, engravings, and drawings. In 1989, Dali died and was buried in a crypt located beneath the Museum, following his own wishes.

If you are currently on a weight-loss plan or you are planning to commence very soon, then you have made one of the best decisions you can ever make regarding your health and this is especially true if the weight-loss is done the healthy way.
Weight-loss can only be healthy and beneficial for you both on the short-term and long-term if you achieve your goal by eating a healthy balanced diet and by exercising regularly.
This way, you would not only achieve your goal but you would also maintain your new weight. Weight-loss then becomes not a “plan” but a lifestyle.
If this is the case, you can only expect positive outcomes, however because weight-loss involves getting rid of that excess fat stored in your body, there are certain changes you might notice as your weight-loss progresses.
This is not to discourage you from losing weight but rather to give you an idea of the physical changes you are likely to experience. These changes are not a cause for concern and nothing you should worry about. Of course you know that having a healthy weight is key to staying healthy and these little changes would definitely not deter you.

Whether you run a casino or simply want a piece of casino glamour at home, you’ve found the right site. SlotMachinesWholesale.com has an excellent array of quality used slot machines at excellent prices. These are the same games you’ll find in the world’s biggest casinos, from antique slot machines to the best selection is slot machines for sale.
One of the biggest trends in online gaming over the last few years is Bitcoin slots. More and more slots players are choosing casinos based solely on if they offer Bitcoin as a banking option. But what’s fueling this phenomenon? Let’s find out by looking at 3 main reasons why Bitcoin slots are so popular.
A huge headache to playing real money slots at online casinos is the banking process. First off, some casinos require extensive documentation when you’re making deposits and/or withdrawals. This is annoying because you need to scan documents and send them to casinos before they approve your banking transactions. But this isn’t the case with Bitcoin because it’s an open-source currency, meaning there’s no third-party verification required. Furthermore, Bitcoin negates having to wait days or even weeks before your cashouts are approved.
Another problem associated with other casino banking options is that you may have to pay fees. Normally, these fees are associated with withdrawals, but some casinos also charge you for credit card deposits so that they don’t have to cover the fees. This is another area where Bitcoin comes to the rescue because, due to the lack of third-party involvement, there aren’t any fees. Compare this to eWallets and other payment options, which make their money off transaction charges.
One more great reason to use Bitcoin for online slots is that you may qualify for special bonuses. Based on how casinos also like what Bitcoin offers – lack of fees, no involvement with banking – they encourage Bitcoin play through special bonuses. We’ve seen Bitcoin deposit bonuses as high as $5,000, which definitely makes this cryptocurrency worth considering.
If you want more bonus money and would like to avoid paying fees, then we suggest that you look into Bitcoin. Furthermore, you can get started pretty easily by downloading a Bitcoin app, then getting your wallet and funds.

As California legalizes pot, laws collide at US checkpoints - News & Interesting - Cultural Healing and Life
PINE VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- California legalizes marijuana for recreational use Monday, but that won't stop federal agents from seizing the drug — even in tiny amounts — on busy freeways and backcountry highways.
Marijuana possession still will be prohibited at eight Border Patrol checkpoints in California, a reminder that state and federal laws collide when it comes to pot. The U.S. government classifies marijuana as a controlled substance, like heroin and LSD.
"Prior to Jan. 1, it's going to be the same after Jan. 1, because nothing changed on our end," said Ryan Yamasaki, an assistant chief of the Border Patrol's San Diego sector. "If you're a federal law enforcement agency, you uphold federal laws."
The checkpoints, located up to 100 miles (161 kilometers) from Mexico, are considered a final line of defense against immigrants who elude agents at the border. They also have been a trap for U.S. citizens carrying drugs, even tiny bags of marijuana.
About 40 percent of pot seizures at Border Patrol checkpoints from fiscal years 2013 to 2016 were an ounce (28 grams) or less from U.S. citizens, according to a Government Accountability Office report last month. California's new law allows anyone 21 and over to carry up to an ounce.
The Border Patrol operates 34 permanent checkpoints along the Mexican border and an additional 103 "tactical" stops, typically cones and signs that appear for brief periods.
Ronald Vitiello, acting deputy commissioner of parent agency Customs and Border Protection, called drug seizures an "ancillary effect" of enforcing immigration laws. Motorists typically are released after being photographed and fingerprinted. They generally aren't charged with a crime because prosecutors consider them low priority.
The clash between state and federal marijuana laws played out on a smaller scale near the Canadian border in Washington after that state legalized marijuana in 2014. California is a far busier route for illegal crossings with many more agents.
State and federal marijuana laws have conflicted since California became the first to legalize marijuana for medical use in 1996. Next week, California will be among seven states and Washington, D.C., with legal recreational pot.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a staunch opponent of legalization, said last month that he was taking a close look at federal enforcement, suggesting a tougher stance than President Barack Obama's administration.
At highway checkpoints, Border Patrol agents look for signs of nervous drivers, like clutching steering wheels and avoiding eye contact and interrupting when passengers are asked to state citizenship. Some panicked drivers make a U-turn when they spot the checkpoint, a dead giveaway.
One recent morning on westbound Interstate 8 about 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of San Diego, an agent standing outside a booth under a large white canopy stopped drivers for a few seconds to ask their citizenship or waved them through after peering inside.
A dog discovered a marijuana stash about the size of a thumbprint inside the pickup truck of a man with Arizona license plates who was taking his elderly uncle to a hospital appointment. It would have taken up to an hour to process the arrest, so agents released him after seizing the pot and warning it was illegal.
"I didn't know that, sorry," the driver said, walking to his truck after waiting on a bench a few minutes while the dog searched.
The animal sniffed something in another car but found nothing in the seats or trunk. The apologetic driver said she smoked marijuana a week earlier, implying the odor lingered.
The Pine Valley checkpoint, amid oak- and chaparral-covered mountains on the main route from Arizona to San Diego, gets busy with drivers returning from weekend getaways but is less traveled than others.
Agents say a checkpoint on Interstate 5 between San Diego and Los Angeles can cause a 4-mile (6.4-kilometer) backup in 90 seconds during peak hours.
The government faces pushback over checkpoints. Some residents complain about delays and trespassers trying to circumvent checkpoints — some even dying from heat and exhaustion. Motorists who consider them a privacy invasion steadfastly refuse to answer questions and post their test encounters on YouTube.
Border Patrol officials insist they are effective. Without them, Vitiello said, smugglers would have open passage to cities like Phoenix and Albuquerque, New Mexico, once past the border.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1976 that agents can question people at checkpoints even without reason to believe anyone in the vehicle is in the country illegally and don't need a search warrant.
Michael Chernis, an attorney who represents people charged with marijuana crimes, believes checkpoint seizures are a waste of resources but acknowledged the government is empowered.
"The bottom line is, there's absolutely no protection against federal interaction when it comes to adult use," he said.

2 Your firm has a roster of dozens of clients. You pack your week with billable hours. You have all the work you can possibly handle. And you can't pay your bills. Why? Because you don't have cash. One of the key elements to running a successful law practice is understanding that a healthy cash flow means a healthy business. We've worked with thousands of law firms over the last eight years, learning their best practices so we could develop the practice management software they needed. I want to share important strategies I've seen help law practices keep the cash flowing. What Is (And Is Not) Cash? Even experienced business owners can get confused about what "cash" is. You might have done a million dollars of business last year, but that doesn't mean you have a million dollars in the bank. A million dollars in unpaid invoices may be a positive asset on your balance sheet, but it doesn't pay your office lease. A million dollars in unbilled invoices are worth even less than that because your clients certainly aren't going to pay invoices they haven't received. If the money isn't in your operating account, ready to be used anyway you like, then it's not cash. It may be an asset, it may have a value, but it's not liquid. Many high net worth businesses declare bankruptcy because their money is tied up in inventory or real estate or accounts receivable, and they don't have the cash to pay off their creditors. Cash does more than pay your bills. It gives you the flexibility to plan for the future, to react to changes in the industry, and to build a stronger practice. A healthy cash flow in your law firm is a powerful competitive advantage over other law firms. Small business attorney Suzanne Meehle says, "You have to know what your cash flow is, every single day, or you could lose your firm." Here are the best methods we've seen successful law firms use to take control of and improve cash flow. Know Your Finances If you have hypertension, you take your blood pressure every day. If you have diabetes, you check your blood sugar. These are important indicators that help you judge your current state of health. To judge the financial health of your practice you look at your balances. How quickly could you find out your operating account, trust account, unpaid invoice and unbilled invoice balances? More importantly, how long has it been since you looked at those key figures? Check those balances every day to give yourself a quick picture of your firm's finances. If something looks out of whack, then investigate and take action. Unpaid invoice balance getting high? You need to get more aggressive about collecting on aging accounts. Trust account balance falling? It's time to send out retainer replenishment requests. You can't take action until you can spot the problems. Ideally you want all key indicators on a single dashboard screen so you don't have to hunt all over. Top Cash Flow Management Strategies CosmoLex Cloud, LLC 2
3 Evergreen Retainers People don't like paying their attorneys, especially if the case is decided unfavorably. However non-payment is not a valid reason to drop a client in an ongoing matter. This is why attorneys typically collect an evergreen retainer, also known as a security retainer. The client provides the money up front so the law firm can take payments out of the escrow as money is earned. Unfortunately many law firms get the initial retainer but don't follow up. The retainer runs out and now you are billing for charges you've already incurred. Weeks pass and your operating account gets lower and lower. You need an application that will notify you when the retainer balance on a given matter gets low so you can send out retainer replenishment requests before the money runs out. You take action before there is a problem rather than reacting afterwards. Integrated Retainer and Billing Tools Evergreen retainers are so important to healthy cash flow that they deserve two mentions in this paper. Not only is it important to keep the balances high, it's important to know when to use them. Remember that retainers are trust funds. That means that, even though you have that money in your account, you can't spend it until you've earned it. However once you have earned it, you can transfer that money into your operating account to cover client invoices. This is why you need to be using a billing system that includes retainer management. They simply are not separate tasks. You need to know a matter's retainer balance, whether or not it will cover an invoice, how much of it is in your trust account and how much is in your operating account, and so much more. Effective retainer management lets you get paid instantly. Expense Tracking Whether you work on retainer, invoice the client monthly, or get your payments from a contingency settlement, you still pay for your own expenses first and try to get reimbursed later. Regardless of your billing model you can't get reimbursed for expenses you don't claim. Law practices often find "expense leakage" cripples their cash flows. The problem is that not every expense gets documented in the appropriate matter so it never gets billed and you end up giving the client some unintentional pro bono service. It is essential you have a system that allows you to document every expense you incur on a case, preferably at the time the money is laid out. Otherwise lost receipts, bad memory and sloppy bookkeeping can cost your firm an enormous chunk of income. Top Cash Flow Management Strategies CosmoLex Cloud, LLC 3
4 Billable Hour Tracking Just as you can't collect on unbilled expenses, you can't bill on unclaimed time. Everyone in your firm, from clerks to senior attorneys, should be documenting billable hours every day. Don't try to recreate your schedule from memory. You will not only inevitably forget about certain hours, but you could unintentionally overbill a client and end up facing an ethics complaint. A senior member of staff should look over all timekeepers in the firm. Is everyone pitching in appropriately? If someone consistently bills fewer or more hours than everyone else, then that bears further investigation. It's also important to correlate each person's completed task list with the billable hours. Is each task getting billed, or is there leakage here as well? Timely Invoices Even the most honest clients aren't going to pay if they don't get billed. You should routinely send out invoices at least monthly. For cases that are over quickly, you should bill immediately rather than waiting for the next billing cycle. If you wait to bill, you can expect the client to wait to pay. Every day you are unpaid is an interest-free loan to your clients. Make sure your invoices are clean and easy to read. If they are littered with jargon, over-detailed expense reports and confusing lists of figures, then they aren't going to get paid. Clients will put them aside until they can call and ask questions. Uncluttered invoices get paid faster, and faster payment is better cash flow. Pursue Aging Accounts Take one sixth of the cash in your wallet and throw it away right now. No? You think that's crazy? Well, according to the Center for the Study of the Legal Profession at Georgetown Law, attorneys collect only 84% of what they earn so that's what most law firms are doing anyhow. A large part of the problem is attorneys don't like to dun delinquent clients. You've built a personal relationship with this person and you don't want to be the bad guy. You don't have to be. Clients may just need a reminder. Or maybe they are suffering some temporary financial setback. You can be sympathetic, while still reminding them of their obligation. Or maybe you can work out a mutually beneficial payment plan. Polite follow ups to unpaid invoices greatly increases your collection rate and your cash flow.

5 Moving Into The Cloud In nearly every method I've mentioned above, timeliness is essential. The sooner you complete a task, the sooner you get paid, and the sooner cash flows into your practice. Using cloud-based legal billing software enhances every one of these suggestions. For example: Enter billable hours and expenses as soon as you incur them, even if you are away from the office. Answer client questions about an invoice no matter where you when the client talks to you. Issue invoices, retainer replenishment requests and late payment reminders as needed rather than having to wait until you are back at your desktop computer. The flexibility to monitor and administer your practice's cash flow at your convenience is a powerful financial management tool. You take control and build a healthier, more financially stable practice. Use The Right Tools These philosophies reflect not only how I have run my businesses, but how we at CosmoLex have developed our practice management software. We set out to create a tool that would give attorneys the ability to manage their practices more effectively and with less effort than when using other software packages. However none of this advice requires CosmoLex or any other billing software. Even if you are still working with old-fashioned manual bookkeeping methods you can still adopt these changes to build a better law firm. But seriously -- it's the 21st Century. Use law practice management software. The most important advice to get out of this article is that you have to take an active role in managing your practice's finances. You will actually end up spending less time on administrative tasks than if you just react to emergencies, and you will have a more reliable cash flow to secure your law firm's future.

I’ve gotten to see and experience the most interesting things during the course of this trip. Some examples follow.
» I got to spend some time with the first ever open lesbian couple I’ve known. Though they are intelligent and funny and fun to hang out with, this is not nearly as exciting or interesting as porn might make it seem. Speaking of porn, apparently there are courses for such.
» I got to handle a bagpipe. Now I, personally, can play a few other instruments, but this one is hard as hell to get going. This wasn’t just any bagpipe either, this bagpipe was played for the queen.
» I got to stay at a hotel metres away from one of the blasts, just 3 days before said blasts. Of course, I often took the “route with the blast” on the way to and from said hotel. It’s quite humbling to see the same areas reduced to rubble. (There are no pictures of the devastation, because each time I walk up to the area and try to take out my camera, my stomach knots up.)
» I got to see (really rowdy) riots—as in people protesting to have their voices heard during the course of the G8 summit. I saw numerous shops and such boarded up to minimize vandalism as the mobs walked past.
I did scream along with them for a while, as some of the stuff they were fighting for really was worthwhile (but they didn’t seem old or smart enough to realize it),
» I got to spend a couple of days at what is probably the toughest city in the world, Glasgow. Forget New York, this is where it’s at — if you fancy getting arbitrarily mugged. There is no concept of “bad neighbourhoods” and “good neighbourhoods”, it’s all bad. This is one place I will never ever return to, ever.
» I got to roam around Trinity college, in Oxford, where the likes of Isaac Newton worked. That was pretty humbling too. But being asked by the guide, “Are you a scientist? In my 20 years of doing this, no one’s ever asked me this sort of stuff before” felt good. I’m a “scientist”, yay.
This is a printer-friendly version of the journal entry “Sights, sounds and smells – 1 (of 3?)” from actuality.log. Visit http://emphaticallystatic.org/earlier/sights-sounds-and-smells-1-of-3/ to read the original entry and follow any responses to it.
20? Hey, at what point did I mention anything of that sort? I’m an aged old man (aka 24). What I wouldn’t give to be a kid again. All I said was that the guide was doing her thing for 20 years.
And I’ve been meaning to ask, and your current nickname makes it seem like the perfect time. You have a pretty name, what’s with the insistence on using different pseudonyms or anonymity on posting? Do you really like using different names?

I use the shampoo and conditioner from the Elastic Hydration line, and the Wakame serum, and I am quite frankly satisfied with its benefits and results. I must point out that I haven’t tried The Ritual yet, but I have heard wonderful things about it and I want to experience it first hand before daring to give reviews (no matter how good they may be) from third parties. The quality of their formulations should means it’d be a very beneficial and full-on sensory experience for my hair.
When you’re away on holiday, you want everything to be easy and simply don’t you? It’s a break for the family, time to get away and time to relax, so sometimes you just want a real break from everything you do at home. This can put some people off wanting to be anywhere near shops when they are away on holiday, however being near shops really can be very useful - it’s not like you will be spending much time in them anyway, unless you really want to!
The above scene shows a main road in Chipping Norton in the Cotswolds. Rent a holiday cottage in the Cotswolds, in a village, and the chances are that there will be a few essential shops within walking distance. The Cotswolds are considered one of the loveliest and most affluent rural destinations in England, favoured by royalty and steeped in history.
Being near a small local shop when you’re on holiday is really useful for obvious reasons. It allows you to get fresh food whenever you want it and just has all those little items that you might have forgotten you needed to pack for going away. It is really convenient just to know that this shop is there in case you forget anything, allowing you to relax more, knowing that anything that you want is nearby.
When you’re on holiday, you don’t want to be trekking off to get food every day, so having a shop nearby helps to prevent this. A holiday is meant to be blissful, relaxing and fun - different from everyday, but if you have to go on a long journey to the shops just to pick up a few bits of food, this is hardly the case. You may think that because you’re on holiday, you want to be away from shops, but trust me, if you decide to do that, you will regret it.
Having shops nearby when you are away on holiday means that you don’t have to spend hours pouring over a map trying to work out where the nearest shops are. It prevents you from getting lost when you go looking for them and stops you wasting your day shop hunting when you really should be spending your valuable holiday time doing far more fun things. It also means that you don’t have to be as prepared before you go away on holiday as you don’t have to have all your meals planned out, cooked and then frozen, being able to be more spontaneous with what you decide to cook as you can simply go and get what you want without much trouble or effort.
Not only is it convenient to be near shops for food, but being near them means that you can pick up any souvenirs and gifts you want really easily and quickly. You can peruse the shops at your leisure, and, if they are nearby, you don’t have to worry about having to leave early because you have a few hours car journey to get back to your cottage. If you are close to a little village with shops, this can be really nice on holiday as it could mean that you have shops, restaurants and pubs all in one place, really giving you a taste of country village life and a chance to look at the quirky and kitsch items independent stores sell.
Having shops nearby is really useful for any holiday maker. Whether you use them or not, the security of having them there can really help to make you relax more, and after all, you’re away on holiday - it should all be about relaxing.
Stay in a holiday cottage with a swimming pool, or cottage with a hot tub, or a cottage with a games room for a fabulous self-catering break in Britain or Ireland.

Gasoline - Gasoline is what most of our cars came setup so it's usually what we stick with. Gasoline is a mixture of hydrocarbons. The petroleum distillate fraction termed "gasoline" contains mostly saturated hydrocarbons usually with a chemical formula of C8H18. The air fuel ratio, A/F Ratio, for complete combustion is 14.7:1, stoichiometric. The A/F ratio for maximum power is approximately 12.5:1 - 12.8:1. This means that our engine at max power, 12.8:1, consumes 12.8 pounds of air for 1 pound of fuel. Gasoline has approximately 18,400 BTU/lb . Using the air flow calculator with the default inputs we get our 355 SBC consumes 567.53 cfm @ 6500rpm which is 42.64 pounds of air and consumes 2.89 pounds of fuel. Therefore if we are using gasoline our engine is producing 53,176 BTU's of energy at 6500 rpm.
Alcohol (Methanol) - Alcohol is usually used in the form of Methyl alcohol or methanol. CH3OH is the chemical formula. Methanol burns at a much richer mixture than gasoline does, between 5.0:1 - 6.0:1. That's 5 lbs of air to one pound of fuel. Methanol has approximately 9,500 BTU/lb. Using our 355, example above, SBC consumes 567.53 cfm @ 6500rpm which is 42.64 pounds of air and now at 6.0:1 ratio for Methanol is 7.11 pounds of fuel. Therefore if we are using Methanol fuel our engine is producing 67,545 BTU's of energy at 6500 rpm.
Nitromethane - is a fuel that is used mostly in specialized drag racing classes, "nitro funny cars" and "top fuel". Nitromethane's chemical formula is CH3NO2. The oxygen in nitromethane's molecular structure means that nitromethane does not need as much atmospheric oxygen to burn, part of the oxygen needed to burn nitromethane is carried in the fuel itself. Typical A/F ratio for nitromethane is 1.7:1 and nitromethane has an energy content of 5,000 BTU/lb. Using our 355, example above, SBC consumes 567.53 cfm @ 6500rpm which is 42.64 pounds of air and now at 1.7:1 ratio for nitromethane is 25.08 pounds of fuel. Therefore if we are using Nitromethane fuel our engine is producing 125,412 BTU's of energy at 6500 rpm.
Summary - As you can the clear winner is nitromethane. But that doesn't mean to go out and pour nitromethane in your car and see how it runs, if you do your engine will surely blow up. Nitromethane is very expensive and dangerous to handle. The interesting alternative to gasoline is Methanol. Methanol will make more power, typically around 20% more power than a similar engine running gasoline. Some things to consider in running methanol is your fuel system will have to be completely changed / upgraded. Based on the table above the fuel system will have to flow approximately 2.5 times as much as the gasoline engine.
Nitromethane is used as a fuel in drag racing to provide more power than would be available with gasoline or with alcohol. When you hear the term "nitro funny car" or "top fuel dragster", that means that the engine burns nitromethane. The chemical formula for nitromethane is CH3NO2. For comparison, a typical gasoline molecule is C8H18. Nitro thus can be seen to have oxygen as part of its' chemical composition while gasoline does not. The oxygen content of nitromethane means that not as much atmospheric oxygen is needed for combustion, part of the oxygen needed to burn nitromethane is carried in the fuel itself.
Due to the high oxygen content, while 14.6 pounds of air are needed to burn a pound of gasoline, only 1.7 pounds of air are needed per pound of nitromethane. A motor can only take in so much air on each stoke, and with that amount of air you can burn 8.7 times more nitromethane than gasoline. The energy content of gasoline is ~18,000 BTU/pound while nitro has ~5,000 BTU/pound. By pumping in 8.7 times as much nitromethane per stroke, you get about 2.5 times more power per stroke.
The speed of combustion for nitromethane is much less than for gasoline, meaning that there is not enough time to burn all the nitromethane in the cylinder when the engine is running at high RPM. When the exhaust valve opens, nitromethane that is still burning flows out through the exhaust pipe. That is why funny cars and dragsters have visible yellow flames from their exhaust pipes.

After a great bivy at the lovely Lyall Tarn, Wietse and I awoke at around 06:00 to an extremely windy, cloudy and dark sky beneath the brooding rock walls of Mount Lyall. We both commented on the quality of our sleep - the night was very calm and quite warm for September and we both got over 9 hours of shut-eye. Just as forecasted on SpotWX, the wind picked up fiercely in the early morning hours, and by 06:15 we were feeling rain drops outside the tent. Darn it. I seem to be getting a lot of rain on my trips in 2018!! I can only remember packing up a few dry camps this year and I've spent a lot of nights under the sky, as usual. If it's not raining I seem to get screwed over by a heavy dew. The smattering of rain drops soon became a proper downpour and we dove back into the tent where we ate breakfast and enjoyed a hot coffee while wondering if we'd even get to do our planned scramble up Mount Gass this day. Phil's decision to return to the comfort of his house the day before was starting to look like a brilliant move on his part!
!!Attention!! explor8ion.com is being updated and trip reports migrated to a new site while this one is still operational.

My name is Vern Dewit. I moved to Calgary, Alberta (Canada) in 1999 and since then I've fallen in love with the spectacular scenery and grand vistas that open up as you scramble up above treeline on a beautiful fall morning, or make your first cast on some back country stream as the sun throws its golden warmth on surrounding peaks.
I hope that my trip reports and pictures will inspire you to push your own physical limits whatever those may be. You may be inspired to try scrambling - a sport where you climb mountains via non-technical ascent routes - or you may simply realize what's in your own backyard and go for a short hike somewhere.
Read the trip reports carefully and don't simply follow them blindly. Make sure you're within your abilities and if you have any questions don't hesitate to send me an email.

This link wraps the convolution_nd() function and holds the filter weight and bias vector as parameters.
in_channels (int) – Number of channels of input arrays. If None, parameter initialization will be deferred until the first forward data pass at which time the size will be determined.
initialW (initializer) – Initializer to initialize the weight. When it is numpy.ndarray, its ndim should be \(n+2\) where \(n\) is the number of spatial dimensions.
cover_all (bool) – If True, all spatial locations are convoluted into some output pixels. It may make the output size larger. cover_all needs to be False if you want to use cuDNN.
dilate (int or tuple of int s) – Dilation factor of filter applications. dilate=d and dilate=(d, d, ..., d) are equivalent.
groups (int) – The number of groups to use grouped convolution. The default is one, where grouped convolution is not used.
initializer – If it is not None, the data is initialized with the given initializer. If it is an array, the data is directly initialized by it. If it is callable, it is used as a weight initializer. Note that in these cases, dtype argument is ignored.
The registered value is saved and loaded on serialization and deserialization. The value is set to an attribute of the link.
This method adds each gradient array of the given link to corresponding gradient array of this link. The accumulation is even done across host and different devices.
This method should be called before the backward computation at every iteration of the optimization.
The whole hierarchy rooted by this link is copied. There are three modes to perform copy. Please see the documentation for the argument mode below.
mode (str) – It should be either init, copy, or share. init means parameter variables under the returned link object is re-initialized by calling their initialize() method, so that all the parameters may have different initial values from the original link. copy means that the link object is deeply copied, so that its parameters are not re-initialized but are also deeply copied. Thus, all parameters have same initial values but can be changed independently. share means that the link is shallowly copied, so that its parameters’ arrays are shared with the original one. Thus, their values are changed synchronously. The default mode is share.
This method copies data arrays of all parameters in the hierarchy. The copy is even done across the host and devices. Note that this method does not copy the gradient arrays.
This method counts the total number of scalar values included in all the Parameters held by this link and its descendants.
This is a convenient method to register an existing attribute as a persistent value. If name has been already registered as a parameter, this method removes it from the list of parameter names and re-registers it as a persistent value.
This method returns a Sequential object which has the same Link multiple times repeatedly. The mode argument means how to copy this link to repeat.
The net object contains 16 blocks, each of which is ConvBNReLU. And the mode was init, so each block is re-initialized with different parameters. If you give copy to this argument, each block has same values for its parameters but its object ID is different from others. If it is share, each block is same to others in terms of not only parameters but also the object IDs because they are shallow-copied, so that when the parameter of one block is changed, all the parameters in the others also change.
mode (str) – It should be either init, copy, or share. init means parameters of each repeated element in the returned Sequential will be re-initialized, so that all elements have different initial parameters. copy means that the parameters will not be re-initialized but object itself will be deep-copied, so that all elements have same initial parameters but can be changed independently. share means all the elements which consist the resulting Sequential object are same object because they are shallow-copied, so that all parameters of elements are shared with each other.
This method does not handle non-registered attributes. If some of such attributes must be copied to CPU, the link implementation must override this method to do so.
This method does not handle non-registered attributes. If some of such attributes must be copied to GPU, the link implementation must override this method to do so.
This method can be used for the same purpose of cleargrads, but less efficient. This method is left for backward compatibility.
Contrary to chainer.thread_local.link_hooks, which registers its elements to all functions, link hooks in this property are specific to this link.
The BCC has criticised David Cameron’s plans to transform the apprenticeship sector, stating that by encouraging SMEs to hire more apprentices, he is making them ‘‘jump through hoops’’ to please the public sector.
In late August, Prime Minister David Cameron outlined his plans to create 3 million apprenticeships by 2020.
One of the measures that is to be put in place is a new requirement to take into account apprenticeship schemes when awarding businesses with large government accounts (contracts worth over £10m). Employers’ bids will be reviewed in line with best practice for the number of apprentices that they expect to support.
Cameron explained his thinking behind the rule, stating that employers should be investing more in their workforce.
‘‘The greatest asset any employer has is their workforce. And by investing in them, they are investing in the success and future of their business.’’
The plans have already been criticised by a number of industry bodies, including the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which stated that quality shouldn’t be sacrificed for quantity when trying to improve the apprenticeship sector.
‘‘While we did not support the introduction of a levy, the key thing now is that the apprenticeships it delivers meet business demand and give young people routes to great careers and higher pay,’’ said a CBI statement.
The BCC shares the CBI’s viewpoint. Adam Marshall, executive director of policy and external affairs at the British Chambers of Commerce has made his feelings clear regarding the government contract rule, stating that it would in fact add to the red tape that Cameron hopes to reduce.
‘‘Everyone wants to see more high quality apprenticeship places being created but adding red tape and bureaucracy to government procurement opportunities isn’t the way to make it happen,’’ stated Marshall.
Marshall then moved on to the subject of SMEs, stating that small and medium sized businesses could suffer from the legal change.
‘‘Small and medium size businesses in particular would view this as yet another hoop they have to jump through in the already complex world of doing business with the public sector.’’
‘‘Businesses up and down Britain agree that the best way to increase the number of apprenticeships is to focus relentlessly on their quality, and by ensuring that they are viewed as positively as academic qualifications by employers.’’
The purpose of 'Suicide Kawaii' was to reflect a fictional personality through a collection of objects. The objects collected resemble offerings to a dark shrine, like the LED candles and chunks of quartz crystals. Other objects could also be utilized as tools of self-mutilation, like a modified disposable razor and utility blades. The objects are mysterious and yet innocent. The small cabined is bound by colorful rubber bands and abandoned in the woods.

We are getting through – somehow – the third week of everybody having some godawful virus, and it seems that the girls are starting to feel better. We know this not because of the fact that their fevers are disappearing or because they are coughing less or need their noses wiped less. No, it’s because they are letting their talents drift more toward the zone of experimental mischief.
Here, Daddy is delighted that they now seem to love yogurt for lunch and are proudly feeding themselves like Big Girls. Look, G even finished off one cup and asked politely for another. Such good girls! Proud Daddy’s just going to go around the corner for a minute to put some dishes away…
Stupid Daddy’s just going to kick himself for forgetting how much these girls like to put things on their heads.
Note how G thought it best to remove her bib before conducting this experiment. Well, after lunch we all got our heads rinsed off in the kitchen sink. Which – go figure – they both really enjoyed. Went dancing off to naps like they just won a pony. Thanks, Yoplait!
Hoping to avoid the stress of last year’s Xmas card, we decided to start early and try to get a great photo of the girls together. What is that saying? Man plans, and God laughs? Someone was definitely laughing.
It was a gorgeous fall day, and probably the last time the girls would be wearing shorts, so we threw clean t-shirts on them and headed to the park with a camera.
July was an amazing month for both of our sparrows, for all sorts of reasons, and we saw some huge changes in them from the beginning of the month to the end. Starting with, our babies are officially gone, and in their place, we have toddlers. Toddlers who recently developed the ability to throw tantrums, which is adorable and funny, but also toddlers who play together more and more. Often, they can go nearly 3 minutes playing together, before one of them hauls off and hits the other one in the face, or yanks out a fistful of hair, or picks up the toy and throws it as far away as possible.
It was a big month for M. We have watched her getting up on her knees for awhile now, but she wasn’t pulling up to her feet at all, until suddenly one day, she just crawled over to Daddy, and planted her feet on the ground, used his belly as leverage, and stood up. She is getting progressively stronger every day as she practices this new skill, and as you can imagine, she is very proud of herself and her new ability. If she could speak, you know she would yell, ‘TA-DA!” every time she pulled herself to her feet.
G had a big month as well. Despite the fact that we had never held her hands and encouraged her to walk in any way, she decided one day that she could do it, and in much the same way as she taught herself to stand up, she taught herself to walk. Which makes this parenting gig a pretty easy one, given that she is so DIY about learning these things! She is a funny kid, and she loves to ‘cruise’ around the room, which has led us to the realization that there is no uglier decor than ‘babyproofing’. We set up a track around the perimeter of the living room – rubbermaid bins weighed down with books, the coffee table, pushed back against the wall, the couches moved, the TV baby-gated off, etc – and she loves it, traveling in circles, holding on with one hand and holding a book in the other, but you won’t be seeing us featured in House Beautiful any time soon. She is also walking farther and farther without holding on to anything – 6 or 7 steps at a time. We fear her.
M demonstrates her great love and respect of literature. Our kids get a lot of fibre in their diet, mostly from boardbooks.
And of course, we are still in LOVE with ELMO! Elmo comes on, and they both run to the TV, stand up, and hang on the babygate, as enraptured as groupies at a concert. Check out G’s saggy bum – all their pants slide down off of them, due to ridiculous skinnyness.
G cut a giant molar this month, and if you ask her, she will point to it. Sort of. They love their teeth.
This month, we discovered the wonders of steamed broccoli. That child’s grin is the direct result of being given broccoli, and she could happily live on broccoli and sharp cheddar cheese. Such a dainty eater!
Sadly, this month is not without its share of tragedy. Early in July, the entire frozen north ran out of wine, forcing our innuit relatives to make their (nearly sober!) way south. As everyone knows, Chicago is the wine capital of the world, and so they landed here. Sadly, the grandparent to accordion ratio is still deeply lacking, however they made up for it by pretending to the kids that they know how to read.
Brian is such a good son-in-law – you know he photoshopped that book so that it is right-side-up in the photos, so as not to embarrass grandma, who was ‘reading’ to the kids. Notice grandad, holding on to the back of that couch for dear life – it didn’t stop ‘the spins’ in college, and it doesn’t stop them now, but you know, we are always an optimistic family.
There were other firsts as well. M finally got to meet her great-aunt. We call her G4 here on this site, but she is more formally known as Mrs. David Yurman.
Many people think M was named after her great aunt, but she is in fact named after a boat. Sorry, Mrs. David Yurman!
We wish we could put the photoshopped version of this photo online – the one where they look like the Blagovitch family xmas card, but you know these two would shiv you in your sleep if you cross them.
When family comes to visit, you find out what they really think of you. Apparently, my family thinks I am a gay gladiator.
Since the kids’ birthday was canceled due to sickness, we waited to open some of their presents until at least some family sobered up and headed south, which obviously meant waiting a few weeks. But it was worth it, because, seriously, how cute are these pigs? Love, love, love them.
Also, family, the next time we have a reunion, it would be in everyone’s best interest if we set aside an afternoon so that our cousins Jeff and Sue could teach us all a little something about shipping a package, because these, which are very fragile, were so expertly packed that the box was like a work of art. And I don’t want to name any names here (ahem, but perhaps you, the one who sent us coffee mugs once, in a shoebox, without one bit of padding or packing material) should bring a pad of paper and a pen to that workshop and let Sue walk you through how to do it properly.
It had to happen eventually – we ran out of wine, and simultaneously, everyone had to leave immediately for some very important business elsewhere, leaving us with what we like to call, CSI: MY BUNNY. Doesn’t it look like a very cute crime scene here?
Its hard to explain what is going on here. I think B is practicing his marsupial parenting skills. I don’t know – that baby loves it, and that’s all that matters!
This is the month we realized that it is nearly impossible to take a photo of the two of them together. No one ever, EVER looks at the camera at the same time.
But we do get a lot of great candids. This is how both girls spend a lot of their time – flopped out on our big floor pillows, reading. And they do read – they babble while they turn the pages, which is hilarious, because sometimes they do it with the same inflections we use when we read to them. And 5 little monkeys are a Big Deal around here.
We used to have babies, and now we have toddlers – our big girls this week, collars popped like extras in a John Hughes movie.
This was also the month that language skills exploded. And by exploded, we mean the girls are starting to use words, 2 of which sound vaguely like English, and two of which they just made up. By far, the most specific word they have is “Ow-WOW”, which is the dog. And is what the dog sounds like. “Da-Da” is Daddy,but also what you say to get someone’s attention, and is sometimes also Jack and the cats. “Ma-Ma” is what you yell when nobody responds to “Da-Da” and is usually heard when two little girls decide they don’t actually want to take a nap and perhaps somebody ought to come in this room right now and get us out of these cribs.
And finally, a little video for cousin Jim. Because the kids got teeth early, they started brushing those teeth early, and its the craziest thing, ever. You can take food away from them, toys, anything. But you cannot take a toothbrush away, even if, like in this video,they have been brushing for about 20 minutes. Its the biggest fight, getting those brushes back, and you know, it doesn’t take 20 minutes to brush nine teeth. But its like toothbrushes are made of Elmo, the love they have of them.
We probably should have realized that going to the pediatrician on Good Friday was a bad idea, because the only other patients there were carrying the plague. So, Easter turned out a whole lot more low key than expected this year, but we spent a quiet weekend, all four of us, and I think we are on the mend.
Now that we have done it once, we know what to do, and even our first attempts are really pretty. If I could actually function without Dayquil, I would have put these in a glass vase.
Then, we dressed the kids up – just to take pictures, mind you – and then put them back in their jammies, because they are sick and need their rest. If everyone wore underpants this cute, there would be no wars. You know its true.
Thank GOD! After a million failed attempts, one decent picture of both kids, and we can call it a day and go back to bed!
Although he is no match for a good Barnyard Dance. These books are so funny – we read them to the girls, and at some point, they grab them from us and start achewing on them. And sometimes they open the books up, look at the pictures, and babble. Imitating us? Maybe.
We credit her lovely skin to the numerous oatmeal masques she applies – one each morning, all by herself!
Its a drafty winter in Chicago. Luckily, we have lots of blankets to snuggle on! These were made by aunt Prudie, and see a lot of use during our morning Jane Fonda workouts with the sparrows.
Nothing is more fun than two babies in diapers, both on antibiotics, and being in our 4th month of not owning a washer and dryer, thanks to our awesome, awesome house fire drama. Not that we need a washer, because clearly, our family is the cleanest on the block.
Dinner time is for chillaxin’. Just kickin’ back, droppin’ our Gs, and hangin’ out. Ironically, just above her chair, on the bookshelves, are an entire shelf of books by etiquette mavens, including Emily Post’s Blue Book, The Amy Vanderbilt Guide, and some Miss Manners, along with a great run of arcane etiquette manuals from the 19th and early 20th centuries. And NONE of them advocate sitting with your foot up on the dinner table!
Some days, they don’t even make it to the high chairs, and fall asleep while bottle-feeding. They don’t stop eating, even after they fall asleep, which is pretty adorable.
When she pledges Theta and her pledge Educator writes me and asks for a cute baby picture of her for big sister/little sister match up games, I am sending this one. She fell asleep while eating, and still finished the bottle. That’s some serious talent.
But we do make it to the high chairs at least a few times a day, and eating is a very …. tactile … experience. Luckily, this is oatmeal, so you know its great on the skin as a masque.
Check out the ‘blowback’ on these high chair covers. This was a GREAT meal! Luckily, we have spare covers, because these ladies are very artistically inclined when it comes to eating.
And when you get that messy, somebody has to clean you up afterward. Luckily, the Three Stooges often stop by for a wipe up.
The last two days were rough – lots of medical stuff, lots of general ick – and we are all a little tired, in part because two little people, who shall not be named, refused to nap this afternoon, choosing instead to stay up play. But it was worth skipping the nap today, because we saw something we haven’t really seen much before. The kids play a little together, but mostly play side by side, independent of each other, until some hairpulling starts, or they grab toys from each other, but aren’t particularly engaged. But today, as we held them on our laps, they started having a little conversation with each other. A conversation so side-splittingly funny that both of them were gasping for breath, they were laughing so hard. At each other. The conversation continued on the floor…
M was laughing so hard at one point we were afraid she might throw up. We have never heard her laugh like this before.
G has a strong interest in feeding herself, and as it turns out, prune puree is really messy. Who knew?
Clearly, larger bibs are the way to go, and luckily, the ladies have a friend in North Carolina who knew exactly what they needed!

What caused the Big Bang and created the Universe? (Beginner) - Curious About Astronomy? Ask an Astronomer
Science deals with testable hypotheses, i.e. ideas that are falsifiable through prediction and experiment. As it is only possible to interact with the contents of the Universe, it is essentially impossible to ask a scientific question about what is external to the Universe, whether spatially or temporally (assuming either is even possible).
It is possible that if there are additional dimensions and mutliple universes that interact with the 4 traditional dimensions, then we may eventually be able to learn of things that were once external to the Universe. However, such ideas are currently not testable and so might be classified as applied mathematics rather than science.
In short, questions about events that were before or outside the Universe are not currently scientific questions, and likely never will be.
Mike is a fourth year astronomy graduate student at Cornell, where he works with Professors Martha Haynes and Riccardo Giovanelli on the ALFALFA survey, a blind survey of gas-rich galaxies in the local Universe carried out with the 305m Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico.
When we look back to the Big Bang, why don't we see the universe as a tiny speck of matter? (Intermediate)
Semacon's S-120 and S-140 model Coin Counter feature our "push button control panel". These "push burton" controls provide functions that are typically used most often by the operator. Push button controls are much more durable and reliable than the membrane style control panels found on other coin counters. Compare our easy to use control panel to other brands and you will understand another reason why Semacon is a step above the competition.
The Semacon Coin Counter is designed to quietly count and wrap or bag coins in a very high speed manner. These models feature an offsort function which is designed to count and optionally package the largest diameter coin first and separate the smaller diameter coins into a different bag or tray. This process is then repeated until all coin denominations have been counted and optionally packaged.
The bottom line... Semacon coin counters will save you time so you will have more time to do other things!
The S-120 & S-140 Semacon Coin Counter features one simple adjustment for the coin's diameter and another easy adjustment to set the coin's thickness. Simplicity at its best!
Our S-120 & S-140 models operate automatically for the ultimate in high speed counting & sorting. The electronic counting system provides an easy selection of variable bagging and packaging stop points via the control panel.
Both the S-120 and S-140 feature a metal chassis and heavy duty components that are designed to withstand the heavy use commonly found in commercial counting applications.
Our S-120 model is portable in design for easy transportation to multiple loca¬tions or for simply storing the machine away when it's not in use. When open, the S-120's lid acts as an inspection tray for feeding coins into the coin hopper. When closed, it protects the control panel and hopper and the unit can then be transported using the built-in carrying handle.

Semacon's S-120, S-130 and S-140 Coin Counters feature convenient coin packaging capabilities. Coin packaging tubes are available as an option for wrapping the following denominations: 1¢ - 5¢ - 10¢ - 25¢ 50¢ - $1.00 (Golden/SBA)
These counters are capable of processing coins at ultra-high speeds, yet are quieter than many other coin counters.

From buying at the right time to choosing colors, here's what you need to find furniture that lasts, and save time and cash while you're at it.
Wood furniture falls into three categories: solid wood, veneers, and particle board or composite wood.
Solid wood furniture is typically more expensive than other types and looks great, but can be susceptible to scratches and water rings. Veneers have an inexpensive wood base covered by several thin layers of better-quality wood. Because of the cheaper core, veneers aren’t as expensive as solid wood pieces. Particle board and composite wood pieces are made from a combination of wood pulp, plastics, and resin, basically the scraps of the furniture world. These are the cheapest type of wood furniture and can look decent, but won’t hold up for decades.
Open the drawers and cabinets. Make sure the drawer pulls all the way out, latches properly, and then shuts evenly. Make sure doors open, remain in an open position (instead of snapping closed while you’re trying to get something out of the cabinet), and shut again. Check the handles and knobs. They should fit tightly and not jiggle or turn.
Look for wood joined at ends and corners, not glued or nailed in. Known in the manufacturing world as wood joinery, these pieces are studier and can take more weight. Check out Basic Woodworking Joints from Wood Magazine to see examples.
Let your lifestyle determine what colors and fabrics you choose. For example, I have a large, hyper dog constantly climbing on the furniture. If I brought home a white suede couch, it would be torn apart and stained in minutes. If you have kids or pets, stick with dark colors and stain-resistant tough fabrics like linen or tweed.
I once bought an orange corduroy armchair at a furniture outlet store. At the time, my house was decorated in orange, blue, and white, and I thought I’d love those colors forever. As it turned out, “forever” was about a year. I got so sick of the bright orange I sold the chair for a fraction of what I paid. Learn from my mistake: Stick to neutral colors for your bigger and more expensive pieces. Save bold colors for décor pieces.
The legs should be heavy, wood, and jointed to the frame of the sofa or chair, not nailed. Plastic, rubber, or metal legs don’t look as nice, can tear up your floors, and won’t hold up as well. Same goes for nailed-in wood legs. If you’re spending more than $1,000 on a sofa, look for one with a fifth leg in the middle. They provide extra support – you won’t find them on many cheaper sofas.
If you like firm sofas, look for one with traditional coiled springs. If you want a softer feel, go with zigzag coils. Before you buy, take off the cushions and press down on the base of the sofa. The coils should push down and spring back into place immediately.
Look for firm cushions with a removable cover matching on both sides. Firm cushions hold up better over time. Fully covered cushions cost a bit more than ones with the pattern on one side and a plain white or tan backing, but they’ll last longer and wear evenly if you can flip them over every few months. Find removable covers that are easily washable.
Love this Dean 3 Drawer Nightstand! It fits perfectly in our house. The Dean 3 Drawer Nightstand was great! It was everything I expected plus more. I love the color and the style so I kept it. Beautiful, looks just like picture, good quality product for price, packaged well and easy to assemble, would definitely recommend.
It is beautiful Dean 3 Drawer Nightstand, and it is so comfortable it matches to all the furniture i have gotten. The color is exactly how it looks at the pictures. Delivery service was awesome. The men wore protective covering on shoes when entering the house. Love it!!! I think it is great for the money.
Delivery for this sectional took about 2 weeks, which was faster than most reviews. The Dean 3 Drawer Nightstand itself was extremely easy to put together... no tools required and took me 30 min to set up. All in all I think it was a good purchase.

This mid-size evergreen tree was blown over by the wind but it didn't break - the trunk bent to a 90 degree angle. Odd!
The wind is powerful. We've not had a tree come down yet in our yard, but here's some wind damage. I don't know exactly when this damage happened. Our winter has been very mild this year (happy!) but in its place there's been some doozy storms. WoodTV reported a 70 mile an hour wind gust measured at the Ford Airport near my house on February 19, 2016. Straight line winds I guess.
we had a storm blow through Indiana on a path to Michigan. What was thought were wind gusts turned out to be a series of weak tornadoes. Tornadoes being common, I've heard a lot of stories. The most amazing to me occurred in this recent storm and occurred in Union Mills Indiana. A tornado picked up 40 calves and laid them down a mile away. Mostly uninjured but in shock. The farm owner was able to take trailers to load them up and bring them back home. Certainly amazing AND tragic events are caused by the Wind.

Join the Center for Communication & Civic Engagement (CCCE) for The Next System Teach-In on April 25 from 1 to 8 p.m. The event, sponsored by the Department of Communication among others, will take place in the Walker Ames Room located in Kane Hall on UW’s Seattle campus.
Join with Affluenza author John de Graaf, City Council Member Kshama Sawant, environmental justice leader Jill Mangaliman, UW faculty, students and community thought leaders in discussion about getting to the next system.
The realities of growing inequality, political stalemate, and climate disruption just scratch the surface of global issues we face today. It is clear that the current system doesn’t work for the vast majority of people on the planet, and we need to work toward something better.
At the same time new ideas and movements are challenging long held boundaries of what’s politically possible, illustrated by the success of Bernie Sanders, the resonance of #BlackLivesMatter, and campaigns to block the fossil fuel economy.
In order to build a world that puts people, communities and the planet first, we need to imagine what’s possible. We invite you to help us build a learning community for realignment of the economy, environment, and democracy so that all three systems work better for people and the planet.

Barley is among the first crops, ever cultivated by humans – it goes back to as early as the fifth millennium B.C. After germinating and drying on the kiln, the barley-corns develop malt, which is the basis for brewing beer as well as distilling whisky.
FLIRT ENGLISH DIALOGUE TRANSCRIPT EPISODE SIX : A DAY OUT 1 AT S AUNTY S HOUSE Dear Diary Things in Cologne are great. Our presentations at the language school went really well. Alex and Nina have had
THE SECRET... or not, because there really are no secrets...just uninformed practitioners who have not yet taken the requisite action steps to succeed at a higher level!
I have been a practicing chiropractor since 1981 and have owned and managed many practices in many different disciplines of healthcare. As a result, I have learned the secrets of success in healthcare. The truth is there are no real secrets, only formulas for success and conversely, formulas for failure. I offer, at a very fair fee, to teach you how to grow your practice, not just during our relationship, but for the lifetime of your career as a health care provder. I share the same success principles with this program that I suggest you, the chiropractor or any other doctor does with the lawyers; have your work be admissible and be the “best-of-the-best” through clinical excellence. You shall win if you have the right programs and protocols in place. This paradigm will ensure that over time, you will become the primary spine care provider in your community for lawyers, medical specialists, medical primary care providers and the public using the same principles of clinical excellence.
Now, for a very big secret...Even if you have $10,000's to spend on a regular basis in personal injury, marketing, newsletters, advertising and fancy steak dinners, they do not work as they are a failed paradigm and a colossus waste of your hard-earned money. If they worked, everyone who ran an advertisement or took a lawyer or medical specialist out for drinks and an expensive dinner would have a huge PI practice and very few do. Marketing and advertising will drive a few patients into your practice from the lawyer, but once the lawyer sees your work, that usually means you are a one-and-done. They send you 1 patient and are done with you…forever!
The biggest "Flag" is if anyone tries to lure you into a scheme showing you a "big check." Anyone can get a big check and the question is will that be sustained and are you being compliant? Those are "rookie tactics" to lure you and do not consider the changes in the profession that occur on a daily basis. Marketing at its best, is about just today and in order to succeed at the highest level, you must know future trends and be prepared for those changes before they occur.
For success in practice, it takes more than marketing. The biggest problem is that you will get the referral; remember, it is always easy to get 1-2 referrals. It's what you do with the referral that will determine your future success in personal injury. In order for the chiropractor, or any doctor, to be successful in personal injury, there must be 3 components involved, admissibility, clinical excellence and strategic documentation. Your work needs to be in the correct format for the courts to accept it into evidence so the lawyer can use it in his case and you need to be the best clinically. That strategic documentation must be "Colossus" compliant or meet the needs of the carriers to ensure that your care is being accepted so that the lawyer can seek a fair and equitable settlement by working with you. o matter the rhetoric in the profession, this is a relatively easy paradigm to accomplish.
Clinical excellence in personal injury has nothing to do with the chiropractor’s ability to get a patient well through adjusting or any modality you use. That is the given and the lawyer expects you to help the patient. Clinical excellence is about being a true specialist in disc pathology, spine pathology, neuropathology, crash dynamics, triaging the injuries, MRI spine interpretation, spinal biomechanical engineering and the doctor needs to have formal credentials. The lawyer has many choices for referrals and your competition is not other chiropractors, it's orthopedists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, etc. The chiropractor, as any expert has to have the knowledge base and the credentials through formal education; that is admissibility. The chiropractor has one very big advantage over other disciplines; they all see the patient once or twice, yet the chiropractor treats the patient 3 times a week for many weeks and understands the continuity of care. In addition, if you, the properly trained chiropractor positions yourself properly, the lawyers WILL bypass the MD specialists and make you there first-line for their referrals. It's sweeping the nation and you could be the recipient in your community.
All that is missing is a system to get the lawyer to run after you because the second you ask for a referral, you lose. Every other doctor in the community is begging for referrals, unsuccessfully. As Einstein said, the definition of insanity is to do the same thing and expect different results…You will lose, too. You need to get the lawyers to run after you.
The most important part of our relationship will be consultations that are included in the monthly fee. These consultations are in a cookbook format that will guide you) will teach you how to speak the language of the lawyers, how to create that paradigm shift so they run after you and when you get a referral, you will know how to triage and care for the patient. I will also share with you many strategies in other areas of your practice from internal and external practice growth ideas to increasing your profitability. If you follow our protocols, your practice will increase in income per patient, not that I will show you extravagant billing strategies, but if you do personal injury or any financial class and document properly using accurate coding and backing it up, you will get paid.
In addition, I will constantly share with you what’s going on in the profession and help guide you in the Future Trends of the chiropractic practice. I have clients nationally that communicate with me regularly and lawyers nationally that I also speak with on a daily basis. I share information with my active clients, usually on a daily basis, so you have the information you need to stay ahead of the curve. We are usually teaching you what you need to do next year in order to get paid, not lose patients, avoid audits and prevent licensure issues. This is another reason why doctors, although able to quit at any time, for any reason CHOOSE to stay a client for 7 years on average. Knowing the future of your industry is poiwerful and keeps you far ahead of the competition. It also allows you to get paid and then keep your money for the right reasons. You were prepared!
The truth is, we do not initially market lawyers and neither will you because it doesn’t work. Through market research we know there is a much more effective way of gaining the legal community's confidence and trust. It involves getting them to consider you, the chiropractor, and getting the referral over the medical specialist without asking. I want to make sure you heard that…Get the referral WITHOUT asking; they have to run after you and we will share with you that formula. It’s very easy.
Lastly, you get me...a coach to call when you need me, on any practice or clinical issue, and that is included in the monthly fee. It's not that I am smarter than other consultants or coaches or even you; it's just that I have been there personally, building my primary practice of 650 visits per week while also owning 3 other practices, consulting medical doctors, hospitals, teaching univiersities, dentists and imaging centers on reimbursement strategies and having made more mistakes than most. The end result, I have learned my lessons well and I want you to win by sharing the solutions with you.
In addition, I have spent time over the last decade learning how to interpret most diagnostic tests that are involved in spinal related trauma, so you get to confer with me, link up via computer and review films and seek advice on treatment strategies. This is all part of the program. Also, you get me not just to convince you to sign up as a client and then “farm you out” to another less experienced consultant. You get me and my 34+ years of experience and no one else. Even if you choose not to join the our program, I still welcome your phone call if you need help because I love doing this stuff…because it’s fun!
The one thing that I urge you to do that will completely explain the program is to watch the video on the home page, even if you do not join the program. It will give you the reasons why lawyers will work with you. Please take the few minutes; it can change your career by giving you answers as to why.

Blaufield present the debut single from Australia's 'Arm In Arm' this September entitled 'Nightfly' with a remix from label heads Booka Shade. Eliza Jacobs and Luke Moore-Martin make up 'Arm In Arm', a duo from Melbourne. After meeting when U.K born Moore-Martin first arrived from London, they instantly connected over their love for music with soul. When Booka Shade discovered 'Arm in Arm', they were attracted to their edgy sound which evoked unexpected emotional nuance thanks to their wide range of influences including techno, Balearic beat, classical, trip-hop and electronica. The extended mix of 'Nightfly' commences the package with modulated top lines, a plucky bass line and hypnotic, yet hooky vocals before Booka Shade offer up their remix of 'Nightfly' contrasting the original by utilising filtered and chopped up vocals, a pulsating low end and an amalgamation of synth blips. Rounding off is the radio version of 'Nightfly' which delivers a shorter mix of the original and brings a well refined close to the package.

Tomlin: “Well guys, the toxicology report came back. Benzodiazepine. The fuckers injected us with Benzodiazepine.”
Tomlin: “Well, apparently if you take a big enough dose, it will make you forgetful and disoriented. Do things you normally wouldn’t do.”
Lebeau: “Pretty ingenious of those guys to fake a power outage, then sneak up and inject us in the neck with that stuff. Pretty fucking low too.”
Arians: “It’s not that I don’t believe you guys. But I really don’t remember feeling a thing. I’m pretty sure nobody injected me at all.”
Lebeau: “But, why, Mike? Why would they do something so despicable? Were they really that desperate for the win?”
Tomlin: “The thing is, Jack Harbaugh is a miserable human being and a horrible, horrible father. He raised two kids in John and Jim that have no sense of decorum. No conscience. No heart. Just two evil doppelgangers spoiled rotten and raised on two core principles—win at all costs and then gloat like a child. So much evil in that family.”
Tomlin: “Well it was a pretty effective tactic. I had no idea why I did some of the stupid shit I did. That clock management right before the half? Wow…so awful. That Benzodiazepine explains a lot.”
Lebeau: “Yes and those cushions that we were giving their receivers. As if we were going up against Joe Montana. No way I do that if I’m in my right mind. Did you see how awful Smith is going downfield? It’s like he was purposely trying to hurt spectators.”
Tomlin: “Yes and why in the world would I send Suisham in there to attempt a 51 yarder on 4th and two? Ben could complete a two yard pass in his sleep. Suisham could try a hundred more times and wouldn’t make that 51 yarder again.”
Tomlin: “I bet if we had Ben tested we would find some Benzo in his system too. That was not him out there the other night. Even with that bum ankle, I expected greatness from him.”
Arians: “I still give him credit for going out there. Did you see how they wrapped that ankle! I bet Goodell fines him for wearing the wrong shoe, though.”
Tomlin: “Well there is no sense dwelling on the past anymore guys. We had our chance to get homefield throughout and we blew it. We still have two games to go, though, and anything can happen. If Baltimore drops one of theirs—and they’re certainly capable—then we have to make sure that we hold up our end and win both. Let’s get to work. St Louis is coming to town and it’s a short week.”
Rooney: “GOOOOD MORNING VIETNAM! (Laughs) I just saw a whole bunch of ‘The Office’ on Netflix. Man, having a job looks like so much fun! Anyway Michael Scott says that in this one episode. Hilarious!”
Rooney: “I remember this one time someone spiked our mimosas at the annual Owners Meeting. That was a crazy night. I woke up in the morning with a dong drawn on my face. Then Benson tried putting his real dong in my face. I almost broke his arm. Fun times!”
Tomlin: “Well we were just talking about putting this game past us and moving on. We got St. Louis coming into town on Christmas Eve.”
Lebeau: “Well, they just want everyone to be able to spend Christmas with their families. A nice gesture if you ask me.”
Rooney: “That’s not a good thing! I was looking forward to the game so I wouldn’t have to spend time with my family! Torture! They should play a game on EVERY holiday.”

The new forum upgrade ate my old build thread, here's what was over on the forums before i stopped posting over there. definitely some missed stuff but at least it's something i can post to again.
bought it back in 2003 with a stock bottom end with edelbrock performer heads, F303, performer RPM intake, the vortech, mac shorties, o/r H-pipe, mac catback, 3.73s, and tremec T3550. 24# injectors with a C&L maf and vortech FMU. Some gauges and billet stuff in the interior and that’s about it. It had issues with loading up on fuel and it would run on the hot side.
Found the loading up problem was a bad fuel pressure regulator was dumping fuel in through the vacuum line into the upper. So basically un-metered fuel was going through the upper intake. Replaced that. Got a fluidyne radiator and that solved the heat issues. Also put in a manual fan switch.
Drove it like that for a while just enjoying the car. I started to get blowby issues from the tired bottom end. I had a breather on the valve cover that was just constantly spewing oil out. So I ordered the following:
the pile of parts that was cleaned up and painted. in retrospect, i wish i would have had them powder coated, but after spending all that money on the upgrades, i was thoroughly tapped out.
Of course with every build you run into an unexpected issue. I had taken the new input shaft and trans to Hanlon Motorsports to have it put it. He found that the synchros were going out and the tailshaft was bent. apparenlty that is a common thing for the T3550s. He hooked me up with a larger diameter tailshaft and new yoke as well as putting new synchros and fork in it.
After it was all installed, i needed a new way to tune the car as the chip that car originally had would no longer work. So i used what little remaining money i had left and went with a PMS. I got a pretty spot on tune from Rick at AFM when i got it too.
nothing really changed much with the car for a while becuase i just blew all my money on the last round of upgrades. i moved into the interior and painted some things silver to add a little more color to the all black interior. i also bought a daily driver at that point so i didn't have to worry about getting around in this car.
The next big thing was the paint job. The car was showing signs of it's age. I wanted to keep the black but didn't just want black. I talked it over with my painter and for starters we chose not to put the factory black on the car since ford's black has brown in it making it look almost a little faded. We went with a true black and i had him add blue pearl. I also wanted to do some kind of stripe. I was debating going with silver stripes but that had already been over done and tends to be very bright. I suggested since we were putting the pearl in the car to lay down some ghost stripes with the blue pearl.
I also had him shave the antenna and the ford emblem in the trunk. Fixing some of the little dents and imperfections:
Let me tell you how much of a pain in arse it was to wire those things in. Or rather the wiring wasn't the issue as was the rapid flash. I tried numerous resistors in the harness to slow it down with no real success. It worked, don't get me wrong, but they would get extremely hot. I found a post in a f150 forum about a different flasher. I ended up going over to autozone and picking up a stock replacement flasher with a trailor feature and BOOM it worked. Just wish i would have tried that first.
the paint now looked great and i again drove it for a while since i blew all my money on the paint job. the 03 cobra wheels just didn't do it justice anymore and i really wanted to change them out but didn't know for what. I ended up getting hired over at American Muscle part time so that gave me some extra cash. Then came the FR500s. I upgraded from stock 03 cobra 17x9s to 18x9/18x10 hypercoated FR500s. I put 265/35/18s up front with 305/35/18 mickey thompson ET street raidal IIs in the back.
It was then that i wanted to redo the exhuast. I kept having issues with the MAC headers leaking becuase they didn't have a solid flange. I wanted to switch over to long tubes. I put in some BBK ceramic coated long tubes and a dr. gas o/r x-pipe. The long tubes were fox ones as i no longer had an EGR anyway and the bellhousing was a fox. that was quite the chore. driver's side went in without problem. The passenger side however took forever. finally got them in though. I found a set of roush side skirts on the craigslist for cheap and so the search started for how i wanted to do the side exhaust setup.
I decided on dual slant cut intercooled borla tips that i would have cut and turned 90degrees. The mufflers had to be small and quiet as possible because i didn't want to be obnoxiously loud but yet still being a straight through style. i didn't want to run the borla side exhuast where the muffler is still in the stock location with same side in/out and then another 90* turn. just isn't very efficient if the air has to turn around twice. I took a chance on dynomax race bullet mufflers. I dropped the car off at the chassis/exhaust shop right next to my painter. There were able to fab up the necessary pieces to have the exhuast flow like i wanted and to adjust the pipes. then it was off to have the skirts painted to match.
The skirts were so much lower than the front and rear bumpers it really threw off the lines. I knew i was going to do something different and was set on the saleen kit for the longest time but after purchasing a fiberglass kit with the intentions of manipulating the rear bumper to smooth over the exhaust humps i realized it wasn't going to be low enough. I put the front on the car and it didn't look right at all. So then search began for a different bumper setup to match with the roush skirts. i don't really like the roush kit for these years other than the side skirts obviously. the rear is okay but the front just looks funny and unfinished. I made a deal with Venomous96cobra for the T1 wing he had and it sat in the closet for a time while i decided what bumpers i wanted to go with.
flash forward to the super stallions of the net race in cecil county fall of 2011. I hadn't been to the track with this car since i got it so i was excited to finally get back at it. The week before i took the car out for a spirited drive and popped a head gasket. the rush was on to replace it so i could it to the race. Ended up having only evidence of the drivers side being popped so i only replaced that side and left the pass side alone knowing full well that the header would give me a hell of time. Got it all back together in time to arrive late to the race and only get a couple passes in. First run was a 12.12 @ 121. Second pass.....watch the video at 43 seconds:
I couldn't get it into 2nd gear and thank god that i did or i would have been a lot closer to him when he crossed over. 3rd pass was a decent launch but on the top end i felt the belt slipping and look back to see some white smoke. I kept in because i figured if it was the damn head gasket again then screw it i'm going to at least make it count. ended up with a 12.11 @ 112. Would have been a probably been a mid 11 second pass but my top end got killed. Low and behold, the only evidence of the coolant was the rad cap popped on me and spewing coolant all over the place. in our rush to get the car back together we didn't fully burp the system. Or at least that's what we attributed it to... It was winter time so the car was put away.
So over the winter, I agonized over getting the GTR bumper for a long time because i couldn't find any pictures of it nor ever see it in person. I knew that i wanted to do something unique but not ricey and this had that but was on the edge of being too much. I still don't know what i want to do with the rear yet. Or at least admit it to the world what i have in mind yet. I ordered the bumper and didn't like it when it arrived. it was very square and huge. I didn't think it would work but i figured that i might as well put it on the car to be sure. It lined up perfectly with the side skirts just not the rounded edge at the wheel well. So I figured why the heck not. Dropped the car off for paint of the bumper and spoiler. Of course the paint scheme would be followed with the stripes through the spoiler. I also had him smooth out the sides of the lip to be more rounded to mimic the side skirts. I didn't think i would like it as much as i do. Came out better than expected. Over the winter i also put new moroso fabbed aluminum valve covers on. I used AN fittings to a moroso catch can w/ breather that i mounted in the driver's side fender.
Of course as always, it was coming down to the wire to get the car ready for Ford Carlisle. I needed to get the car inspected before taking it and i got a call from the guy saying it's pissing coolant on the pass side. so i babied it home tuesday night(leave for carlisle friday morning) since it was a very small leak at that point. head gasket issue again, i should have just skipped that damn SSOTN race and pulled both sides off but live and learn i guess. Started tearing it down and there was just no way to get that pass side header out of the way and the only way the car was going to be ready was if we worked all night and dropped the heads off on wednesday and hope i could get all the stuff i need overnighted for thursday. basically i would have to put it all back together thursday night and hope i didn't have any issues. Couldn't get the pass head off so i said screw it and just didn't bring the car to carlisle.
A buddy of mine had a set of AFR comp 185s that he was going to put on his fox. Been sitting brand new in the box for almost 2 years. He got married and talked him into selling the heads to me instead of just letting them go to waste. So off came the small edelbrock performers and on went the AFRs. The goal was to have the car ready for the American Muscle show in august. problem 1: they were stud mount rockers not pedestals like the eddys. order was placed for comp 1.7s. Problem 2: Summit was drop shipping them from comp who screwed up and shipped them to virgina beach. They made good on it at least and overnighted me some trickflow 1.72s. Wasn't sure what size pushrods i'd need so i got a checker as well. Finally got the pass side head off to find the head gasket was cracked at the number 3 cylinder. Put the new heads on and began the install of the valvetrain. The pushrods i was using before ended up working for me with the new heads/rockers. adjusted the valves to 1/2 turn and installed the rest.
Started it up and the rockers were tapping like crazy. I was out of time at this point and was just too pissed to not chance the drive to the AM show. So i brought it to the show to then discover that the back of the lower intake was puking out oil. Either i didn't put enough RTV on there or there was something wrong. Either way i had to take it back off and fix it. Did a small photo shoot since it was the first time the car was out in the day light since the new bumper/spoiler:
limped the car back home after the show to tear it back down. started the tear down and this happened:
Discovered that i had some bad lifters too. Had the intake welded back together. i got a set of FRPP lifters. The old ones came right out with the heads on still. The new ones wouldn't go in though. they had square heads where as the others had rounded heads. Had to grind down all of them to get them to slip in. That was nerve racking.
Got them installed in and adjusted the valves to a 3/4 turn. Started it up and the valves were still a little noisy but figured it just might take some time to quiet down. I did all the tear down and reinstall on a saturday morning and didn't leave a whole heck of a lot of time to let the RTV seal up. I didn't even get 5 miles down the road before i smell oil burning and see smoke. take it back home and the lower rear intake gasket blew out again. parked it to tear it back down AGAIN. So now the thought was this happened twice in a row so perhaps its because of excessive crankcase pressure not just bad seals. The only thing i've changed is the catch can setup and the heads. Can't be the heads so we're thinking the lines i used aren't big enough to the can. since i had to take the intake off again, i readjusted the valves to a full turn this time and they are quiet now.
This brings us up to date now. I haven't taken it out since this most recent install as it was raining out when i last put it together. i'm hoping to take it out this weekend to prove that it isn't the catch can setup and just two bad seals. If it does blow again, then i have to rethink the catch can setup.
got this from amustangrocksleather.com. black leather w/ blue stitching. install was easy just had to work the leather a bit to get it to smooth out. i'll be getting a shift boot to match. probably some other interior stuff to match as well.
got my newest project in the mail yesterday. this is for the winter build. this pic will be all you get for now though until its done.
uess i can update this somewhat. the front and overall goal is still a secret for now but the rears can at least be shared.
got FRPP rear cobra kit. have to remove the axles to get the brackets on. while i was at it, i had the axles cleaned up and put new lugs in. Diff cover is on but want to torque it down before filling it up.
started to clean up the calipers for a fresh coat of paint. they are going to be painted black to match the new fronts. the rotors that come with the kit are for sale as i want them to match the fronts which are brembo slotted.
got some more accomplished yesterday. Got the rear dif cover torqued down and filled up. i took the rear calipers off to finish cleaning them up as it was proving to be too much hassle leaving them on the car to clean. besides, i'll have to bleed them anyway since i changed out the fronts.
I went to autozone for some caliper paint but they didn't have any black. what they did have was VHT caliper paint in blue which is a lot darker than the duplicolor blue. I originally wanted to do blue to tie in the stripes and add a little color but the duplicolor was waaayyyy too bright. i picked it up to see if i would like it or not. i sprayed the one side and put the wheel on and i think it will look good so the other got sprayed too. The slides on the brackets have a little bit more play in them than i would like so i'm going to get a rebuild kit for it before putting them back in. also waiting on the slotted rotors to come in. of course i forgot to take a picture of it all assembled so this will have to do.
not sure if i'll be working on it next weekend or not as there isn't much more to do until i get the parts i'm waiting on other than cleaning/painting the front calipers.
went to put it all back together in the rear this weekend and that didn't happen. had to take the shock off to get to the bolt for the brake line bracket. then couldn't get the driver's side off because it's torx bit and you can't get a good bite on it. so i let it soak in PB blaster and tried the other side. Got it off after a decent amount of cursing and bleeding. go to put the new J&M line on and it doesn't match.
got to call J&M today and see whats up. otherwise what i'll have to do is grind off the tab holding the line to the bracket on the stock one and use it on the new line.
J&M suggested that i just bend the hardlines and delete the anti-moan brackets. I thought that was a pretty crappy way of doing it. So I ground off the old lines from the factory bracket and mounted the new lines to it. Cleaned it up obviously and painted it. had to file the line mount just a tad for them to work but otherwise it worked out perfectly. In the end, i got the rear on both sides completely buttoned up.
next step if focusing on the fronts. don't expect too much of an update just yet. keeping it hush until it's done.
got work done on it the past couple weekends. Sold off the FR500s and put the tires on these new wheels for now. i thought they would fit a bit better but no such luck. these are iphone pics so nothing special.
So now that the GT500 brakes and vintage venom kit are done. The problem that i now have that has been eluded to already is the wheel fitment. The wheels AM sells are +30mm which works with both SN-95s and S197s. they have to produce one less wheel then. Makes sense from a financial standpoint, but doesn't help me any. I got a new front wheel to test out and it will be close enough for now. don't really have the cash to go all out on custom wheels.
I also had an oil leak that is now discovered to be the rear main seal. I think my breather system isn't allowing enough pressure through and causing it to blow out seals. Its the only thing that makes sense. Yesterday i tore down the trans to get at it. Placed an order for a new rear main seal (Mr. Gasket 1-piece) and a new friction surface for the fidanza flywheel. Also bought a new lower shift boot since mine is all kinds of beat up. Will be replacing the pilot and throwout bearings while i have it all apart. Putting Royal Purple synchromesh back in the trans.
there was a bunch of drama with this because i had given the car to a buddy's father in-law to weld up the leaking oil pan.
stifflers ended up making me a custom one to mount this up and worked great since. @Tom@Stifflers before your time.
FYI to all, don't forget to put the little tiny resistor in line for the charging circuit to work @Det_Riot
didn't take any pics but this is after installing rear coil overs w/ 350lb springs, new HD lcas, new koni shocks, and the panhard bar. still have to put on the HD torque arm.
rides sooo much better now and doesn't rub. also took a BFH to the inner fender area just because i was in there.
some little things also got done. switched out for a FR500 steering wheels with shifty and put on some billet door handles finally
now this brings me up to date. there was a lot more detail for pretty much all this work in the last thread but at least this is the stuff that is recorded in pictures.
Stinks about your old thread. Glad you started a new one! got any future plans for "Midnight Thunder"? Any why not just mount the tweeter in the stock Mach location? It would kill me to drill into my door panel. The cover where the mach system goes is cheaper to replace/fix if you go a different route later on. Looks good though man. I'd like to do the billet door handles but it gets really hot in my car where I am and I'm thinking me no likey to open the door with the top down and the sun beating on those puppies. Metal part of the seat belt KILLS when it touches my skin when I get in. Top up OR down!
i still have that old plate actually. old girlfriend got that for me because the bumper had god awful holes in it.
the tweeters were installed by the previous owner who like an idiot drilled through the door panel instead of using the mach location. i've been on the look out for replacement door panels for years now but never pulled the trigger on them because there was always other things to spend money on. i think i'm finally to the point that i want to swap them out.
Love the new tires in the rear! I can't help but really like the way your car looked back in your fr500 days lol.
you and me both. the new tires go better to make the wheels look more at home but i definitely prefer the fr500s to these wheels. just wanted to go bigger and different. one of these days i'll switch them out for something forged. just hard to justify the cost because there is other things i want to do first. like front suspension being the big one and some custom interior stuff
Car looks so good and that pearl just pops! How do you like the new tires? I have heard good things about them but always from a some guy that knows a guy that has them, never first hand.
i haven't really gotten into it with them yet from a stop. i was incredibly careful on the drive to carlisle because i was gunshy since its been years since i was able to take it there and just wanted to make it. of the driving i've done around town and such the past couple weeks its been really good. i did take it around this one on-ramp that i usually could only do about 40mph around, and it was sticking real nice doing over 50mph. however don't know how much that is just the tires, because i also did the rear coils, lcas, and panhard. definitely look mean as hell though
Sucks about the PO, some people just don't have any common sense. Might be able to fill the holes and match it well enough not to notice.
Hard to make 20's work. Not that i'm a wheel expert in any way but i always sacrifice tire sidewall and suspension travel when i run a bigger wheel lol. Not idea for performance but it looks hot
really i just went with the larger tires because i got discount on that size through AM. i paid more for these NT05s than i did for the NT555Rs i had before.
I know what you mean, I had 20's on my 96 with no suspension mods and they rubbed like a mother. Turning and anytime the suspension flexed. Not really my style but I did like the deep dish in the back. This was back in college when I had no money for mods...oh wait I still don't.....
hahaa, those aren't too bad imo. billet specialties? seems like a lot of older minitruckers used to have those wheels.
I honestly don't know. My dad picked this up at an auction and he knew I liked these cars so I got a steal for it. Shined up nice but just not my style.
i had ordered some stuff from CJ's a while back. got some new trunk struts (HUGE difference those made), a new trunk weatherstrip and a fuel filler tube grommet. weatherstrip and grommet were on backorder but got them last week. replaced the weatherstrip last night and cleaned up some wiring that i put in when i did the export tails. basically i screwed up and wired two wires with a connector in line like i wanted but on the wrong side...so when i disconnected the trunk harness and that connector, it was still tied to the car. my own dumbass mistake. but it's all good now after i rewired it correctly.
meeting up with a guy tonight to get some door panels to replace the ones i have. hopefully they are in as good condition as the guys says they are. couldn't tell anything wrong from the pictures he posted. plan is to get them replaced and the filler grommet on saturday.
door panels were a bust. not in what i would call "good" condition. i still bought them and my plan is to now mess with them as a test bed for recovering mine. upholstery was always something that seemed like black magic to me so who knows if i'll figure it out enough to make it worth it but its worth the try.
what about that guy that is just down the street see what he can do with them ? like black velvet or something ?
yeah that was my thought originally but he's swamped with work and he does pretty much all custom work from scratch. i do want to pick his brain more about it though
Why not just cover the current panels with some leather vinyl? Get rid of the plastic look in the car. That's my plan. My old E38 had leather everything and I loved it! And dude, I love the exports!!!! I wish I had these on either of my 94s! Hopefully I can find a set one day for my 96!
i thought about that too but i feel at this point that i if do something on this car i have to do top notch. not saying the leather vinyl is junk or anything but i feel like if i'm going to do it, i want actual leather/swede.
No doubt I understand that. Just throwing it in there. Most people cringe at the thought of the cost of all that. So I start with that lol
went out to Eastwood's summer classic show saturday. pretty decent turn out with a good amount of really sweet cars. my favorite pic of the car. that's my dad's 57
not really of the actual show. just wasn't in the mood for taking a bunch of pics. it's been forever since i just went to a show to enjoy looking at cars so that's what i did.
couple weeks back i switched out my ignition control module because i was having this weird intermittent problem. Basically the car would be driving fine down the road and it would just hiccup for a moment. just not spark for a split second. wideband would show it drop down to like 10 and then come back to stoich. couldn't figure it out for the longest time. thought it was a grounding problem. ended up switching out the control module and drove much better. also moved it into the fenderwell rather than the engine bay.
drove it today to work and got into a decent bit on the one road. from me messing with the tune with a defective TFI, i now definitely need to retweak it. was breaking up pretty bad on WOT.
still rocking an off the shelf parts store brand, but i think i'm going to get a performance distributor like Dan had mentioned.
Ok, let's get this out in the open right now. I LOVE marshmallows. I think this love stems from when I was a kid and my Mom would use marshmallows as a bribe to get me to take my ear infection medicine.
On an unrelated note - was I the only kid to get ear infections constantly? I remember at one point my Doctor telling me that I was not allowed to have any more ear infections because he was tired of treating me.
So anyways, I found this recipe on Pinterest while Dude and I were in Arizona and it's been on my to-do list ever since. Last weekend, I picked up a candy thermometer and I knew it was marshmallow time; and can I say, this recipe does not disappoint. The marshmallows turn out light and fluffy, with just the right amount of cake flavor.
I made my marshmallows in two layers - a "cake" and a "frosting" layer. If you don't want to go through the trouble, or if you're a marshmallow racist and don't like chocolate or vanilla, you can just make one thick layer in the flavor of your choice. The directions below are to make two layers.
First up, cover a 9x9 pan with parchment paper and grease it really well. I used a vegetable oil spray, but I think a butter spray or straight butter or vegetable oil would work just fine.
If you live in a hick town like me and can't find caster sugar anywhere, don't fret! Caster sugar is just superfine sugar and you can make it by throwing regular granulated sugar in a food processor for a couple minutes.
To be honest, I don't think this step is 100% essential, but the perfectionist in me struggles to not follow a recipe exactly.
So the next step is to melt together 1 cup of your sugar and 2tsp of corn syrup with 100ml of water. Why 100ml? Because that's what my inspiration recipe called for and I can't do conversions.
Last time I attempted to convert something from metric to US, I used a half-gallon of milk in a recipe that was really calling for close to a quart.
While you're waiting, measure out 100ml of water and pour it into a small bowl and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of plain gelatine over the top and let it sit while your sugar melts. This ended up being roughly a packet and a half for me.
Once the sugar has melted, break out your candy thermometer and clip it to the side of the saucepan. Increase the heat to medium high and boil until the temperature reaches 250° F.
When the temperature reaches 250°, immediately remove the pan from the heat and set it to the side while you complete the next step.
Separate one large egg white and pour it into the bowl of a stand mixer. You can still make this recipe if you don't have a stand mixer, it'll just take a bit longer.
Time to start moving, the sugar/gelatine mix will start to get super sticky and gooey pretty quickly.
Wait, we may be on to something...savory marshmallows... Someone else try this and tell me how it goes.
Beat the egg and sugar until it's glossy and white. This took me probably 3 or 4 minutes. With a hand mixer, I imagine it will take closer to 6-8 minutes. (Think of your ripped biceps! So worth it!)
When the stuff in your mixer bowl starts to look like marshmallow fluff, turn the mixer off and fold in 2 tablespoons of sifted white cake mix. You can always add more if you want a more "cakey" flavor.
Pour the gooey marshmallow fluff into your prepared pan and put it in the fridge while you make the chocolate layer.
Combine 1 cup of sugar, 2 teaspoons of corn syrup and 100ml of water. Heat over low heat until the sugar is melted.
Meanwhile, measure out 100ml of water again and pour it in a small bowl. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of gelatine over the water and let it sit while your sugar melts.
Whisk the gelatine into the hot sugar; and when it is smooth, gradually add it to the mixing bowl with the egg white.
Let that sucker mix until you have a big old bowl of marshmallow fluff. Or work your arms again. Then you have a free pass to not feel guilty about licking the beaters and the spatula.
Actually I used a stand mixer and I will never feel guilty about licking the spatula. That's just a rule I live by.
Notice the tiny-ass bowl I was using here to sift the cake mix. If you look closely, you can see the giant-ass mess I made on the counter underneath it.
Now, avoid turning around and looking at your kitchen for as long as you can. And when you do, just know that I feel your pain.
When the marshmallows are good and chilly, you are less than an hour away from all the marshmallowy goodness you can handle.
The next steps are to cut the marshmallows and give them a light coat of powdered sugar to keep them from sticking together. You can do this by either individually rolling each cut marshmallow in a bowl of powdered sugar...
...or put a little powdered sugar in a plastic bag and dump all your cut marshmallows in there and shake it up.
You can cut your square of marshmallows however you like with a greased knife, but Dude and I found that spraying some spray butter on a pizza cutter was by far the simplest method.
To be honest, I didn't taste any difference between the marshmallows straight out of the powdered sugar and the ones that had dried for an hour and the ones that sat in the fridge for 3 days so all you rebels out there, feel free to disregard this final step.
In the name of science, I decided to make a s'more out of these marshmallows. Check out what happens when you heat up homemade marshmallows.
How fun are these?! Makes me want a candy thermometer ... oh, and a Kitchenaid ;) Thanks for sharing it with us!
Thanks so much!! I realized after you commented that I didn't have a link back to your party! (D'oh, party foul!) It's updated now! Thanks for taking the time to stop by and comment!
What a great recipe! I would love for you to share this or any of your great ideas at the link party going on now (and every Saturday through Tuesday) at 'Or so she says ...' Hope to see you there! www.oneshetwoshe.com

The thing is, there is no video could be? You've got 2 defective motherboards. Hey everyone, first post here and that system for gaming though. I currently have an un-upgraded video card and RAM for $300-400.
On my Spirit Mythos Forums, someone posted a link to my Astro-mythic section on Spirit Mythos on Taurus. I was given this info on all the signs by Thoth around 1997. I went up to read it again and a chain of "ahaaas" bubbled forth! I posted this on the thread of the SM post, and I am repeating it here for all of you. But first, in order for it to really make sense to you, I would suggest that you read the "Taurus" page on SM:
A lot of LIGHTS WILL SHOULD GO ON for you just reading this, which I have to explain a bit to the SM readers. Below is my post to them:
I went back just now to read the info on SM on Taurus - this was given to me by Thoth around 1996 or 1997 I think. I doubt I have read it through since, except to scan it (with my eyes) when I put it up on the website several years ago.
So it was like reading something I had never read before! I was BLOWN AWAY by the name "Rhama" and it's connection to Orion - the being wearing a "cap of stars." WHY? Because as most of SM regulars know, I lead a "double life" in my spiritual work in the sense that the other out-picturing for me is through the soul of Elvis Presley and my website and forums: Elvis A Lighted Candle.
About a year after Elvis' passing in 1997 I received that in his "new" realm (he is now in Numis'OM) his higher spiritual name is "Rhama Azul." Well, when I originally received the Taurus info I doubt I even remembered this connection. However, just recently, Elvis / Rhama Azul has begun to come to me as Thoth does, and is asking to "speak" through me to those who follow the "merkabah" of "Lighted Candle" - especially the ELC Forums. These individuals are on similar paths as those in the SM Forums. The only difference is that to them, Elvis's soul is their "avatar" so to speak - not god-like - but they are drawn to his SPIRIT and his spiritual example when he lived as Elvis (so mis-understood, distorted , lied about and trampled by the media and the greedy).
So I have JUST BEGUN placing messages from him up on the "A Field of Roses" (he named it) Fourm on the ELC Forums.
Elvis told his close spiritual friends, such as Wanda Hill (my friend of many, many years) that his soul came from Rigel, the "Blue Star" in Orion - this he said (and I have a copy of his voice saying it to her on tape) long before I received anything about Rigel, the Blue Star and Orion! Before I knew Elvis had said this to Wanda or anyone, I was told by Thoth that Elvis was a Blue Star Solarian. I wrote this to Wanda, who I barely knew then and she flipped as she had not shared what he told her with ANYONE!
Then there is the "coincidence" that just before I came up to the SM Forums today, I was talking to Wanda Hill. She came across a ring Elvis had given her years ago - it is a large male ring - obvious handmade from what looks to be iron and silver. She is going to photograph it and send the images to me. Elvis told her that this ring was given to him when he was a member of an "Order of Melchizedek" and that he was studying with them. He had met some people of the order through his membership in the Self-Realization Fellowship. This is no ordinary ring - it is banged up and ANCIENT looking and handmade! Someone gave this to him for a reason. Later, he told Wanda that he did not continue with the order because he was not "pure enough." He tried to give the ring back, but they would not take it. They apparently felt it belong to him. I see (akashically) that they KNEW he was ALREADY a priest in this order!
This ring is very heavy, made from metal, not silver, not all gold and seems to be brass and something? It is big. On the sides are shields with the three point top and oval/rounded sides and bottom. On the shields that can still be seen somewhat, it's very well worn and old, are eagles with the wings spread and the head sideways-they are small and they are standing on big boughs it looks like, though hard to tell it's so worn. There is blue inlay of some kind below the bough and rounded areas that seem to be water maybe or perhaps clouds in the sky? Above the eagles head is a curved long vine or something with one arrow head looking leaf at the end? that's on the sides of the ring. The top has a large base that is beveled to look like to me, sun rays all around a center that has a raised bed of what looks like copper, and on top of that is another "set" that is about 1/2 inch long and a tad less wide with a cut off top and bottom to the whole thing. I will try to draw a picture of this entire thing. Now, in the center of the top setting is some kind of design that has gold set into it or onto it in the very center-when the light or sun hits it is sends a bright light out of it. The top is a rough cross as far as I can tell-it is worn down too, and there is behind the cross red color inlay. Across the whole bed is some white inlay that looks like maybe a robe-or part of one-it's worn down too. And at the bottom is about 4 curved narrow blue inlays . Now, the entire set with the color and markings is edged in gold. Around the under bed is a wreath of leaves that go all around the top setting of metal and colored areas. I can't tell what it is exactly but I think it has religious meanings in some way-spiritual meanings of some type. The entire thing is strange as it was very old and hand made-roughly hand made but extremely well detailed I imagine when new. This ring was given to him, he was supposed to give it back when he didn't complete the necessary steps and etc: that it took to reach his goal-to be a priest so he could really help people in need of spiritual guidance. This was when he was wearing those big scarves over his shoulders-different colors-white for step one, gold for step two and there was two more-with the last one to be lavender. I don't know the third now. He gave it up because Priscilla (even though they were separated and divorcing) and his father ridiculed his efforts and desires so much, and convinced him he wasn't able to handle his own problems-how could he even think he could handle anyone else's? etc. Anyway, he felt he couldn't do it-plus he couldn't rid himself of the sleeping pills entirely at that time either. He thought they were wrong for what he wanted to be and do also.
Anyway this ring was supposed to be more than 100 years old and I believe it-they would not take it back from him because they felt he should have it-he was very moved by that and I think I have seen pictures of him wearing it-on stage shots-but only a very few times...he gave it to me and said that I should keep it as it was valuable and the spiritual background of it was sacred. He wanted me to keep it, put it away safe and leave it there until I found the right place for it...that it would show me when the time was right. I should never wear it except when I needed to have spiritual strength and understanding as it would "protect and guide me" and then he said those many spirits from it's past...would be there for me. Well, as I said, I have been going through things and I had totally and completely forgotten that ring! It was kind of scary to have it, I put it up and forgot about it!!! Anyway, I have it out now and I thought maybe I can get some photographs of it. I don't have a clue as to what it is on it or what it represents at all.
He said it had come from European background and he was looking forward to being "worthy of it" and I think that is why he quit wearing it-he didn't want to keep it for fear it would "disappear" or he'd "lose" it somehow. I think he was afraid someone would take it or discard it because it's not actual gold or white gold-but it does have some on it. That center strip is almost like a lighting bolt but it's worn and you can't tell really what it was-but it certainly reflects the light! As does the edging which is very tiny and delicate.
I'm shaken. I don't understand much of what is happening, but I do feel that something BIG is coming through some door that has been opened.
Youl'd be amazed to see how many special circumstances have been occurring to me these last two days, not only in the Forum (where they occurred also) but in my everyday life. All of them concatenate, signaling in one direction: the confirmation that this is a moment for expanding conscience and for the taking of extraordinary action from that point. Somehow, I observe that Elvis is related to it, but as a part of a bigger plan. I can sense it. The feeling I have is like Heavens had opened and innumerable impacts are coming from everywhere up there, to awake us once for all.
What you posted above follow the trend I was talking about: pieces and pieces being put together, showing a multidimensional pattern, interlinked with our present moment. What was first a glimpse, is becoming now a certainty, an understanding from the heart, because the logycal mind can not register it, due it's out of commun experience.
I don`t know how to comment on this, but I feel there is coming something very very special. That`s all I can say at the moment...
One day, in the future--not too far out of our reasoning, either, it will be different. The time is coming when the portals will open, our earth will be back on beam and those living on the other plane will be able to reach us, and us them.
While searching information about Elvis' spiritual experiences while being a child, to answer a question a guest friend did in other place, I topped with that above. See what I mean?
Something called my attention: Do you know how is it that Elvis A-Rama Musseum is named that way?!!!
Even though some of her info on it is repeated from this thread, some is ADDED, so you might with to read it all (of what she writes).
It is interesting the El'vis / Rhama Azul says that the ring was made by Paracelsus (he designed it and had it carfted), and just today Wanda told me (after I put uo the ring web page) that she showed the ring to an oriental who said that the symbols on the ring were "alchemy," Well, Paracelsus was an alchemist!
I'm probably way off on this but the twisted circular rope like patterns on the top of the ring reminded me of a Celtic knot, tho' perhaps a bit more tightly woven than what I've seen on other artwork.
I hope there will be someone out there who will come to ELC and know what this "order of monks" was called, their purpose and intentions and what they represent in our world today. I know there were others-men-whom Elvis said he met some of at the Self Realization Center and that some were other actors and public figures and some were just "businessmen". He rode motorcycles with some of them-a few times-he and some had prayer together each morning-not personally together, but spiritually together at the same time of day. They were not Masons-I know that. It was something to do with Knights...and the word white was connected...and it was not like kkk or anything of that nature-did not bring race into it at all. He was so pleased to be taking part in it, and he said, "You all will be so proud of me when I do this...an' you're going to love my robe-it's beautiful! For the cermonies he would wear a monks robe-I think he said it was white-and he would have a gold "mantle". I guess like a scarf or band that went around the neck and shoulders.? Anyway, he was just so pleased and shy about it and absolutely refused to discuss anything or talk about what he was doing. For him NOT to talk about something was unique-it was that important to him. Of course he had talked about it and his family had struck him down for it-especailly the fact that he was going to donate money to this "order" and to want to become a "monk" and have long periods of time awayfrom them and everything material-it would scare them. Especially the Colonel etc;...and the guys.
I mean, what would they do??? And Priscilla, already losing him to his books etc: and career and now this!
A frightening thought I'm sure. He just didn't know or couldn't see how they thought about it or their fears.
He was too innocent-he wouldn't have any idea that they would not be proud of him, pleased that he felt so strongly about helping other people and doing good works. But it looks like his daughter has inherited that from him, he got that done well. She's a chip of the old block for sure. More power to her! wjh
Then there's something called the "Great White Brotherhood". Don't know much about it and it's considered imaginary, but supposedly there's a hierarchy of spiritual beings who oversee humanity and initiates are contacted telepathically from Tibet.

October 24, 2015 – New York, NY – Clean Water for Everyone (CWFE), a growing social enterprise, closed an undisclosed seed round of funding. Funding will be used to expand CWFE water and sanitation business in Ghana. The expansion includes major revenue generating infrastructure and human capital investments. The Gates Foundation estimates global demand for financing water and sanitation to be over $12 billion.
Over 3,000 children die annually from poor water sources and toilets in Ghana. CWFE addresses the lack of affordable access to water and sanitation for Ghanaian schools that would otherwise have no access to these basic needs. While Ghana has made important strides in this area, an estimated 13% of the country’s population (over 3 million people) still lacks decent access to clean water, while 27% (over 7 million) lacks access to decent sanitation.
“We want to transform the global water and sanitation crisis into economic opportunities.” said Abbey Wemimo, CEO. For Ghana, CWFE introduced a business model that is revenue generating and affords a strong value proposition for our customers. CWFE will offer debt financing for capital-intensive water and sanitation infrastructure in schools.
Additionally, CWFE has tested its value proposition through a Clinton Global Initiative Commitment to Action in Kasoa, Ghana. This project, which was initiated in 2014, supplies clean water and suitable sanitation to 150 students enrolled at the Mummy Educational Institute. This project is functional and generating revenue.
“We are revolutionizing the way clean water and sanitation is provided.” For more information, visit www.cwfe.org

The Bad News: After 15 days we have decided to cancel the Kickstarter campaign for Dead Crusade. It has not been an easy decision to pull the project from Kickstarter, but we do not see the project getting funded at this point and would prefer to not mislead our fans and backers. A lot of sacrifice and effort went into making this Kickstarter possible, and we would prefer to not drag things out or have the project look bad.
There are a number of reasons we believe the Kickstarter did not succeed, and I wanted to take a moment to explain a few in detail.

We would like to recognize all of the sites which have featured Dead Crusade since we announced our Kickstarter. We appreciate their coverage and wanted to express our thanks! If you’ve seen Dead Crusade mentioned on a website not listed below, please let us know in the Comments!
“There has never been a game that properly fuses both genres together”, according to Scott Petty, creative director of Aesthetic Games Inc, the makers of Dead Crusade. A game that features a merciless fusion of medieval fantasy and apocalyptic horror.
Let it be said that the story setting, the 14th century Black Death pandemic wiping out 30–60% of Europe’s population – is a perfect setting for horror. Not only do the death-estimates run between 350–375 million people. The Plague’s symptoms are strikingly similar to zombie-like features.
It is a rather obscure observation, and a very exciting one, that the grossness of it all is meticulously well captured due to this game’s technology – thanks to EPIC games.
We’ve posted a new video on YouTube which showcases more Unreal 4 environments, as well as a bit more Gameplay and Combat footage which we built while we were still working in Unreal Engine 3. We feel it’s important to show this material, even though it will take some time to revamp and migrate this into Unreal 4.
Dead Crusade is a refreshing take on the Zombie Apocalypse. Dead Crusade is a medieval survival horror RPG that will take you to Medieval Europe in a time of great upheaval and strife as an unstoppable plague tears the world apart. Travel through the cities, countryside, and cemeteries of Medieval Europe across multiple expansive campaigns as you battle hordes of the undead, and avoid becoming infected with the plague yourself. Check out our unique approach to this genre with realistic settings and developed characters.
Welcome to the official website for Dead Crusade, an upcoming Medieval Horror game built with Unreal Engine 4.

The evidence is clear that Benedict is far from the ‘reformer’ some Vatican insiders claim. The Times reports that the church has a culture of “nonresponsibility, denial, legalistic foot-dragging and outright obstruction” on abuse. For decades, Benedict has helped create and maintain, and now heads, that culture.
So it’s no surprise that, in spite of continuing revelations and crimes and cover ups, so little is changing in the church.
One critical fact is obscured by the article’s extensive focus on formal church policies: Every bishop has known for decades that it’s wrong to molest children and conceal crimes from police. Yet few bishops called police then and few call police now about child molesting clerics.
(No matter what a private company’s official internal policy is on physical assault, every employee knows it’s wrong to beat up others and hide beatings from police.)
The Times reports that "Bishops had a variety of disciplinary tools at their disposal — including the power to remove accused priests from contact with children and to suspend them from ministry altogether — that they could use without the Vatican’s direct approval."
But bishops had, and have, one other powerful tool (which is also a solemn duty) to tell the truth, expose the predators, warn the parishioners and protect the kids. Even now, very few bishops voluntarily do this. That’s the crux of the crisis.
As hundreds of thousands of boys and girls across the globe were being sexually assaulted by clerics, it’s especially troubling to read that:
-- Benedict was “busy pursuing other problems (including) examining supernatural phenomena, like apparitions of the Virgin Mary,” and "the diminishing image” of the priesthood.
-- Benedict “focused on reining in national bishops’ conferences, several of which, independent of Rome, had begun confronting the sexual abuse crisis and devising policies to address it.”
-- It took bishops from ten English-speaking nations to force Vatican staff, in 2000, to even discuss potential reforms.
If, as the Times says, “bishops who sought to penalize and dismiss abusive priests were daunted by a bewildering bureaucratic and canonical legal process,” that’s largely because the safety of kids has been trumped, in bishops’ minds and deeds, by the preservation of their own power and reputations.
Catholic officials are smart men with plenty of resources. A simple, speedy way to defrock criminals could be set up but still hasn’t been. That refusal speaks volumes about the callousness of the Catholic hierarchy.
What will be the impact of these disclosures? We believe they will likely be a severe blow to two long-standing, disingenuous church canards: that the Vatican doesn’t control or direct bishops on handling abuse cases, and that bishops “just didn’t understand” abuse until just a few years ago.
At least three times – in 1996, 1998 and 2001 – English-speaking bishops met to discuss clergy sex crimes and cover ups. So it’s deceitful for these men to have repeatedly claimed in 2002 “Geez, we just didn’t know how widespread or harmful abuse is” or “We had little experience in dealing with abuse.” They knew. They just refused to act.
And who knows how many other secret meetings about clergy sex crimes and cover ups, large and small, have been held involving bishops across the planet and officials in Rome
These revelations will likely help the legal moves to hold the Pope and his staff responsible for the sexual violations of children by predatory priests, nuns, bishops, brothers and seminarians.
-- the notion that bishops’ “approaches (to abuse) are remarkably uneven from country to country.” We find them remarkably similar, for the most part. Keeping the crimes of predator priests quiet is, across the board, bishops top priority, as best we can tell, across the globe.
-- the claim, by Nicholas P. Cafardi, that “When it came to handling child sexual abuse by priests, our legal system fell apart.”
-- the speculation that more recent US church abuse policies "seem to be having an impact." It's simply premature to make this claim, especially because, as the Times notes, "victims of child abuse rarely came forward until they were well into adulthood."

In its long struggle to grapple with sexual abuse, the Vatican often cites as a major turning point the decision in 2001 to give the office led by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger the authority to cut through a morass of bureaucracy and handle abuse cases directly.
The decision, in an apostolic letter from Pope John Paul II, earned Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, a reputation as the Vatican insider who most clearly recognized the threat the spreading sexual abuse scandals posed to the Roman Catholic Church.
But church documents and interviews with canon lawyers and bishops cast that 2001 decision and the future pope’s track record in a new and less flattering light.
The Vatican took action only after bishops from English-speaking nations became so concerned about resistance from top church officials that the Vatican convened a secret meeting to hear their complaints — an extraordinary example of prelates from across the globe collectively pressing their superiors for reform, and one that had not previously been revealed.
And the policy that resulted from that meeting, in contrast to the way it has been described by the Vatican, was not a sharp break with past practices. It was mainly a belated reaffirmation of longstanding church procedures that at least one bishop attending the meeting argued had been ignored for too long, according to church documents and interviews.
The office led by Cardinal Ratzinger, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, had actually been given authority over sexual abuse cases nearly 80 years earlier, in 1922, documents show and canon lawyers confirm. But for the two decades he was in charge of that office, the future pope never asserted that authority, failing to act even as the cases undermined the church’s credibility in the United States, Australia, Ireland and elsewhere.
Bishop Geoffrey Robinson, an outspoken auxiliary bishop emeritus from Sydney, Australia, who attended the secret meeting in 2000, said that despite numerous warnings, top Vatican officials, including Benedict, took far longer to wake up to the abuse problems than many local bishops did.
“Why did the Vatican end up so far behind the bishops out on the front line, who with all their faults, did change — they did develop,” he said. “Why was the Vatican so many years behind?”
Cardinal Ratzinger, of course, had not yet become pope, a divinely ordained office not accustomed to direction from below. John Paul, his longtime superior, often dismissed allegations of pedophilia by priests as an attack on the church by its enemies. Supporters say that Cardinal Ratzinger would have preferred to take steps earlier to stanch the damage in certain cases.
But the future pope, it is now clear, was also part of a culture of nonresponsibility, denial, legalistic foot-dragging and outright obstruction. More than any top Vatican official other than John Paul, it was Cardinal Ratzinger who might have taken decisive action in the 1990s to prevent the scandal from metastasizing in country after country, growing to such proportions that it now threatens to consume his own papacy.
As pope, Benedict has met with victims of sexual abuse three times. He belatedly reopened an investigation into the Rev. Marcial Maciel Degollado, founder of the Legionaries of Christ, a powerful religious order — and a protégé of John Paul’s — and ultimately removed him from ministry. He gave American bishops greater leeway to take a tough line on abuse in the United States, and recently accepted the resignations of several bishops elsewhere. And on June 11, at an event in St. Peter’s Square meant to celebrate priests, he begged “forgiveness from God and from the persons involved” and promised to do “everything possible” to prevent future abuse.
But today the abuse crisis is still raging in the Catholic heartland of Europe: civil investigators in Belgium last week took the rare step of raiding church headquarters and the home of a former archbishop. The Vatican under Benedict is still responding to abuse by priests at its own pace, and it is being besieged by an outside world that wants it to move faster and more decisively.
Vatican officials, who declined to answer detailed questions related to Benedict’s history, say that the church will announce another round of changes to its canon laws, as it did in 2001, so that the church can improve its response to the abuse problem.
But the suggestion that more reforms are ahead is a nod to the fact that there is still widespread confusion among many bishops about how to handle allegations of abuse, and that their approaches are remarkably uneven from country to country.
National bishops’ conferences in some countries have adopted their own norms and standards. But several decades after sexual abuse by priests became a problem, Benedict has not yet instituted a universal set of rules.
The sexual abuse scandal first caught much of the world’s attention in 2002, with reports that the Boston archdiocese had been covering up for molesters for years. But the alarm bells had already been sounding for nearly two decades in many countries. In Lafayette, La., in 1984, the Rev. Gilbert Gauthé admitted to molesting 37 youngsters. In 1989, a sensational case erupted at an orphanage in the Canadian province of Newfoundland. By the mid-1990s, about 40 priests and brothers in Australia faced abuse allegations. In 1994, the Irish government was brought down when it botched the extradition of a notorious pedophile priest.
Bishops had a variety of disciplinary tools at their disposal — including the power to remove accused priests from contact with children and to suspend them from ministry altogether — that they could use without the Vatican’s direct approval.
Some used this authority to sideline abusive priests, minimizing the damage inflicted on their victims. Other bishops clearly made things worse, by shuffling abusers from one assignment to the next, never telling parishioners or reporting priests to the police.
But as court cases, financial settlements and media coverage mounted, many prelates looked to the Vatican for leadership and clarity on how to prosecute abusers under canon law and when to bring cases to the attention of the civil authorities. In the worst cases, involving serial offenders who denied culpability and resisted discipline, some bishops sought the Vatican’s guidance on how to dismiss them from the priesthood.
For this, bishops needed the Vatican’s help. Dismissing a priest is not like disbarring a lawyer or stripping a doctor of his medical license. In Catholic theology, ordaining a priest creates an indelible mark; to return him to the lay state required the approval of the pope.
Yet throughout the ’80s and ’90s, bishops who sought to penalize and dismiss abusive priests were daunted by a bewildering bureaucratic and canonical legal process, with contradicting laws and overlapping jurisdictions in Rome, according to church documents and interviews with bishops and canon lawyers.
Besides Cardinal Ratzinger’s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, bishops were sending off their files on abuse cases to the Congregations for the Clergy, for Bishops, for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, and for the Evangelization of Peoples — plus the Vatican’s Secretariat of State; its appeals court, the Apostolic Signatura; and the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts.
A new Code of Canon Law issued in 1983 only muddied things further, among other things by setting a five-year statute of limitations within which abuse cases could be prosecuted.
During this period, the three dozen staff members working for Cardinal Ratzinger at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith were busy pursuing other problems. These included examining supernatural phenomena, like apparitions of the Virgin Mary, so that hoaxes did not “corrupt the faith,” according to the Rev. Brian Mulcahy, a former member of the staff. Other sections weighed requests by divorced Catholics to remarry and vetted the applications of former priests who wanted to be reinstated.
The heart of the office, though, was its doctrinal section. Cardinal Ratzinger, a German theologian appointed prefect of the congregation in 1981, aimed his renowned intellectual firepower at what he saw as “a fundamental threat to the faith of the church” — the liberation theology movement sweeping across Latin America.
