TEL AVIV — The saddest and perhaps most telling moment came even before the Labor Party vote that denied former Prime Minister Shimon Peres an honorary position as party president.
In a bitter speech just before party convention delegates voted this week on whether to discuss appointing him to the new post, Peres, who led Labor to five election defeats, asked rhetorically: "Am I a loser?"
"Yes," came the humiliating response, shouted by a handful of delegates throughout the crowded auditorium.
Party members then effectively killed the presidency proposal, voting overwhelmingly to put off debate on it until well after a new party leadership is chosen next month. Peres had said earlier that unless the vote was held during the party's three-day convention, which ends today, he would not accept the position.
The loss, underscored by the insult from party members, marked an ignominious end to Peres' formal leadership of Labor, which will choose its new chairman and candidate for prime minister June 3. The decisive vote was also a key victory for former army Chief of Staff Ehud Barak, the man heavily favored to succeed Peres as party leader.
To some extent at least, Peres brought the rejection upon himself, stubbornly struggling to hang on to a policymaking role after being turned out of office in last year's election loss to Likud Party leader Benjamin Netanyahu.
"I have a title and I have a job," he said Wednesday. "The title is Shimon Peres, and the job is to fight for peace."
Nonetheless, the convention vote spells "the end of the prolonged end" for Peres, said Avraham Burg, a Peres confidant and former parliament member. "Shimon Peres' political end came with the results of the election last year, but he tried to hold on to the leadership. It didn't work."
In his own convention speech, Barak praised Peres for his "experience, inspiration and greatness" but argued that naming him to Labor's presidency would create rival centers of power in the party.
Many attending the convention here, even some who voted with Barak, appeared ill at ease with the infighting that preceded the vote and with the decision to close the door on a distinguished party elder.
"Why is Shimon humiliating himself like this?" asked Barak delegate Yudit Gal, 40. "I love him very much, but it's time for him to go."
Lawmaker Ophir Pines, who wore a Barak sticker, called the episode a tragedy for Peres and the party.
"Shimon Peres is a great man, but he doesn't know how to draw the lines for himself, when to leave political life," Pines said. "We want to give him all the honor, all the influence, but we cannot give him any more the leadership of this party."
Even as it turns to a new generation of leaders, however, the Labor Party signaled it will continue on the peace-making course set by Peres and others.
For the first time, delegates approved adding to its platform a statement recognizing the Palestinian right to self-determination, including the establishment of a Palestinian state with limited sovereignty.
Such a state, the party said, would not be allowed to have an army, to establish military alliances with other nations or to control its own airspace. That platform plank was similar to statements made in recent months by Netanyahu and other senior officials within his Likud-led government.
Peres, 73, an architect of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, won a Nobel Peace Prize for that achievement, sharing the honor with the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat. Peres served twice as prime minister, first in a power-sharing arrangement with the Likud Party in the 1980s, then again after Rabin was assassinated in 1995.
But he never led the party to victory in his own right, marring his illustrious political and diplomatic career with the stigma of a perennial also-ran.
He waited until September to announce that he would not run again for prime minister and then flirted openly for months with the idea of joining Netanyahu in a national unity government to rescue the flagging peace process.
After Netanyahu's government was tainted this spring by an influence-peddling scandal, Peres, prodded by other Labor Party leaders, finally said he would no longer consider a partnership.
His supporters, chiefly Labor Party General Secretary Nissim Zvili, then came up with the plan to create the new position for him.
But Barak sought to ensure that the post would hold no real power, and Peres said he would not consider a role without authority.
Supporters insisted after the vote that Peres could continue to contribute, particularly to the peace process that he nurtured with creativity and passion.
"The world belongs to the young," delegate Avraham Levi, 62, said sadly as he sat alone during a break. "Not to me and not to him."
Rabin, Peres and Arafat Share Nobel : Honor: Peace prize awarded for historic agreement between Israel and Palestinians. But soldier's abduction creates strain between parties.
Errors: Floridians drew stars, circles and Xs. They used pens instead of pencils. Many tried to pick two, three or all 10 presidential candidates.
WASHINGTON — One Florida voter penned a plaintive plea on a presidential ballot: "I forgot my glasses and cannot see this. Please put Bush down for my vote."
That Bay County ballot wasn't counted last year. Nor was a Jackson County ballot on which someone had circled Al Gore's name, aimed huge arrows at it and wrote Gore in the "write-in" slot. That voter's mistake: not darkening the oval beside Gore's name.
Floridians wrongly drew stars, circles and Xs on ballots. They used pens instead of pencils, or red ink instead of blue. They tried to erase errors, or fix them with tape or staples. They tried to vote for pro golfer Tiger Woods and Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez. Many tried in vain--and in error--to vote for two, three or even all 10 presidential candidates.
Bizarre ballots, creaky machines, cranky officials and vague laws all contributed to Florida's nightmare election. But a detailed review of 175,010 uncounted ballots by The Times and other media organizations shows how many voters simply messed up.
Researchers from the National Opinion Research Center reviewed 61,190 "undervotes"--ballots rejected by machines or canvassing boards because no clear choice for president was evident. They also inspected 113,820 "overvotes"--ballots tossed aside because more than one presidential candidate appeared to be marked.
A surprising number of people--28,340, or nearly half the undervotes--chose no one for president. A few explained why on the ballot by writing, "None of the above," or even, "Terrible choice!"
But the vast majority of the uncounted ballots suggest people tried to vote. Most, in fact, tried several times.
A Franklin County voter, for example, marked nine of the 10 ovals for president on an optical scan ballot, leaving only the Bush selection blank. Was this voter trying to choose anyone but Bush? Or trying to omit everyone but Bush?
Either way, he or she was not alone: 3,616 uncounted Florida ballots had nine filled ovals and a blank for Bush. And 725 others showed nine filled ovals and a blank for Gore.
Florida law last year required county officials to consider a voter's "intent" when reviewing a disputed ballot but gave little guidance about how to do so. The result: Counties disagreed wildly or even changed rules in mid-count.
Take "double-bubble" votes. Optical-scan tabulating machines automatically rejected paper ballots on which a voter properly darkened an oval by a candidate's name but then filled in a second bubble and wrote in the same name on the ballot in the space for write-in candidates.
Although officials in 34 counties subsequently decided the voter's intent was clear in such cases and counted such votes, officials in at least seven counties did not. The result: 1,344 double-bubble ballots were discarded, with Gore the net loser of as many as 288 valid votes.
Escambia County, a Republican stronghold near the Alabama border, went both ways. County machines rejected double-bubble ballots cast in the precincts, costing Gore as many as 67 votes. But county officials later decided to count the same type of marks as valid on absentee ballots, many from military personnel, who tended to favor Bush.
To ease voting lines and save the cost of extra ballots--at 23 cents apiece--Escambia County officials turned off a counting machine feature that spits out spoiled ballots so voters can correct their mistakes. As a result, 3,680 ballots that were marked more than once were accepted but not counted. However, county officials hand-copied absentee ballots that were torn or not properly marked so that they could be counted. Such actions were legal but show how arbitrary decisions affected the race for the White House.
Some inspected ballots that were rejected by machines. Others inspected only clearly damaged ballots. Some counted absentee ballots without postmarks. Others rejected them. At least two counties put white stickers over obvious mistakes. But as many as two dozen boards declined to examine any of the uncounted ballots.
Twenty-four counties, including the five most populous, used punch card ballots. Most had tiny numbers, but no names, beside pre-cut ballot perforations called chads. The voter was supposed to slide the ballot into a metal sleeve with the candidates' names, then poke out the corresponding chad with a metal stylus. Several counties used a variation with the candidates' names printed beside the chads.
The counties using punch card systems saw the greatest number of spoiled or under-marked ballots--143,235--as voters failed to poke out a chad properly or poked out too many. Some apparently forced ballots upside-down into sleeves. Many ignored the sleeve and poked out chads with no corresponding candidates. Some ignored the stylus and used pens to circle the numbers.
BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan — U.S. troops have destroyed the largest cache of explosives yet found in Afghanistan: hundreds of 500-pound bombs buried in a dry riverbed near Kandahar, the military said Friday.
The cache of 420 air-to-ground bombs was found in the Dori River channel last month, but it took munitions experts weeks to examine the explosives and decide how to proceed, Air Force Maj. Steve Clutter said at Bagram air base, the U.S. military headquarters in Afghanistan.
After evacuating residents, demolition teams used 30,000 pounds of C-4 explosive to destroy the bombs in a single blast Thursday. Army photos of the explosion showed a huge mushroom cloud.
Experts determined that the bombs were not stable enough to be moved and decided to string them together with explosives to destroy them all at once, Army Maj. Richard Patterson said. Troops warned village elders about the demolition, and an aircraft was sent to patrol the area around the blast, he said.
Would you want to watch professional gamers play the games that they are best at? Most people wouldn’t be interested in this kind of voyeurism, but the 50 million people that use Twitch are more than interested in doing just that - watching gamers play. Amazon has just purchased Twitch for a cool $1 billion too, so there’s definitely something to Twitch that many are missing.
Twitch lets gamers film themselves playing various popular video games via live stream. That stream is then shared with the millions of people that use Twitch. Granted, this is a very small and targeted market - mostly competitive gamers - but seeing how a champ plays a game like Dota 2 could mean picking up some important moves.
The other advantage to seeing how competitive gamers play is that Twitch allows competitors to study the competition - much like an NFL team would study the movements of another team. But, why would Amazon want to spend so much money on a company like Twitch?
Amazon has recently started a division called Amazon Game Studios. Amazon’s Game Studios solely makes video games for Fire tablets. Aligning with the Twitch team would mean having a broader audience for various Fire games down the line. There’s another reason why Amazon wants Twitch too - advertising.
Amazon can now advertise to millions of Twitch viewers, and that’s big money for the company. Amazon is looking to compete with Google head-on by purchasing Twitch, since all the ads currently running on Twitch are Google ads, but this won’t be the case for long. According to various resources, Google was actually going to purchase Twitch, but the company pulled out of that race citing something to do with security issues (though some rumours point to the fact that Google couldn’t own Twitch and YouTube due to monopolization issues).
For the most part, Twitch will stay intact, though Amazon will be making some changes to the ad structure and to other parts of the service. The team, format, and other details won’t change. Buying Twitch certainly gives Amazon a strong foothold when it comes to getting in front of online gamers - Google already has YouTube, which is also a popular arena for competitive gaming videos, and now Amazon will have Twitch, which is the second most popular way of checking out gaming video details.
If you do use Twitch currently, you have nothing to really worry about. The ads that Google once ran on the site are now going to be replaced by Amazon ads, but most people won’t notice the difference. As stated, Amazon doesn’t plan to change Twitch around too much, so most of what you already know and love will remain as is. If you haven’t checked out Twitch yet, you can do so by visiting the company’s site - only, now the young startup is owned by Amazon, which payed off well for Twitch developers to say the least.

As Northern eire leaves in the back of a interval of sour violence, a part of the ongoing peace technique specializes in how most sensible to come back to phrases with the pain of the prior. David Park illustrates how one answer may take form by means of inventing a fictional fact fee, modeled on South Africa&apos;s TRC. Revolving round the lives of 4 males who're uncomfortably certain jointly during this communal look for therapeutic, "The fact Commissioner "chronicles the Commission&apos;s first listening to, that of Connor Walshe, a fifteen-year-old Irish Catholic boy who disappeared and whose destiny has remained a secret. 3 males are known as to testify: Francis Gilroy, a newly appointed govt minister and previous IRA chief; retired policeman James Fenton, who recruited Connor as an informer; and Danny, ne Michael Madden, then an eighteen-year previous IRA volunteer, who had fled to the United States, in simple terms to be known as again to Belfast to testify fifteen years later.

The colonel also kept a splendid riding equipage. His stable and carriage-house presented the appearance of some of our large city livery establishments. His horses were of the finest form and noblest blood. His carriage-house contained three splendid coaches, three or four gigs, besides dearborns and barouches of the most fashionable style. Page 26 This establishment was under the care of two slavesold Barney and young Barneyfather and son. To attend to this establishment was their sole work. But it was by no means an easy employment; for in nothing was Colonel Lloyd more particular than in the management of his horses.
Every year brings with it multitudes of this class of slaves. It was doubtless in consequence of a knowledge of this fact, that one great statesman of the south predicted the downfall of slavery by the inevitable laws of population. Whether this prophecy is ever fulfilled or not, it is nevertheless plain that a very different-looking class of people are springing up at the south, and are now held in slavery, from those originally brought to this country from Africa; and if their increase will do no other good, it will do away the force of the argument, that God cursed Ham, and therefore American slavery is right.
Children from seven to ten years old, of both sexes, almost naked, might be seen at all seasons of the year. There were no beds given the slaves, unless one coarse blanket be considered such, and none but the men and women had these. This, however, is not considered a very great privation. They find less difficulty from the want of beds, than from the want of time to sleep; for when their day's work in the field is done, the most of them having their washing, mending, and cooking to do, and having few or none of the ordinary facilities for doing either of these, very many of their sleeping hours are consumed in preparing for the field the coming day; and when this is done, old and young, male and female, married and single, drop down side by side, on one common bed,the cold, damp floor,each covering himself or herself with their miserable blankets; and Page 22 here they sleep till they are summoned to the field by the driver's horn.

There are many different techniques to learn about when caring for your skin. Skin care also means protecting your skin from being damaged by the sun. Sun damage can happen when you do not think about it, and also when you do. The piece that follows is full of tips about preventing sun damage and maintaining the health of your skin.
Give yourself the benefit of the doubt when it comes to your skin care. By switching to taking warm showers instead of hot ones. By doing this you will keep your skin from drying out as a result of being too hot. Dry skin is one of the leading causes of wrinkles and irritation.
In this day and age, there is no excuse for not wearing sunscreen every time you leave the house. Skin cancers have become so prevalent that every man, woman, and child should be protected, even if they’re only going out for a little while. Fortunately, this choice is made very easy for most women, since most facial moisturizers have SPF 15 sunscreen built in. Others, such as Clinique’s City Block, offer an even higher sun protection factor.
A good way to prevent acne is by creating an aspirin mask. Take some uncoated aspirins and crush them while mixing just enough water to create a paste layer. Apply for ten minutes and rinse off. This paste contains salicylic acid from the aspirin which helps clear pores and get rid of acne scars.
Alcohol can have a profound impact on your skin and your overall appearance. If you are going out with your friends, try not to consume too much alcohol as this drink can drain your body of essential fluids and parch your skin. Instead, drink cranberry juice or water as an alternative for healthy skin.
Watercress can help you get rid of any puffy skin or inflammation, it will also reduce pore size. Munching on watercress is great for both your skin and your health in general. Not only will watercress enhance your skins health, the nutrients locked within will also help your body in other ways.
If you are worried about your skin looking damaged, then you should protect yourself from the sun‘s harmful rays by wearing sun screen on a daily basis. People who frequently apply sun screen to their skin have healthier looking skin. It is as simple as applying lotion to your skin once a day.
Boost your skin care with fruits. Research has shown repeatedly that fruits are nature’s miracle cure for acne. Different fruits provide you with different vitamins. Therefore, a cocktail of fruit is your best option to getting rid of greasy skin. Next time you are in the grocery store, take a trip down the fruit isle and get a random selection of sweet treats.
There are many things besides fancy products to consider when it comes to skin care. Your skin needs protecting. Sun damage can be dangerous, protect your skin from the sun. This article has been instrumental in explaining how easy it is to prevent it. By following the advice presented here, you can prevent sun damage and keep your skin healthy and attractive.
"Personality is the glitter that sends your little gleam across the footlights and the orchestra pit into that big black space where the audience is." – Mae West
Last week I posted about the release of 4 new Urban Decay Moondust eyeshadow shades. I've had them in my hot little hands for a few days now so it's time to swatch them all for you!
I went a little crazy during MoYou London's free international shipping promotion and picked up a pretty massive haul of nail stamping plates!
And, before you ask, yes – I have made a map of all the bookshops I want to hit up including City Lights, the Strand and Book of Wonders . . . not to mention I’m going to go crazy at the New York Public Library and Natural History Museum (geek-tour, here I come!).
I also intend to visit the Central Park carousel that Holden Caulfield takes his sister to, get a photo outside the Full House house and try my damndest to get snapped on the Underground New York Public Library (while working hard not to look like I want to be snapped for the Underground New York Public Library. Naturally.)
But that means there will be some blog-silence from Alpha Reader for a couple of weeks. My apologies (. . . but not really cause NEW YORK, BABY!).
While I’m away I shall be delving into Paullina Simons’s epic ‘Tatiana and Alexander’ series – and I hope it lives up to all the hype, chivalry and romance I've been reading about these last few years.
But he has designed the Wife Project, using a sixteen-page questionnaire to help him find the perfect partner. She will most definitely not be a barmaid, a smoker, a drinker, or a late-arriver.
Rosie Jarman is all these things. She is also fiery and intelligent and beautiful. And on a quest of her own to find her biological father—a search that Don, a professor of genetics, might just be able to help her with.
The Wife Project teaches Don some unexpected things. Why earlobe length is an inadequate predictor of sexual attraction. Why quick-dry clothes aren’t appropriate attire in New York. Why he’s never been on a second date. And why, despite your best scientific efforts, you don’t find love: love finds you.
‘The Rosie Project’ by Graeme Simsion is so wonderful; I’m going to attempt to enumerate my enjoyment of the novel;
1. Don Tillman is an Associate Professor of genetics at the University of Melbourne. He has a black-belt in Akikido, and can cook a mean lobster salad. He also has Asperger syndrome – but he doesn’t know that. Don just thinks that there’s something missing that leaves him baffled by human behaviour and unappealing to other people (especially the opposite sex). But after his dear old neighbour tells him that he would make someone a good husband, Don decides to get married – and to limit the fallout of incompatibility and highly ineffective dating detection, Don decides to make a questionnaire to find himself the perfect wife. Thus, ‘The Wife Project’. This is not insane. It has actually happened, to Amy Webb from Baltimore who found her husband by using math and analytics to narrow the dating field.
2. Rosie Jarman is not a potential partner for Don’s Wife Project. She’s a barmaid who is perpetually late and vegetarian. But she is also beautiful and smart. And she’s on her own quest to find someone – her biological father. Rosie has bright red hair, dresses to impress no one but herself and calls em’ like she sees em’. But she is not a ‘Manic Pixie Dream Girl’. She does not want to ‘fix’ Don, she’s tough and imperfect and very aware of her failings. She is one of the best romantic-comedy heroines I've ever read.
3. This scene of Don speed-dating (which I read while on the train, and attracted many curious looks as I snorted my way through it);
‘I've sequenced the questions for maximum speed of elimination,’ I explained. ‘I believe I can eliminate most women in less than forty seconds. Then you can choose the topic of discussion for the remaining time.’
I put the questionnaire away. ‘Excellent.’ I was pleased that my question sequencing was working so well. We could have wasted time talking about ice-cream flavours and make-up only to find that she smoked. Needless to say, smoking was not negotiable. ‘No more questions. What would you like to discuss?’
5. ‘The Rosie Project’ started as a screenplay. Graeme Simsion then decided to turn it into a novel – but still used film-writing techniques and his writing partners were film-industry experts. This is why ‘The Rosie Project’ is destined for the big-screen. The dialogue is so tight and pitch-perfect, the lines just leap up at you and it’s as though characters are speaking from the page. I want to see this film adapted – move over Harry & Sally, it’s all about Don & Rosie!
6. At one point, Don and Rosie travel to New York where, Don says, “being weird is acceptable.” I am going to New York this year. I’m planning an entire day at the Natural History Museum, thanks to Don. I can’t wait!
7. The cover is in-your-face-magnificence. It called to me from the bookshelf, and loudly announced itself to fellow commuters as I read it on the train. I liked this. Very much.
8. Throughout the novel Don starts to question if it’s him that’s missing some vital human-connection component, or if maybe other people are the problem . . . this is encapsulated in the relationship Don has with his best friend and fellow teacher, Gene. Gene is fifty-six and happily married to a beautiful woman with whom he has two children. But Gene’s wife, Claudia, has agreed to an open-marriage and Gene is currently attempting to sleep with a woman from every country. Gene dispenses romantic advice to Don. This is not a good idea, and was a fantastic counter-point to Rosie and Don’s romantic shenanigans.
9. I would actually love a follow-up to ‘The Rosie Project’ because when I got to the last page I immediately missed Don Tillman and wanted him back! But whatever Graeme Simsion decides to write next, I’ll be reading because he’s now an automatic-buy author for me.
10. I could keep going and going and going because I adored ‘The Rosie Project’ (and give it a firm 5/5), but let’s agree that ‘10’ is a good place to stop espousing on all the reasons everyone should read this book (and watch ABC's 'The Book Club' on April 2, because it will be featured!)
For eighteen years, Jude Farraday has put her children’s needs above her own, and it shows—her twins, Mia and Zach—are bright and happy teenagers. When Lexi Baill moves into their small, close knit community, no one is more welcoming than Jude. Lexi, a former foster child with a dark past, quickly becomes Mia’s best friend. Then Zach falls in love with Lexi and the three become inseparable.
Jude does everything to keep her kids safe and on track for college. It has always been easy-- until senior year of high school. Suddenly she is at a loss. Nothing feels safe anymore; every time her kids leave the house, she worries about them.
On a hot summer’s night her worst fears come true. One decision will change the course of their lives. In the blink of an eye, the Farraday family will be torn apart and Lexi will lose everything. In the years that follow, each must face the consequences of that single night and find a way to forget…or the courage to forgive.
Lexi Baill arrives in Washington State to live with her aunt, Eva Lange, in 2000. Lexi has been bounced around many foster homes throughout her childhood, and spent some sporadic years living with her drug-addict mother in between. But now Lexi has found a home and stability with her aunt Eva, living in a little yellow trailer in Port George, Washington.
Jude Farraday is mother to twins Zach and Mia – polar opposites and partners in crime. Mia is shy and reclusive, while Zach is popular and outgoing. The two are best friends, and the pride of Jude’s life. Jude’s doctor husband, Miles, may have a point about her helicopter-parenting and reluctance to cut the apron-strings where the twins are concerned, but Jude’s own childhood was a lonely one cut off from her mother after her father’s death, and she won’t do that to Mia and Zach.
When Mia and Lexi strike up a powerful bond over a shared-love of classic literature, Jude is both relieved and nervous. Lexi brings Mia out of her shell, but Jude is also aware that the Farraday’s have a very different, privileged life to that of Lexi and her aunt . . . then there’s the fact that Mia has been hurt in the past, when her girlfriends developed crushes on Zach, and abandoned Mia for him.
But Mia and Lexi prove to have a bond that’s almost as strong as the one Mia and Zach have – and for three years they are the best of friends . . . until one night changes everything. Zach is left an only-child, Jude is cut adrift and Lexi takes on the burden of blame – and none of them will ever be the same again.
This novel is just awful. I hated reading it – all the characters irked me, and some of them made me want to reach into the story and throttle them. But I kept reading because I wanted to know how it would end. . . this book is, literally, like a McDonalds meal that you start feeling guilty about from the first bite but you can’t stop yourself from finishing all of it.
We begin in 2000, when Lexi arrives at Port George and strikes up a friendship with Mia and is welcomed into the Farraday bosom by Jude. The first few pages introduce us to Lexi – a young girl who has had an unfair share of heartache in her short life. Between foster homes and witnessing her mother’s decline (more than once) her arrival in Port George to live with her unknown Aunt Eva is the first really good thing to happen to Lexi, possibly in her whole life.
Then we’re introduced to Jude – who is panicking about her kid’s first day of high school. She’s worried that Mia won’t make friends, and she’s concerned about the kind of friends Zach will make . . . yep, Jude is one of those parents. Meeting Jude and the Farraday family after having first met Lexi is rather jarring – even more so when Jude goes over the floor-plan of their massive manor-home (the kids have the entire first floor to themselves – including a gaming room.) Straight away, I was on Lexi’s side and more invested in her story and narrative voice. I’ll always root for the underdog, and compared to the obnoxious wealth of the Farraday’s, Lexi is an extreme-underdog
Then the timeline of this story starts getting a little skewed . . . we jump ahead from 2000 to three years later (right in an odd place too, Hannah snaps forward right before we’re about to read Jude, Mia and Lexi start bonding on a girl’s outing).
The next little chunk of timeline concerns Lexi and Zach’s developing feelings for one another in their senior year of high school – something they have to hide from Mia because she’s so fragile after having one friend in the past hook-up and break-up with her brother that has apparently scarred her for life. Geez. You know things aren’t good when you give characters nicknames in your head – Mia was ‘needy-psycho’ to me. This girl just grated – though I think Hannah meant to portray her as a sweet, innocent soul who needed looking after . . . I just read ‘whiny’. This section of story also concerns Lexi working round-the-clock at an ice-cream shop to try and scrape enough money together to go to a small state school, while Mia and Zach are struggling to decide between USC, Yale, Stanford . . . and of course dominating parent, Jude, is stressing right along with them. When Lexi’s Aunt Eva contemplates dipping into her life-savings to help Lexi go to a four-year school, I officially wanted to smack every Farraday character over the head, repeatedly.
Now, a huge let-down of this book is the supposed "soul-mate" romance of Zach and Lexi – which is meant to cover all manner of ills and explain a lot, later in the story. It doesn’t help that Zach is written a little too true-to-life as a teenage boy who says not a whole lot. Seriously – when Hannah pulls the “he’s in love with her!” card I was sitting there thinking ‘Really? How can you tell? The boy does not talk!’ Actually, Zach suffers the same fate as his father, Miles, in that neither male character does or says a whole lot. The men in this story feel depleted and sidelined, completely overpowered by the women despite them all going through the same losses and traumas. This is especially bad for Jude’s story – I might have warmed to her if she had been a well-rounded woman but she is literally labelled MOTHER and not much else. Her marriage, despite going through the biggest trauma any relationship can experience, is just back-burner to her being a mother (and then a mother who loses a child). She gardens, but that’s really her only discernible characteristic. She has her own mother-issues, but they’re anaemic and not at all an excuse for her being such a one-dimensional mother-cyborg. I get that this is the point of ‘Night Road’ – here is a woman who sees herself as a mother and nothing else, and what happens when that’s (partly) taken away from her? Well, that’s boring to me. Jude is the book-equivalent of all those people in my Facebook feed who only post photos and updates about their kids and nothing else – as if they weren’t really alive until they had offspring. Blergh.
The second-half of the story jumps ahead to 2010 and concerns everyone’s fate after the tragic accident that kills Mia . . . and lays blame entirely (unfairly) at Lexi’s feet.
Now, if this had been a Jodi Picoult novel, you can bet this would have been the point that the story started. Because this is the most interesting portion of the whole book – everything else that came before; setting up Mia & Zach’s twin-dynamic, Jude’s helicopter parenting, the kids growing, Lexi & Zach’s romance . . . all that was just boring filler. Part-two of the story, which starts at page 241 of this 385-page book, is where the whole thing should have started from (with some backtracking of story origin). Here is where Hannah pulls out questions of morality, forgiving, guilt and redemption.
Jude just gets worse. Maybe I was meant to feel sympathy for her – but I have little sympathy for those determined to be victims and wallow in their own pain while blaming and punishing others for their state of being.
“Most patients want to learn how to live. They want me to make a map that they can follow to get them to a healthy future. You simply just want to survive each day.”
“It’s the way it is.” Jude crossed her arms. “Look, you’ve helped me, if that’s what this is about. Maybe you think I should be doing better by now, maybe you think six years is a long time. But it’s not, not when your child died. And I am doing better. I grocery shop. I cook dinner. I go out with girlfriends. I make love to my husband. I vote.”
I cannot, for the life of me, tell you why I didn’t chuck this book away about 20 pages into it. But I think I was looking forward to the skip-ahead portion, when we get to the meat of the morality-story. And, honestly, I did race to read that last half (though it left me utterly unsatisfied). Hannah rushes the ending, and what could actually take up an entire 300+ pages is watered-down with happily-ever-after shenanigans and unbelievable resolutions.
I know that popular-fiction writers get a bad rep. Their books are seen as nothing more substantial than fairy-floss . . . but, by God!, there are nuances within this genre. Someone like Jodi Picoult can have me enraptured in a couple of chapters, and I’ll finish one of her books a weeping-wreck, but completely satisfied. Then you read someone like Kristin Hannah who writes despicable characters like Jude (I’m convinced we were meant to like her) and waffles on for 280-pages writing absolute filler rubbish – only to leave the actual meat of the story for the last 100 rushed pages. But, you know, I can only blame myself for this one – I knew it was bad after the first chapter, but I kept punishing myself and reading it. Fool me once.
Paul isn't thinking clearly. He's destroying everything that's important to him, and when he finally hurts the one person he cares about most, he runs away . . .
Maybe it started back in Woollongong, when Paul’s mum packed them up and ran away from his dad . . . that was when Paul learnt to start letting things go. Even things he loved. They were on the run throughout Paul’s childhood, his mum forever paranoid that they’d one day bump into his old man, and Paul would be taken away from her.
And then one day they stopped running and returned to Woollongong. Because his dad was dead, and nobody was looking for them, for him.
Now fresh out of high school Paul’s life is going nowhere. He does drug drop-offs for his flatmates' older brother, and is slowly crawling towards addiction himself.
His one constant in life is his grandma, Hetty, his dad’s mum. After returning to Woollongong as a young boy he remembered the way to her house, and has been regularly dropping in on her ever since (without his mum knowing). Hetty gave Paul his most prized possession – his dad’s old guitar, and she is probably his favourite person in the world. She’s definitely one of the few remaining people who trust Paul, who haven’t cut him off.
But all that’s about to change, because Paul has just made the worst mistake of his life. There’s no going back, the only way is down.
Don’t be fooled by this slim, 174-page book. This is not an easy read, nor should it be. Howe is exploring addiction; the spiralling destruction of addicts and those around them as we watch Paul sink lower and lower to rock bottom. This book is hard to read, and Howe writes beautifully and eloquently about something that is very, very ugly.
The book is told in third-person, a narration that is sadly unique to young adult books these days, but is perfectly attuned to this story in which Paul is so far removed from his life and actions that there’s no way he could tell this story himself. And it helps that there’s a bit of distance from the story– allowing Howe to give some cold details and illicit that horrified-bystander response from readers.
Howe delivers wonderful characterization in this nuanced story. The real trigger of Paul’s spiral is when he sells his father’s old guitar . . . it’s a small, material thing, but it bleeds into the larger story of how Paul was forced to abandon his father, and what it did to him when he had to stop hoping to ever be reunited;
Paul had spent whole afternoons waiting in the yard of each place they’d lived in up the coast, hoping his dad would find them. Every time they went to a new beach he’d scan the carpark, searching for his dad’s ute just in case. Once he thought he saw him in the surf, but when the tiny wetsuited figure paddled for a wave and stood up, urging the board across the face, he could tell it wasn’t him. After that, he stopped looking. The thought had knotted in the back of his mind, curling around on itself like a great tangle of fishing line – maybe his dad didn’t want to come back.
This is a story that’s set on quite a grey-scale. Paul is a loathsome human being for much of the book, but Howe also shows us explanations for his character. His mother took him and ran – she was driven by a paranoid need to keep her son and keep him on her side – but when she settled down into her second marriage, she all but forgot about Paul. He was a vulnerable young boy, and easy pickings for bad people who now control him through his addiction. ‘Song in the Dark’ is a story of many sides – and Howe doesn’t let any of her characters off the hook, or ever let readers think that their morality is black and white.
This is a tough book, and so it should be. Howe will challenge young readers as she explores the spiral of addiction, the complexity of betrayal and the fragility of hope. This is a raw and beautiful book, a stunning literary debut.
This week I read and loved Kate Forsyth's new book 'The Wild Girl'. A beautiful, epic love story about the power of stories and dreams. Forsyth takes the tales we've all grown up knowing by heart, and shows us how little we actually understand of their origins and meaning - to show us that sometimes, stories are more about the telling than the tale. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Q: Are you a ‘plotter’ or a ‘pantser’ - that is, do you meticulously plot your novel before writing, or do you ‘fly by the seat of your pants’ and let the story evolve naturally?
I use both methods, to be honest. In the early stages, as I'm daydreaming about the book and beginning to see my way clear, I very much trust the story to evolve naturally in my imagination. I do a lot of research and jot down lots of thoughts, images and ideas, and try to get a sense of my characters and so forth. I then begin to plan my story, but again in a very natural and intuitive way. I cannot start writing until I have the novel's title and my first line, and a clear sense of where the story is going. I also like to know how its going to end, and a number of important scenes along the way. As I begin to write, I will discover more about the story and its shape will become clear to me. Then I usually write very swiftly, holding it all together in my mind. New ideas will come, earlier ideas will be abandoned, the story will knit itself together ... and I really love that process.
It took quite a few years, but that's mainly because I was working on my novel BITTER GREENS during those years too. The idea came to me because of research I was doing for that novel, and so I had to wait till it was done and I had the space and time clear to really begin to work on THE WILD GIRL. The research was intensive, so that took absolute ages. Once that was all done, the actual writing took me about nine months to a year.
Q: Where do story ideas generally start for you? Do you first think of the character, theme, ending? Or is it just a free-fall?
I always begins with the story, and it grows from there. Usually the idea comes to me in a flash, and then I get all excited . I get more ideas than I can ever write, though, and it can be quite hard to put the idea away and keep focusing on the job in hand. I tend to write the idea down in a notebook, put it away in my bottom drawer, and then go back to the novel I'm meant to be writing.
Q: You had me from the Foreword with this book, when you point out that the Brothers Grimm were men in their 20s, living during the time of Napoleon and Jane Austen. I had never thought of them that way, and I wonder if you can remember when you first had the light bulb moment about the Grimms? And I wonder if that realization was also the moment that you decided to dig deeper and make a story out of them?
When I was researching the origin of 'Rapunzel' in the early stages of working on BITTER GREENS, I read a book called 'Clever Maids: The Secret History of the Grimm's Fairy Tales'. That was my lightbulb moment - it was when I first discovered the romance between Wilhelm Grimm and Dortchen Wild, the girl who lived next door, and the first time I realised so much about the Grimms, and their background, and the sources of their stories. I knew at once I had to write a novel about them.
Q: You touch on your research in this book, in the Afterword when you talk about reading personal letters, memoirs and diary entries of the key players but also psychologist studies and writings from fairy tale scholars (not to mention your research on the Napoleonic wars!). How much research did you accumulate in the writing of this exquisitely detailed book – and was there any factoid or interesting insight that you had to leave out, but would like to share with us?
The research took me a long time, because I knew nothing whatsoever about the Napoleonic Wars, or Germany in the early 19th century, and almost nothing about the Grimm Brothers. 'Clever Maids' only mentions Dortchen briefly and I had to do a whole lot of digging up to discover anything more about her. I loved the research, though - it was fascinating. And of course there were many things I could not use, because they did not touch upon my narrative. I'd have loved to have had Napoleon as a character, for example, but he never came to Hessen-Cassel, the small town where Wilhelm and Dortchen lived, and so I had to leave him out.
Q: There’s something rather feminist about the Brothers Grimm, looking back on it. As you say in your Afterword “more than half of the tales were actually contributed by educated, middle-class young ladies of their acquaintance.” To think that all those infamous stories were passed down and recited by women, it’s a rather nice thought (even if most people attribute them entirely to the Brothers). You’ve certainly written Dortchen Wild as this strong, female character who triumphs over adversity just as the heroines in the stories she tells Wilhelm. Did you think it’s rather sad that the role women played in shaping the Brothers Grimm is fairly unknown? And is that partly what inspired you to write this book?
Oh yes, that was definitely one of my purposes in writing the novel. I'm drawn to the stories of amazing women who have been forgotten by history.
I'll pick three! 'Rapunzel', 'Six Swans', and 'The Leaping, Lilting Lark', which is a variant of 'Beauty and the Beast' that Dortchen tells Wilhelm. I'd never heard it before and its very beautiful.
I'm working on a 5-book fantasy adventures series for kids aged 9-12. It comes out in late 2014. Then I'll write another adult historical novel, set in Nazi Germany, that retells 'The Leaping, Lilting Lark'.
One of the great untold love stories - how the Grimm brothers discovered their famous fairy tales - filled with drama and passion, and taking place during the Napoleonic Wars.
The Wild Girl tells the story of Dortchen Wild. Growing up next door to the Grimm brothers in Hesse-Cassel, a small German kingdom, Dortchen told Wilhelm some of the most powerful and compelling stories in the famous fairytale collection.
Dortchen first met the Grimm brothers in 1805, when she was twelve. One of six sisters, Dortchen lived in the medieval quarter of Cassel, a town famous for its grand royal palace, its colossal statue of Herkules, and a fairytale castle of turrets and spires built as a love nest for the Prince-Elector's mistress. Dortchen was the same age as Lotte Grimm, the only girl in the Grimm family, and the two became best friends.
In 1806, Hesse-Cassel was invaded by the French. Napoleon created a new Kingdom of Westphalia, under the rule of his dissolute young brother Jérôme. The Grimm brothers began collecting fairytales that year, wanting to save the old stories told in spinning-circles and by the fire from the domination of French culture. Dortchen was the source of many of the tales in the Grimm brother's first collection of fairy tales, which was published in 1812, the year of Napoleon's disastrous march on Russia.
Dortchen's own father was cruel and autocratic, and he beat and abused her. He frowned on the friendship between his daughters and the poverty-stricken Grimm Brothers. Dortchen had to meet Wilhelm in secret to tell him her stories. All the other sisters married and moved away, but Dortchen had to stay home and care for her sick parents. Even after the death of her father, Dortchen and Wilhelm could not marry – the Grimm brothers were so poor they were surviving on a single meal a day.
After the overthrow of Napoleon and the eventual success of the fairytale collection, Dortchen and Wilhelm were at last able to marry. They lived happily ever after with Wilhelm's elder brother Jakob for the rest of their lives.
A margins note appears in the personal copy of Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm’s ‘Hänsel und Grethel’ – which reveals that in 1813 Henriette Dorothea (Dortchen) Wild contributed the children's verse answer to the witch, "The wind, the wind,/ The heavenly child," which rhymes in German: "Der Wind, der Wind,/ Das himmlische Kind." It is likely that the Grimms heard the entire story in the Wild household.
In ‘The Wild Girl’, Kate Forsyth delivers a breathtakingly epic historic romance that imagines the relationship between Wilhelm Grimm and Dortchen Wild – set against the Napoleonic Wars and during a time of great hardship and uncertainty for the German people.
Most people imagine the brothers as elderly men in medieval costume, travelling around the countryside asking for tales from old women bent over their spinning wheels, or wizened shepherds tending their flocks. The truth is that they were young men in their twenties, living at the same time as Jane Austen and Lord Byron.
This was the moment Forsyth hooked me. Because I was one of those people who must have had too many heavy doses of Hollywood, and was thinking of the Brothers Grimm as hobbled old men, something like Merlin-figures rather than real people. To think that they were young men, living during war-time completely reshaped my perception of them – and was a fantastic leaping-off point to begin ‘The Wild Girl’. Forsyth has created a mesmerizingly detailed historical reimagining of the Grimm’s and their journey to storytelling, not unlike Philippa Gregory or, dare I say, Hilary Mantel (if she ever turned away from tales of the monarchy.)
This is a very long book (coming in at 533-pages) but that’s because Forsyth is covering the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) as well as Wilhelm and Dortchen’s rocky road to happily-ever-after (the book begins in 1805, but they weren’t married until 1825). And Forsyth has not skimped on any details concerning the war or in building Jakob and Wilhelm’s characters – she explores Wilhelm as a life-long asthma sufferer, and covers the death of Admiral Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar (news of which is reported second-hand to the German citizens, who are desperate for news of Napoleon’s movements and their impending invasion). All of which leads to creating a storm around the Grimm’s hometown of Hesse-Kassel in Hanau, which was invaded by France in 1807. Forsyth really highlights how the Napoleonic Wars went a long way to informing the Brother’s path in life – when a new French Government makes Jakob and Wilhelm’s law studies null and void, the brothers start taking their collection of stories seriously for alternate income, and because of a sense of Germanic patriotism.
History geek that I am, I loved Forsyth’s attention to historic detail and her own imaginings and interpretations on how circumstance shaped two of the most famous storytellers in history. The most I knew of the Brother Grimm and their tales was how they were anglicized versions of fables that had roots in many different countries and cultures. Like ‘Cinderella’ having threads of a Chinese Duan Chengshi story, or being somewhat similar to a Philippine tale called ‘Mariang Alimango’. But reading ‘The Wild Girl’ puts a very interesting spin on this idea that the Brothers Grimm pillaged and plundered exotic tales and made them their own – it’s remarkable to think that while modern naysayers would have us believe the brothers tried an ‘Anglicisation’, in actual fact by collecting stories they were merely trying to preserve their own Germanic culture against Napoleon’s French empire.
But ‘The Wild Girl’ is far from a history lesson. No, the real heart of this book is in Wilhelm and Dortchen’s romance, which begins when Dortchen is twelve-years-old and develops a small crush on the handsome Grimm brother;
. . . but love has never been something that can be constrained by age. It happened in the way of old tales, in an instant, changing everything forever. It was a fork in the path, the turn of a key, the kindling of a lantern.
Dortchen is one of six Wild sisters, just as the Grimm family have six children (five boys and one girl, Lotte, who is Dortchen’s best friend). Dortchen’s father is the local apothecary, and a tyrannical man incapable of expressing love but quick with a beating for minor disobedience - he can easily be believed as the archetype of every witch/Bluebeard villain. As Napoleon closes in, times become harder and harder in Hesse-Kassel and both the Wild and Grimm families suffer. And as Dortchen and Wilhelm get older and realize their love for one another, the more it seems these are not the times for happy endings.
She sighed and tried once more to draw away. He gripped her forearms and said, in a low, intense voice, ‘I've been reading Novalis. Do you remember? He said the most beautiful thing about love. It’s given me new faith, Dortchen.’
‘Love works magic,’ Wilhelm said. ‘It is the final purpose of the world story, the “Amen” of the universe.’
She caught her breath in a sob and reached up to kiss him. For a long moment, the world stilled around them.
But Forsyth has looked beyond impoverished times and political upheaval as the reason for Dortchen and Wilhelm’s prolonged courtship. Just as every good Grimm tale contains a truly heinous villain, so too does ‘The Wild Girl’ – and this, I’m afraid, is a tale as old as time. Forsyth handles Dortchen’s story of abuse with tender care, and though there is no factual evidence to support Forsyth’s imaginings, her Afterword certainly lays down strong reasoning in the disturbing stories Dortchen told the Brothers Grimm.
Kate Forsyth’s ‘The Wild Girl’ is a remarkable tale that beautifully blends fact and fiction. It is a sweeping historical romance that will appeal to both adults and young adults, as it reminds us the power of storytelling and loving, even in the hardest of times.
I have a new column up at Kill Your Darlings, in which I call for the ABC's Book Club to start featuring young adult titles.
It's one thing to learn to curtsy properly. It's quite another to learn to curtsy and throw a knife at the same time. Welcome to finishing school.
Sophronia is a great trial to her poor mother. Sophronia is more interested in dismantling clocks and climbing trees than proper manners-and the family can only hope that company never sees her atrocious curtsy. Mrs. Temminnick is desperate for her daughter to become a proper lady. So she enrolls Sophronia in Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality.
But Sophronia soon realizes the school is not quite what her mother might have hoped. At Mademoiselle Geraldine's young ladies learn to finish. . . everything. Certainly, they learn the fine arts of dance, dress, and etiquette, but they also learn to deal out death, diversion, and espionage - in the politest possible ways, of course. Sophronia and her friends are in for a rousing first year's education.
Some people see a dumbwaiter – Sophronia Temminnick sees a means to spy on her mother and the mystery lady called Mademoiselle Geraldine whom she’s taking tea with. And in the course of her spying, Sophronia learns that the entire Temminnick has had its fill of her wild ways and tomboyish tomfoolery – now they are desperate for her to go away to a finishing school. And there is no finer school than Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality.
Fourteen-year-old Sophronia is being carted away to become a lady – a thought she finds absolutely abhorrent. But from the moment she climbs into a beautiful carriage, she begins to suspect that she’s going to get a very different education to the one she, and her mother, initially thought. . .
She is introduced to fellow schoolmate, the dainty Dimity Ann Pllumleigh-Teignmott who has a family legacy at the Academy. Along for the carriage ride to school is Dimity’s younger brother, Pillover – who attends a Boys' Polytechnique where he’s training to be an evil genius. And then there are the unplanned travel companions - the Flywaymen who attack from above. They demand something called “the prototype”, and in the course of a quite vexing combat, Mademoiselle Geraldine is revealed to be not the actual Mademoiselle Geraldine but an Academy student sent on assignment called Miss Monique de Pelouse.
With the help of three novice students, and thanks to Sophronia’s ingenious, the Flywaymen are fought off and the foursome continues on to school . . . but the damnable Flywaymen are not forgotten, nor is this ‘prototype’ they were willing to die for.
When Sophronia gets to the Finishing Academy, she finds it is in fact a floating dirigible – constantly moving and requiring the help of a leaping werewolf (also a teacher at the school) called Captain Niall to board.
Now begins the real adventure – for this finishing school is unlike any other. Sophronia meets her roommates - Sidheag and Agatha, and unfortunately the senior student Monique de Pelouse who takes it upon herself to become Sophronia’s nemesis. Academy teachers include werewolves and vampires. And lessons include; History of social discourse, dancing, drawing, music, dress and modern languages, Fine Arts of Death, Diversion and the Modern Weaponries, the proper way to flutter eyelashes and the art of fainting.
When Sophronia manages to sneak her (steam-powered) mechanimal pet, Bumbersnoot, onboard the floating school, his dietary requirement of coal has Sophronia venturing into the belly of the dirigible and meeting the ‘sooties’ – including one handsome boy called Soap and his little friend, Vieve (short for Genevieve Lefoux!) who is mechanical-obsessed.
It’s a good thing Sophronia is learning a lot at this Finishing Academy (like a proper curtsey and how to fall into a pretend dead-faint) because the Flywaymen are back, and when Sophronia and her friends find out exactly what the ‘prototype’ is . . . she realizes they really will do whatever it takes to find it.
‘Etiquette & Espionage’ is the first book in Gail Carriger’s new young adult steampunk series, ‘Finishing School’, which is a spin-off and set in the same universe as her adult ‘Parasol Protectorate’ series (and includes a few lovely cameos for real crossover-power!).
I was a couple of pages into ‘Etiquette & Espionage’ when it hit me that this book reads exactly like Carriger’s adult series . . . and how absolutely wonderful that is! I think it’s the highest compliment to pay an adult fiction writer who crosses-over to the young adult readership, that their books lose nothing of the flavour and sass of their adult series – it’s a sign that they’ve dumbed nothing down, have retained their distinct voice and proven the versatility of their universe. Of course, I can imagine younger reader having to look up words like ‘dirigible’ and ‘prevarication’ – but, in all honesty, when I first started reading the ‘Parasol Protectorate’ series I had to get used to the steampunk-lingo and look words up too! The highfalutin language is intricate to Carriger’s steampunk world of Victorian England, and if kids have to look up words in a dictionary – that’s a good thing, not a hindrance!
Carriger’s language and narrative voice is as scrumptious as ever in this new series. She’ll throw out passages like this one, that are just melt-in-your-mouth perfection;
He was very pale and boasted an unassuming moustache, which was perched atop his upper lip cautiously, as though it were slightly embarrassed to be there and would like to slide away and become a sideburn or something more fashionable.
That level of characterisation and description is perfect in a young adult series, and it really brings this world to life. Everything from the floating dirigible school to mechanimal Bumbersnoot is intricate and fabulous – setting up a fascinating stage.
Sophronia is one of the best new female protagonists on the young adult scene – hands down. She’s rough and tumble, loyal and inquisitive – and has so much room to grow as a fourteen-year-old sleuth-in-training. Although ‘sleuth’ isn’t quite right – in fact, the girls training at Mademoiselle Geraldine's Finishing Academy for Young Ladies of Quality can be anything they want, so well-rounded is their training.
She had to give her teachers credit: they were right to insist all pupils carry scissors, handkerchiefs, perfume and hair ribbons at all times. At some point she'd learn why they also required a red lace doily and a lemon.
The book-cover quote is from Marie Lu, who calls it “the perfect steampunk version of Harry Potter” – which irks me a tiny little bit. I know people have just replaced ‘magic’ with ‘steampunk’ and said it’s Hermione instead of Harry – but Gail Carriger has such a unique voice (and is a steampunk predecessor!) it’s just sort of insulting to reduce her to a JK Rowling writealike.
This is a refreshing new series with a female protagonist young readers can cheer on and look up to – she comes with a cast of fascinating friends who will no doubt keep this universe extremely colourful and interesting. ‘Finishing School’ is set 25-years before Carriger’s original adult ‘Parasol Protectorate’ series, but both new and old fans will want to leap onboard this new thrill-ride!
This week my copy of ‘Girl Defective’ arrived and I consumed it in one train trip (this is like an informal rating system for me: read in one train trip = one amazing book). Simmone Howell definitely delivers on the YA benchmarks she set with her debut ‘Notes from the Teenage Underground’ and ‘EverythingBeautiful’.
‘Girl Defective’ is the Something Wild with Street Crazies, and it’s Some Weird Sin how much I loved this book ;)
P.S. – if you want to know what the animal-head pictures are all about . . . get to the mess and read the book!
I am a bit of both. I always have an idea of where I want the story to go and I'll have a few key scenes in mind when I start, but if I go off track I don't mind because that's usually where the story gets more interesting - I think of it like a discovery walk where you know the start and finish but how you get there can change because of a road accident or a whim ...
I had started a St Kilda novel (called for a long time St Kilda novel) which was a version of Notes from the Teenage Underground back in 2004 - so some seeds were planted then... but GD has pretty much been at the forefront of my consciousness since 2008 where I wrote the first chapter that featured Sky and Nancy on the rooftop looking at the palm trees and throwing food at passers-by.
Character and situation. But it is a free-fall too. And sometimes the characters you think are going to be important become less so and vice versa. My themes don't change too much from book to book (I think. Generally.) With GD I wanted to try and write a crime novel but it quickly became obvious that my inner writer didn't want to be tied to crime-writing conventions, so there was a battle of wills for a while there.
I love writing young characters because I feel like they have more dreams and possibilities. I know this isn't actually true, but it's always a starting point. I also think a lot about what makes people the way they are, and my characters are kind of a study of humanity (on a very small scale). I don't think too much about the genre as I'm writing. Labels work when they work. But I do read a lot of YA and my favourite books could easily fit into this genre if you skewed the definition a tad.
Q: So, I see from your bio that among the many casual jobs you’ve worked in your life (portable animal farms among them?!) you also once worked in a record shop. Sky, the protagonist of ‘Girl, Defective’ works in her family record shop. How did you go drawing on your own record shop-girl experiences for this book – and have you had this story fermenting in your mind since your shop days?
I have worked in lots of record shops - old fusty ones and shiny desperate ones - and I have always wanted to write a novel set in one. I love the reverence of vinyl fans and the humour and the strange combination of irritation and fondness you can have for the more challenging regular customer. My first proper job was at a second-hand record shop. I had dropped out of uni but have to say I got a better education at the shop than what the course would have offered me.
Q: You’re a Melburnian, and ‘Girl, Defective’ is set in St. Kilda (Sky’s record shop being on Blessington Street – one of the best named streets in Australia!). All Melbourne locals know that St. Kilda holds special affection and fascination (with a nefarious) history. When I first read the synopsis for ‘Girl, Defective’ and read about the St. Kilda setting – I was thrilled and totally got the appeal. But can you explain the appeal of St. Kilda for those who don’t know the area – explain why you wanted your story set in this suburb?
I grew up in the outer east and St Kilda was always this mythical dreamland to me. It is a place that's already full of stories and I guess I wanted to add to the layers. It has a reputation of being a place of edges and art and criminal activity and because it has a transience, the mood is always shifting. It seems to me to be like a place where people come to rather than from ... It has a well-documented history (and I recommend the St Kilda Historical society's walks - they are fascinating) and I love all the metaphors of it beginning as a swamp, then becoming a rich person's playground, then falling into disrepair and then becoming gentrified. Back when I lived there I was in a duplex that had a Sai Baba devotee on one side and lunatic living in the shed out the back. PLus it's physically beautiful - the sea and the wide streets, the Spanish houses & the eerie canal!
Q: Family is quite a focus in this book – between Sky’s patriarch and her brother – the intense focus is beautifully summarised in the synopsis; ‘Family Rules’. So often in YA books, family units are pushed to the side and are non-existent or cardboard cutouts. In young adult literature it’s usually the friendship family that is the real heart. Why was family an important exploration for you in this book, and for Sky?
I think the relationships in the book are a mirror of the important people in my life at the time of writing. I wanted to explore the themes of how families can stay together when they are so challenged, so at odds with their environment...
The Member of the Wedding by Carson McCullers, Wild at Heart by Barry Gifford, The Slide Area by Gavin Lambert
We, the Martin family, were like inverse superheroes, marked by our defects. Dad was addicted to beer and bootlegs. Gully had "social difficulties" that manifested in his wearing a pig snout mask 24-7. I was surface clean but underneath a weird hormonal stew was simmering...
It's summer in St Kilda. Fifteen-year-old Sky is looking forward to great records and nefarious activities with Nancy, her older, wilder friend. Her brother – Super Agent Gully – is on a mission to unmask the degenerate who bricked the shop window. Bill the Patriarch seems content to drink while the shop slides into bankruptcy. A poster of a mysterious girl and her connection to Luke, the tragi-hot new employee sends Sky on an exploration into the dark heart of the suburb. What begins as a toe-dip into wilder waters will end up changing the frames of Sky's existence. Love is strange. Family Rules. In between there are teenage messes, rock star spawn, violent fangirls, creepy old guys and accidents waiting to happen. If the world truly is going to hell in a hand-basket then at least the soundtrack is kicking. Sky Martin is Girl Defective: funny, real and dark at the edges.
Mia Casey’s graffiti face with blackened tears watches over Bill's Wishing Well record shop. Mia was a real girl who died a few months ago, found face-down in the river and thought to be a ‘party-girl’ – no investigations are underway.
Skylark ‘Sky’ Martin thinks about Mia, even dreams about her. But Sky has enough to worry about without deluding herself into thinking she knew a dead girl . . .
For one thing, her dad is the Bill who owns Bill's Wishing Well record shop. Her dad can polish off a whole slab in a single sitting and long ago accepted his alcoholism as a permanent character flaw. Then there’s Sky’s little brother, Gully, who never takes off the pig-snout mask their mum sent him for his last birthday. And speaking of Sky’s mum – what’s the point? She changed her name to Galaxy and breezed off to perform installation art in Japan, and now she’s just a voice on the end of the phone.
But life isn’t all bad for soon-to-be-sixteen Sky. There’s Nancy; their failed cleaner turned only best friend Sky has ever known. Nancy is older and wilder; she’s a dream of a girl who can pull of wearing the vintage clothes Sky’s mum left behind and causes eyes to bug out of people’s heads.
Home is Blessington Street in St. Kilda – where tourists outnumber locals and nobody but Sky and Gully are born and bred St. Kildans. Locals are a colourful bunch and frequent the record shop – there’s the Weird Sisters and The Fugg (a poet), Steve Sharp (once famous, now sober) and Mystery Train.
It’s Mia Casey’s graffiti face that ignites everything – or so it seems. She’s plastered on the wall and suddenly bricks are flying, mysterious white vans are peeling away and a pretty newbie called Luke is hired at Wishing Well. Suddenly Sky’s life becomes full and messy – and glorious.
It has been too long since we’ve had a Simmone Howell novel. ‘Everything Beautiful’ was her last, and that was 2008. The moment I started reading ‘Girl Defective’ and Howell’s cracking voice rang out from the page – that was when I knew something (or, rather, someone) had been sadly missed on the Aussie YA scene. Howell writes such sharp characters and dark edges with a wry humour that’s wholly unique and breathtaking. Reading her latest offering is like gulping air you didn’t know was cut off – and I hope we never have to go so long between instalments from Ms Howell.
The novel is set in St. Kilda, Howell’s stomping ground. For those who don’t know, St. Kilda is a suburb of Melbourne and is one of the city’s more colourful areas. It has quite a past – back in the 1880’s the area experienced a land boom and because St. Kilda is overlooking Port Philip Bay, it became a seaside destination. But the depression bought a sharp decline to the area, and for many years it was a place for crooks, prostitutes and general low-lives. It was only in the 1990s that the area experienced a gentrification, and as ‘Girl Defective’ is set in the present, Sky observes that: “These days the red light still glowed but only faintly.” So St. Kilda is a real dichotomy – some areas are still imprints of the suburb’s seedy past, but there are oak-lined streets that are beyond posh and full of million-dollar properties.
I love the St. Kilda setting; for one thing it becomes a distinct character within Sky’s story, and for another it seems to be a reflection of the Martin family and associates. Father Bill is definitely living in the past (encapsulated in his record shop’s motto – “nothing after 1995”) while Sky’s best friend, Nancy, is determined to look forward and keep her eyes off the rear-view mirror. And as for Sky . . . well, she seems to be caught between the vibrancy of those around her. With a post-punk father and mother called Galaxy, a brother who is a detective-in-training and constantly snouted, not to mention Nancy’s silver magnetism – Sky constantly feels like the odd one out. She’s mostly friendless at school, prefers masculine clothing and is quietly observant. It’s no wonder that amidst so many fiery characters and temperaments, Sky doesn’t quite know where she fits in, what her ‘thing’ is or who 'her people' are. I love her. Quiet she may be, but Sky is wicked smart and eloquent. She’s such a wonderfully relatable character; constantly feeling like the sidekick or back-up singer is something many, many people can relate to. And Howell has given Sky quite a voice – I adore how she describes her tinging jealousy of Nancy’s shine;
Howell’s writing is magnificent – and my copy of ‘Girl Defective’ is peppered with markers to remember all the fine lines that caught me unawares. Howell’s similes alone made my knees weak;
This is, ultimately, a book about relationships. There’s a focus on family – of the parents who vamoose and those who stick around. Little brothers we want to cradle and protect, and the sisters we let slip away. The flimsy friendships we hope to blossom into permanency, and the tentative lust that catches us unawares. And then there’s the relationship we have to music – what Sky calls her ‘valve’ on life. Music is an outlet, a private ceremony and those in the book feel a deep connection to the soundtrack of their lives;
To some eyes this could look like a test. The first track a newbie played might set the tone for his employment. Luke was right to look uncertain. He wandered around the aisles for ages, coming back with Simon & Garfunkel.
‘Sky – don’t psychoanalyse the new guy.’ Dad turned to Luke. ‘Gully reads faces, Sky reads records. We, the Martins, have superpowers.’
Simmone Howell slays me, every damn time. I didn’t want this book to end, and now that it’s over I just want to climb back into Howell’s world and re-read her words all over again. ‘Girl Defective’ is a book about the moment when everything changes, when you lose some and get some and the world falls into place (if, a little crookedly). Everyone has to read this, it’s good for the soul.

After 2 restful days at sea on Royal Caribbean’s Brilliance of the Seas, we are now ready to disembark on the beautiful Greek Island of Santorini. There are several different island groups off the coast of Greece. Some are more touristy than others. Santorini is in the Cyclades group. Many of these islands can be reached by ferries from Pireus – the port of Athens.
Living in the Pacific NW with all our beautiful green islands, it was a shock to see these Greek Islands as rocks in the blue Mediterranean Sea.
From a distance we thought there was salt on top of the rock. But as we got closer, we realized it was the charming village of Thira with it’s white-washed buildings. Just like pictures we had seen.
Everyone is on their own today. There are tours around the island or you just stay in Thira. Grab a chair atop the hill and have a drink watching the beautiful water.
Walk the narrow windy streets and poke in the many shops. Or visit some of the historical churches in the village. The weather is perfect and so is the view.
This island is very popular with all sizes of cruise ships. We counted over 10 the day we were there. All the way from very small to Windstar and the Queen Victoria.

The popularity of online gambling explained Online casinos came, saw and conquered the gambling industry. Online gambling has become a huge hit and it’s definitely here to stay. One might ask: what makes online gambling so popular? There are a number of reasons why online casino gambling is spreading like wildfire, and we have gathered the most important ones. Gambling excitement For many people gambling is like a forbidden seduction. But let’s be honest, there’s nothing more exciting than the possibility of winning or losing. Players share that excitement when they gamble at a brick-and-mortar casino. But more and more people prefer to play their favorite game at home, especially those who take their favorite pastime seriously. Easier to concentrate That brings us to the first advantage of online gambling: privacy. It’s much easier to focus when you play at an online casino as there are no distractions. In other words, online gambling boosts your concentration when playing table games or spinning the reels of an online slot machine. More convenient The convenience of playing at home is another big plus. You can enjoy a gambling session without the hassle of driving to a gambling parlor or buying overpriced drinks and snacks. Online gambling also gives a feeling of independence as you decide when, where and how long you play. Online assistance Most online casinos also provide first-timers with information about how to get started. Additionally, after signing up with an online gambling site you can contact their customer service. They offer several methods of communication, such as live chat, email, and telephone. Wealth of promotions Online players also benefit from all kind of promotions, including welcome bonuses and loyalty schemes. Welcome bonuses enable you to get acquainted with all aspects of online gambling. The free bonus money also allows you to improve your skills before playing for real money. Wide range of games Another big advantage of online gambling is the extensive gaming repertoire. Most online casinos offer a wealth of online slot games, in addition to an extensive portfolio of table games. An increasing number of online casinos also allow you to enjoy sports betting. Share

So I've been recruited by some buddies of mine to run a game of Savage Worlds for them in the near future, specifically Deadlands Reloaded.…
So, I was fucking around with some plugins and themes and stuff, trying to get my comics to look good on my blog (I failed, and decided that a separate WP install was the best way to make them readable) and along the way I messed something up, I guess because my site is borked.
At one point it was Totes Borked. The whole thing was completely inaccessible because in troubleshooting for one of the themes, I had found a thread instructing me to change the URL settings in my WP dashboard and that was a mistake. With a little help from some other googled threads, I got that fixed, and learned that editing my PHP databases manually is not so scary, but at some point something else got messed up.
If you try to go to http://manawaker.com your browser (or rather all of my browsers and the browsers of others I've asked to check for me) will try to download my index.php. It only happens if you try to go to the base domain. Going anywhere else works fine, even http://manawaker.com/site-home/ which is where you are supposed to end up after going to http://manawaker.com is working just peachy, but anyone who just types the address can't currently get to my site. This is bothersome.
I found several WP threads which claim that this is caused by an errant redirect line in the .htaccess file, but I've checked that file, and it contains no errant lines. In fact it matches the ideal configuration listed in the WP wiki.
I've hunted to my limit, and can find no solutions to this issue that don't tell me that my .htaccess needs to be fixed, so now I'm at a loss. Can someone(s) help me troubleshoot this further?
When I go there, it asks me to download a randomly named file with MIME type application/x-trash. After some cursory Google work, I came across a page that says you should be on the lookout for any old renamed index files. Do you have anything in the root folder named index.html.old or something to that effect?
There is such a file; index.html.old it is 7kb, and says it was last modified in 2014. Looking inside, it appears to be what the name implies: an old (pre-WP) version of the front page of the website. What should I do with it? Does it need to be deleted? Do references to it need to be removed from somewhere?
Rename it to orig-index.html.old, or move it to another folder. From what I've read, just appending that orig- is enough to do the trick.
What a weird error though. That file's been sitting there for years, and just decided to cause a problem yesterday. I wonder what I did to set it off... (not that it matters. I'm just glad it works now. )
A change you made may have re-written or appended the httaccess file. Instead of pointing to index.php as the "index" page, it may have pointed to index.html but maybe with a wildcard instead of index.html specifically.
Please. We don't even have FTP installed on the Icrontic server. I'm just making assumptions about budget WordPress hosting.
Even budget WordPress hosting should offer a reasonably secure method of accessing the site. If it's so budget that they only offer standard, completely insecure FTP... find a different budget provider. o_O
I use 1and1 hosting, and I log into my files with Filezilla. Everytime I login I get "Insecure server, it does not support FTP over TLS", but it still lets me do what I went there to do, so I've ignored it.
Yeah.... if you're using insecure FTP, you've got a decent chance of someone grabbing your username and password and trashing your site. Especially if you ever use public WiFi. Back up often.
And get onto a better host or make them enable SFTP or FTPS or something. Filezilla will support it.
B) The index.html file should have been a blank file that you don't touch. It's a file that has to do with very low-level site security for php sites. It's importaint even though it doesn't provide much security. note: Either your .htaccess or your host messed up the redirect that forces the index.php file over the index.html... or you got hacked...
C) Back up, Back up, Back up... never have a site that you're not doing regular offsite backups of. If you don't have anything Consider Akeeba Backup for WordPress https://www.akeebabackup.com/products/akeeba-backup-wordpress.html
I have begun using a back-up plug-in. Previously, I was just making a copy of the /wp dir onto my PC every once in a while, but I've since been informed that that is not good enough, so I installed UpdraftPlus on all three of my sites.

I have trekked in the Khumbu many times. Once as a trekker and the rest for climbs of Everest or other mountains. I am often asked questions about trekking to Everest Base Camp (EBC) so here are the most frequent questions with my answers. This information is based on my experience and are my opinions so always consult with a professional before making any serious decisions.
A: The trek to Everest Base Camp (EBC) is by far the most popular. There are many variations to get there in addition to going straight up the valley. For example, you can go by way of Goyko for a great diversion. A side trip to Chhukhung Valley is also well worth it. Trekking in eastern Nepal in the Annunapurna area is also extremely popular. Another emerging popular trek is the Manaslu Circuit.
A: Almost every climbing guide company offers a trekking option to their climbing expeditions. But there are also trekking only companies that do a great job. Many companies based in Kathmandu offer treks, however be wary of the lowest cost ones. In 2014, The Nepal Government started to require all trekkers to have a guide, but it is unclear if this is enforced. A permit is required to enter the Sagarmatha National Pak where Everest is located.
A: It depends on your route but most EBC treks take about 20 days. You do not want to go on a rush trek primarily due to the altitude. You land in Lukla at 9250' and go to EBC at 17,500. If you go too fast you will get altitude sickness which can be deadly.
A: If you can walk 5 miles a day and are in good aerobic shape (with a doctor's approval) you should do fine. The actually trekking is on mostly level ground with a few sections of steep hillsides - up and down. You should not be carrying more than a light day pack with a jacket, water and snacks. However, it is the altitude the creates the main issues. That said, the better shape you are in, the more you will enjoy the overall experience.
A: Yes and no. Yes; because altitude can kill people so care must be take to acclimatize properly. No; from the lack of so-called "objective" danger such as rock fall or crevasses normally associated with climbing. However, people have been seriously injured by yaks who inadvertently bump them off the trail and down a steep hillside. So always be on the uphill side when a yak passes by! There have been kidnappings, attacks and murders in this area, so be street smart.
A: The spring season starts cold and gets warmer whereas fall is the opposite. Both can see significant snow at any time but more so in the fall. In general the skies are more clear into the early fall thus providing better views of Everest and other mountains. It is common to experience rain, sometimes very heavy, lower down valley between Lukla and Namache in both seasons.
You’re about to spend $1,000 or even $5,000 to trek to Everest Base Camp – but are you ready? Summit Coach's consulting service can help trekkers of all experience levels better prepare and increase their chances of a positive expedition. Based on Alan Arnette’s 23 years of high altitude mountain experience and 30 years as a business executive, we help aspiring trekkers throughout the world achieve their goals through a personalized set of consulting services. A special $300 consultation package is offered to EBC trekkers only from this page. Please contact Summit Coach for details.

A: In 2014, The Nepal Government started to require all trekkers to have a guide, but it is unclear if this is enforced. A permit is required to enter the Sagarmatha National Pak where Everest is located. It depends on your skills and experience but I would almost always recommend some kind of help for the logistics. Long treks are a maze of details. Also, a great guide will make your overall experience more memorable.
A: Most guided treks have eight to fifteen trekkers with an equal number of support staff. Depending on the company, they may or may not have a western guide. Keep in mind that larger groups means slower pace and more complicated meals and logistics.
A: References is the best method. It is easy to set up a website and call yourself a guide and there is no oversight in this industry. If something goes wrong, you have little resources with an unknown company.
A: You can spend as little or as much as you want. There are three options for a trek: 1) organize your own 2) a Nepalese company or 3) a western guided commercial trek. The one on your on is obvious: you do everything; all you need is to get to Lukla and spend money on the park permit ($13.84 or 1000 rupees) and food. In theory, you could spend less than $500 for the entire trek not including air fare. There are companies in Katmandu that can help arrange just a porter to carry your bags and perhaps with the teahouses. But you are on your own including navigation.
Then there are more formal treks arranged by Kathmandu companies. They offer a Nepalese leader who speaks English and understands not to push too fast for acclimatization reasons. They do a great job and charge between $1,000 to $3,000 or more. In general the better ones charge more. Many western companies offer treks with a western guide, British, Australian, American, etc. They cater to western styles meaning they explain what you are seeing, ensure food is cooked properly and hygiene is maintained. Their prices are US$4,000 and up.
Finally there is the trek with Everest climbers where you join an actual climbing team as they make their way to Everest Base Camp for their climb. This is usually with one of the major expedition companies such as Adventure Consultants, International Mountain Guides or Jagged Globe for example. You usually spend one or two nights at base camp with the climbers. This is usually the most expensive option costing around US$4,000 but is also the safest, cleanest and can be most entertaining.
A: It often comes down to who leads the trek - local or western. With a western leader you are paying for that person's travel and time and it is spread amongst all the trekkers. In return you get western style leadership with good language skills and perhaps some simple medical training. Some low cost treks will stay in tents, not teahouses or in old teahouses with questionable kitchen practices.
A: I have a complete page devoted to this question for climbing but trekking is somewhat similar if you want to fully enjoy the experience. You will want to be in good shape and not carry any extra body weight. In general, focus on aerobic capacity and core strength. I suggest a steady exercise routine including extensive aerobic work. You should be doing daily walks with at least one 5 mile walk each week with a 15lb pack six months before your trek. Do as much uphill as possible. If you live in a flat area, go to a stadium and use the steps with your pack.
A: Not really. The common approach is to move slowly up the mountain (1000' a day maximum) spending your days at a higher altitude than where you sleep up until your summit bid. The human body simply does not function well at high altitudes and can experience acute mountain sickness (AMS) above 8,000 feet. There is half the available oxygen at 18,000' as compared to sea level so letting your body adjust is the key to staying healthy.
The lower oxygen stimulates chemoreceptors that initiate an increase in breathing, resulting in a lowering of the partial pressure of CO2 and hence more alkaline blood pH. The kidneys begin to unload bicarbonate to compensate. Though this adaptation can take many days, up to 80% occurs just in the first 48 to 72 hours. There are many other physiologic changes going on, among them the stimulus of low oxygen to release the hormone, erythropoietin to stimulate more red blood cell production, a physiological and still acceptable form of blood doping that enhances endurance performance at low altitudes. Adaptive changes are not always good for one’s health. Some South American high altitude residents can have what’s called chronic mountain sickness, resulting from too many red blood cells; their blood can be up to 84-85% red blood cells. The increased blood viscosity and sometimes associated pulmonary hypertension can result in right heart failure.
You cannot do much to acclimatize at low altitudes but there are companies that claim to help the acclimatization process through specially designed tents that simulate the reduced oxygen levels at higher elevations. I have no personal experience with these systems but you can find more details at the Hypoxico website. They cost about $7,000 or can be rented for about $170 a week. I would not recommend this for a trek. Outside Magazine posted an article in 2013 questioning their effectiveness.
A: My strategy is based on lot's of layers. Since it can get very cold, It is always critical to protect toes, fingers and face since these were most susceptible to frost bite. As for warmth, I always wear a knit cap and at least liner gloves when I get the least bit cool - regardless of the outside temp. I use a 3 layer system of Merino wool base layer (top and bottom), a warmth layer then a wind or rain layer. I have a gear page for reference and suggest looking at the Colorado 14er column for trekking suggestions.
1liter of water with Gatorade in a Camelback since it is not freezing but also bring a Nalgene bottle
iPod. Along the trail and for snoring roommates. I like the shuffle without a hard disc so it will work at altitude and the battery last longer.
A clean, dry shirt and socks to change into once arriving at the teahouse while waiting for your duffle to arrive
I also always have my computer laptop, sat phone, solar recharger, cables in my pack since I don't want to have them damaged. But if you pack these carefully inside a sleeping bag sack or down clothing they might be OK carried by Porters or Zos. However I see bags dropped all the time very harshly so I prefer to carry the extra few pounds. My day pack might be about 10 lbs with computer but without the sleeping bag.
If you bring a water bladder, like a CamelBak or MSR Dromedary (which I recommend-more rugged) also bring a Nalgene. It is easier to fill at teahouses or from streams when sterilized via the SteriPen. Also it can be filed with hot water and put in your sleeping bag for those extremely cold nights near EBC.
A: Sleeping bag (0F is fine), toiletries plus wet wipes (yes) and a change of clothes, primarily socks and underwear plus one heavy (down) jacket plus some comfortable shoes in the teahouses. I also suggest your own cotton pillow case stuffed with your down jacket as a pillow.
A: You can rinse out clothes in tubs supplied by teahouses but that is not usually done. In general trekkers get used to the smell and dust. Hot showers are available in teahouses for a small charge but it uses precious resources that must be carried up by yak or human.
A: There are internet cafes in Lukla, Namache and a few villages up to Gorak Shep (last before EBC). They charge a reasonable price for being where it is but not 100% reliable. Satellite phones are the most common method. I use Thuraya which transmits both voice and data (including email) from anywhere within their coverage area. Some tea house offer satellite or wired phone service but these cannot be depended on. Expedition companies charge anywhere from $3 to $7 USD per minute so charges can rack up quickly.
A Thuraya phone cost about $800 US and $1 a minute or less. If you will use more than 800 minutes and go on multiple treks, buying a phone makes a lot of sense. The Thuraya satellites only covers Europe and Asia and not the US or South America. Iridium is the other option but it does not perform as reliably in my experience. See the technology section on my gear page for details. For details on my expedition communications, please see this tutorial.
A: Yes. Just point the device mostly east. It is an easy and inexpensive way to letting those back home know where you are and you are ok. Remember it only tracks 7 days of data however on the Google Map. For details on my expedition communications, please see this tutorial.
A: Yes. GSM (not CDMA e.g. Version) cell phone service is available with a Nepal Cell phone company SIM card. Check with your outfitter. It can be arranged in KTM. However, for guaranteed access rent a Thuraya sat phone here in the US or in KTM. For details on my expedition communications, please see this tutorial.
A: The teahouses have charging ability via their solar panels but if it has been cloudy for several days, there may not be enough reserves to charge a computer or camera thus always have an extra battery. Teahouses usually charge for it - maybe a 100 rupees an hour so bring some extra cash. Many people want to use their chargers so try to plug your stuff in as soon as you arrive. A solio power charger is a good idea for battery recharger. For details on my expedition communications, please see this tutorial.
A: It seems like everything costs 100 to 200 rupees - candy bar, bottle water, extra fried rice at dinner. You will pay for hot showers or to use the battery for charging. You will spend more than you think so bring lots of rupees in smaller dominations. 100s are great, stay away from 500 and 1000 notes. US dollars are sometimes taken but rupees are preferred.
A: It is about 38 miles from Lukla to EBC and it should take a minimum of nine days. You generally walk about 4 to 6 hours each day starting about 8:00AM.
A: Actually pretty good if you are not with a low cost guide service - they pick the old teahouses. The better services book trekkers in solid teahouses that are quite clean. but I still recommend using your own sleeping bag and not their sheets/pillows
A: Not in the teahouse since they double boil most of the time. On the trail, iodine is best but a SteriPen would work best - bring extra batteries, etc. All that said, expect to get some intestinal issue at some point - everyone does.
You never want to drink untreated water or muddy water from streams or still water even if you see the locals doing it. Always drink treated water. You can buy bottled water from the teahouses but it creates a huge waste problem. It is best to treat water from the teahouse tap with iodine or a SteriPen to eliminate the waste of the bottle.
A: Yes. The vast majority of the time you are on a well worn trail with other people ahead or behind you. But this is a sparse country and the villages are miles apart. it is easy to follow a yak trail instead of the main trail. There are multiple valleys along the way and going up the wrong valley can be a huge mistake. Carry a map and don't get away from your group.
A: There is Kala Patar at 18,192' just above Gorak Shep. It is a wonderful easy climb that offers amazing views of Everest, base camp and all the surrounding mountains. It is a must do activity. Just make sure you have been acclimatizing properly and take it slow and easy. Schedule a day if possible. Go early in the morning to avoid the afternoon clouds that block Everest.
If you want to climb something more technical, then the trekking peaks of Island Peak (20,305'), Lobuche and Mera are also available but these generally require a fair amount of climbing experience with crampon and ropes. They also require climbing permits and are not consider part of a normal trek only itinerary.
A: For 2013, check for the latest regulations. In 2012 the rules changed banning all trekkers, including those with climbing teams, from staying at Base Camp. However, it was rescinded at the last minute. In the past, if you are with a climbing expedition, you can spend the night at EBC. To enter the Icefall legally requires a mountaineering permit.
A: It is a small community up there. However, climbers will sometimes shy away from interacting with strangers after they have been in BC for a few weeks. They have probably already gone through all the contagious stuff and do not want to be exposed to new strains. It is not personal but they have paid tens of thousands to climb Everest and don't want to get sick.
A: Try to be in Namache on a Saturday morning for the weekly market. Go to morning prayers at the Monastery in Tengboche. Spin every prayer wheel you pass. Climb Kala Patar. Stop and talk to the children, take their pictures and show it back to them. Ask adults if you can take their picture. If you have time visit Goyko and Chhukhung. Take 10 times more pictures than you think you should. Walk slow and enjoy each moment! You can read about my trek for my experience.
A: Yes. Everest Base Camp - a trek with Ang Dorge Sherpa is a recent well written description of the trek fro Randy Birch who made the trek in 2012. You can buy it on Amazon
A: Yes, writing pens e.g. BICs and tooth brushes and tooth paste. Please consider supporting Smile High.
A: On the border between Nepal and Tibet (China). It is in the Himalaya mountain range which stretches 1500 miles from Northeastern Pakistan to Bhutan. There are over thirty mountains higher than 25,000 feet. Of the fourteen 8,000 meter peaks, nine are located in the Himalayas making it clearly the top of the world.
A: In 1841 a British surveyor named Sir George Everest identified the location of the mountain. Fifteen years later using trigonometry and measurements from 12 different survey stations around the mountain 'Peak XV' was surveyed as the world's highest mountain at 29,002 feet. In 1865 it was re-named Mt. Everest and is called Sagarmatha by the Nepalese and Chomolungma in Tibet. In 1955, the height was adjusted to 29,028'. On May 5,1999 a National Geographic Society Expedition put a GPS receiver on the summit. Using a second Trimble GPS receiver at the 26,000' South Col they could make an extremely accurate measurement by running the two receivers simultaneously. The new altitude was 29,035 feet or 8,850 meters. However, the Nepalese still use 29,028' as the official altitude.
A: In 1924, George Mallory and Sandy Irvine made the first serious attempt. It is still unknown if they made the summit, but both died on the mountain. In 1953, Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary make the first successful summit. In 1975, Japanese Junko Tabei became the first woman to summit the hill. Austrian Peter Habeler and Italian Reinhold Messner were the first trekkers to summit Everest without bottled oxygen. 1996 was probably the most controversial year with fifteen trekkers dying on the mountain thus spawning worldwide debate and interest in alpine mountaineering.
A: The Himalayan Database reports that there have been 8,306 summits (4,333 members and 3,973 hired) of Everest through June 2017 on all routes by 4,833 different people. 1,106 people, mostly Sherpa, have summited multiple times. There have been 539 summits by women. The Nepal side is more popular with 5,280 summits compared to 3,026 summits from the Tibet side. 208 climbers summited without supplemental oxygen, about 2.5%. 32 climbers have traversed from one side to the other. About 63% of all expeditions put at least one member on the summit.
288 people (173 westerners and 115 Sherpas) have died on Everest from 1924 to June 2017, about 3.5%. 71 died on the descent after their summit or 25%. 11 women have died.The Nepal side has 181 deaths or 3.4%, a rate of 1.27. The Tibet side has 107 deaths or 3.3%, a rate of 1.15. Most bodies are still on the mountain but China has removed many bodies from sight. The top causes of death were from avalanche (77), fall (67), altitude sickness (32) and exposure (26).
In 2017 there were 648 summits, 237 from Tibet and 411 from Nepal and 11 didn't use supplemental oxygen. There were 6 deaths.
From 1923 to 1999: 170 people died on Everest with 1,169 summits or 14.5%. But the deaths drastically declined from 2000 to 2017 with 7,056 summits and 118 deaths or 1.7%. However, two years skewed the deaths rates with 17 in 2014 and 14 in 2015. The reduction in deaths is primarily due to better gear, weather forecasting and more people climbing with commercial operations.
Of the 8000 meter peaks, Everest has the highest absolute number of deaths at 288 but ranks near the bottom with a death rate of 1.23. Annapurna is the most deadly 8000er with one death for about every three summits (71:261) or a 3.91 death rate. Cho Oyu is the safest with 3,681 summits and 50 deaths or a death rate of 0.55.

The saddest thing about Trump is that this is absolutely true about him. He was raised to completely overlook the good in anyone. Probably, even himself. His utter lack of shit-giving for anyone else on the planet informs every choice he makes. Goodness, love, compassion, informs nothing. He is one sad jackass.

Talibah Lateefah Newman was planted, watered, and home grown in Dallas, Texas. She is a writer–director and a 2013 graduate of Columbia University’s MFA program for film directing. Talibah is the eldest of five and discovered her passion of filmmaking through writing short stories and shooting short films with her family at the tender age of 11. Talibah graduated from the Hockaday School of Dallas, Texas and went on to attend Columbia University’s undergraduate program majoring in film studies, African American studies, and creative writing. Post undergrad, she braved New York City landing several internships and production jobs in her field with companies such as Ted Hope’s This is That Production Company, Jonathan Demme’s Clinica Estetico, Malcolm Lee’s Blackmaled Productions and Optomen Productions. While devoting long hours to her internships she worked tirelessly on a short film about her late Grandfather and acclaimed jazz musician, David Fathead Newman, titled American Treasure.
As an M.F.A. student Talibah sought to tell stories of familial relationships, precocious children, single character journeys into recreating identity, the complicated mosaic of religion and faith, and redefining race. Her films tackle the inner workings of family units as she seeks to discover the essence of what makes familial love last and replicate her own personal experiences with her family.
Her films Our Father, Alterations , Busted on Brigham Lane and Sweet Honey Chile’ are a testament to her mission and fervor as a budding director and writer. In addition to her narrative directorial work, Talibah is also helming a documentary titled Hair Once Sacred, which chronicles her mother’s life work and activism as a natural hair care stylist in Dallas, Texas who was arrested for practicing the ancestral art of hair braiding. When not directing, Talibah continues to chisel several feature film projects including a script titled Special, Based on The Dropout By Joseph Mathews, which is the coming of age story of a young African American boy who was unjustly placed in special education from the time he was in third grade until he decided to take control of his life and drop out. In addition, Ms. Newman has released season one of a comedic webseries titled Famous Farrah on Youtube and is currently chiseling her directorial debut feature script and working on an original television pilot.
Talibah is the 2012 Director’s Guild of America winner in the African American Category for her film Busted on Brigham Lane, which was acquired by HBO for exhibition in 2012. Talibah’s Films have screened at the Bahamas International Film Festival, Urban World Film Festival, The Chicago Black Harvest Film Festival, The Palm Springs LGBT Film Festival, The American Black Film Festival, Martha’s Vineyard Film Festival, Los Angeles Film Festival, The Undergound Film Festival in Minneapolis, The Pan African Film Festival, Rooftop Film Festival, and many more. In addition, she is a Princess Grace Honorarium awardee as well as an Adrienne Shelly Foundation Awardee for her thesis film Sweet Honey Chile’, which was awarded best short film of 2013 at the Martha’s Vineyard Film Festival and will be exhibited on HBO starting February of 2014.

clean this up as well as a couple other spots and reassemble for pipes, side stand, battery box/tray then it’s final tear down for finishes.
A reminder about where we stand on training, playing and socials as we head into the final month of the 15s season.
We have Coram’s Fields booked until the last 1st XV game of the season. The final training here will be on Wednesday 20th April.
Regent’s Park only mark rugby pitches until Easter Weekend each season, regardless of how early/late it might fall. We have all now played our last home game in the park. Home games from this point will be played elsewhere.
This is the final day of league games for the 2s & 4s. The 3s have their cup semi this day while the 1s are also on the road in the league. We expect to field the Bulls, possibly for the final time this season. Business as usual.
The 3s have their MMT League Play Off Semi, the 2s will be in their cup Quarter Finals and the 4s in their plate QFs.
in previous years this would be the final weekend of 15s and we would have just a couple of sides out. This year we are expecting to fulfil the below games, all competitive and relevant to the success of the season:
Finals Day. If results go the right way, the 1s & 3s will be playing to win their leagues and the 2s & 4s will be in knockout finals:
We will not arrange additional games, but we will set up socials around watching & supporting the teams playing for trophies & titles.
The end of season wrap party will be taking place at the White Mustache followed by our infamous Silly Sunday!
Obviously the major rugby on this weekend will be taking place in Greece but we will also be entering a side into the Middlesex 7s at Richmond FC.
We will also look at other 7s competitions as well as entering a side into Regent’s Park Touch Competitions once more.
Belsize Park captain Tom House admits his squad have been eyeing Saturday’s crucial top-of-the-table clash for a while, and he is confident of coming out on top.
Belsize secured their second promotion in three years last term, and they are now looking to move up from London North-West Division Three in the coming weeks.
House’s side sit second with three games to go, just four points behind Fullerians, and this weekend they host the leaders in a showdown which could decide who moves up the pyramid.
Belsize, who are unbeaten on their own turf in Regent’s Park since September 2013, have won seven games in a row and another victory could take them into top spot – which is the only place guaranteed to provide promotion.
Second place may well be enough, as it was last season, but a defeat on Saturday could open the door for third-placed Welwyn to overtake them and leave BP outside the top two.
“It’s absolutely massive, there’s no doubt about that in our minds,” House told Ham&High Sport. “We’re on a good run though, we’ve won every game since the new year and we can’t wait to get out there to be honest.
“I think our eyes have probably been on this for a little bit too long, hence the slightly closer results than we might have anticipated –like the one against Wasps in our last game.
“We kind of knew that we had to win everything up to this point to ensure that it mattered, but then as the momentum started to build and we beat Welwyn and then Datchworth a few weeks ago, we’ve really started to think about this big one.
“There’s everything to play for. We need to win with a bonus point and deny them a bonus point to go top, so it’s very exciting.”
A narrow victory would take Belsize level on points with Fullerians, but still leave them second. They need to score four tries to get the bonus fifth point, while also beating their rivals by at least eight points to deny their visitors a losing bonus point and overhaul them.
“Absolutely, and the boys won’t need any encouragement to get up for the game,” said the skipper. “If anything my job will be to keep them composed, keep them calm and keep them focused on doing what they’ve done so well all season.
“It will be about us playing our best game and sticking to our game plan and keeping it nice and straightforward.
“We’ve got some real fliers in our back line who can score from anywhere on the pitch, and they’ve been brilliant all season, so we’re not worried about not being able to score tries or anything like that. It’s not really been an issue.
“We haven’t really thought about the prospect of losing either, or what the implications of that would be. We try to only have positive thoughts.
“The games that we’ve lost, looking back, were times when we were maybe fielding slightly weaker sides, because of injuries or people travelling or having to work.
“But we’ve got a full-strength squad to pick from on Saturday – apart from my brother Freddie, who has unfortunately been injured for most of the year – so we can’t wait for it.”
December, but that was a narrow 24-21 victory on their home turf, and House is confident Belsize Park can gain revenge on their own ground this weekend.
“We felt we should have beaten them last time,” he said. “We missed three kickable penalties, we put a lot of pressure on them and we were hammering at their 22 but we couldn’t quite get into it.
“They kept conceding penalties at the breakdown but the referee wouldn’t send anyone off because it wasn’t in the 22, which seemed a bit arbitrary at the time.
“They’ve got a big set of forwards, they’re very organised, and they’re skilful at the breakdown. But we’ll have Sam Bennett back, who’s our master at the breakdown, and Alex Lee, who wins turnover after turnover.
“I don’t think either of those played the last time we played them so we’ll fancy our chances – and our home record speaks for itself.”
Last weekend saw the second and final club day of the preseason with four teams taking to the field in Dulwich against Old Alleynians. Belsize fielded 79 players in an afternoon that saw another clean sweep for the central Londoners. The 1st XV ran out 38 – 14 victors, the 2nds 104 – 5, the thirds 41 – 17 and the fourths completed the rout 31- 22.
The Belsize attacking flair was evident across the board as free flowing rugby lead to the tries rained in from all areas.
We have a fantastic club day lined up for this Saturday, acting as the culmination of the past two months of hard pre-season training.
We have three matches scheduled and despite many players still being away on holidays, we have almost 80 players to pick from. Thus, the aim is to give everyone a run, easing you back into full-contact rugby, and for coaches to have a look at all players.
The games have been timed to allow for certain players to cover key positions in two matches. Please make sure you double check to see if your name is down in more than one squad.
Please do remember that if you make yourself available you should do everything in your power to play. The details for all games are listed below.
How to Get There: East London RFC is 5 mins walk from West Ham station, which is located on the Circle, Jubilee, District & DLR lines as well as the train out of Fenchurch St
After the match we expect to be entertained well by our hosts, who have hired a karaoke machine for the evening, so we’ll be showing the oppo how we win the party. We shall also welcome all our new joiners (if all goes to plan, we have 21 new caps this Saturday) so clear your diaries for the evening, make every effort to stay for East London’s hospitality and also enjoy some beers with any new team mates.
Human resources for Oil and Gas - Calgary Oilfield Services | Business Services | Oilfield Consulting
The days of pens and paper files when keeping track of human resources or trying to create human resource solutions are long gone. It may be regretted in some ways but the fact is we all live in a digital world where software PC programmes dominate and the sooner you get used to it the better. The human resources solutions business has forced us to accept this and any alternative carries serious risks for your business. Online hr consultant toronto solutions are rapidly taking over where paper files and folders once ruled. Increasingly more HR departments are moving towards solutions and systems that make their businesses more manageable and effective.
When considering the issues and the adoption of either: a paper-based system; a computer-based downloadable system; or a human resource solution that is based online there are a range of things to think about. Moreover, how do you know in a nutshell why and whether you should adopt a human resource solution that is online or web-based. Well, here are 5 reasons why human resource software solutions based online are better than any other paper or downloadable system.
Organization is critical when, for example, you need to do business-performance appraisals of your employees. Depending on the number of staff you have you will need a system to compare all the components your company includes as important when measuring business performance. A web application or web-based human resource software solution will be ideal for maximum organization.
Imagine you have a paper system for your human resource solution and your offices burn down! You’ll be insured for your property but you’ll never recover all those files. Now imagine you have a computer with a human resources programme and it is backed up on another computer. However, say you get a virus and the who thing gets infected. An online human resource solution is probably better protected than anything else and will be backed up several times over so likely to be far more secure.
Online human resource solutions are also likely to be much easier for multiple people to access. Say you had a paper file solution or downloaded programme and then your HR manager was not able to get into the office. Not only can they not get into the system from home…no one else can get in either! An online human resource solution would resolve this.
Using online human resources solutions to help manage your employees’ performance allows you to be more efficient with your time and energy. No messing with paper or piles of sticky notes. An online application can reduce the amount of effort and cost exerted and the time a business takes to perform their staff evaluations accurately.
Keeping your HR management performance simple should be a goal for any human resource solution. Some might think that software is too difficult but it is much more likely to increase the speed of performance appraisals while offering a better grasp on progress of your employees with ease to view them from any location at any time. Staff nolonger have question evaluations that do not go their preferred way. http://www.salopekconsulting.com/
While we're all sitting back, waiting for the UN to impose sanctions on Iran, that august body has elected Iran onto its Commission for the Status of Women, which is supposedly ""dedicated exclusively to gender equality and advancement of women".
Iran has warned suntanned women and girls who looked like "walking mannequins" will be arrested as part of a new drive to enforce the Islamic dress code...
The announcement came shortly after Ayatollah Kazim Sadighi, a leading cleric, warned that women who dressed immodestly disturbed young men and the consequent agitation caused earthquakes.
At least they didn't elect Cuba, Saudi Arabia and China to the Human Right Council. No, hold on, they've already done that.

Labadee is a part of Haiti that is owned by Royal Caribbean. The area around Labadee is very green and lush. You can take a look at my walk around video above: I go from the cruise ship to the main beach on the left side, and then loop back to the cruise ship via the the second beach on the right side. (If you go there, you’ll understand what I mean by the left and right.) The beach area itself is quite nice; it’s definitely been engineered to accommodate a lot of cruise passengers. The beach on the right seemed to have better water if you want to go for a dip. You can read the detailed account here.
Labadee in Haiti has the longest over-water zip line in the world: Dragon’s Breath Flight Line. It’s quite high, and you end up going quite fast. The zoom on my camera may obscure just exactly how high and long the zip line is, so here are the numbers: it is 2,600 feet long and 500 feet high. You end up reaching speeds of 40 to 50 miles per hour! You can read the detailed account here.
For those of you who haven’t heard yet, Rebecca and I have moved to Papua New Guinea (PNG). I am working at Pacific Adventist University (PAU) as Dean of the School of Business and Rebecca is studying full time towards a Bachelor of Arts degree.
Last year the opportunity presented itself for me to travel to Papua New Guinea. I visited our long time friends David and Carol Tasker, both of whom were Deans at PAU. They had tried for many years to get me to come and “have a look”, and in mid 2007 I took the time. The outcome of the “look” was that I ended up seeing the need in the School of Business. As a result, Rebecca and I decided to take up the challenge of providing the people of the pacific with an opportunity to receive an education that will allow them to compete on a global basis. I therefore resigned from Microsoft in October and took a well deserved holiday.
While we were waiting for Visas, Rebecca and I travelled through Malaysia, Thailand and Myanmar on a motorbike (see posts on this site). We then headed to Brisbane and spent Christmas with our families and drove down to Sydney for training on how to live in another culture. We finally arrived in PNG early February.
We live in a wonderful place. As you can see in the photo below, we live on a hill, with a great view far into the distance.
From the house we look over the most lush valley. The photo below is early in the morning. I am still in awe every morning while having my breakfast, because it is so beautiful and soothing. The environment on the university campus is truly calming.
We get the most amazing weather. During the rainy season, there is usually rain in the hills every afternoon, but the sun comes through just before sunset. As a result, we see a lot of rainbows.
The following photos are taken from the Sunday morning markets. Hundreds of cars come from Port Moresby (a 20km drive) to buy their fruit and vegetables. The university operates a farm and the produce demands a premium over other suppliers.
This photo was taken through the fly screen, as I was too lazy to walk outside to take yet another sunset photo. I have so many of them now, because the sunsets are different every night. This photo was special, because the sun was setting directly between the two hills in the distance.
As you can see, we really live in paradise. Up until recently, we had a lot of rain, though usually just showers late afternoon or during the night. But the rain stopped really suddenly two weeks ago, and now the dry season has started. It is still up to 31 degrees Celsius during the day, but has been as low as 17 during the night.
My, I didn’t realize the college was in such a lovely setting. It looks very peaceful. Thanks so much for sharing those photos and what’s happening in your lives.
Looks like an interesting place. Glad to hear that you guys are safe and well and have settled in nicely. Hope you get your internet access issues sorted before long so we can hear more from you!
Thanks for these pictures – they depict the beautiful environment where the university is located – brings one’s thoughts closer to the creator.

The wrongful taking or using another person's identifying information for the purpose of fraud or other criminal activity.
Identity theft usually has economic gain as a motive but it has also been used a a weapon of, or to conceal acts of terrorism.
A person's identity - individual or corporation - includes his or her name, represents the most sacred personal asset.
Flowing from a name is other critical personal identity data such as date of birth, social insurance or security numbers, health card number, driver's license and bank, PIN and, the most valuable of all: credit card numbers.
Once the theft is complete, the personal identity information is used to set up consumer scams on others or to impersonate the victim and effect financial transactions to the thief or his associates, in the name and at the expense of the victim.
Perpetrators of identity theft often use the information to obtain even more personal personification documents such as birth certificates, passport or immigration documents leading to education expenses or even the redirection of retirement or pension funds.
The harvesting of identity information by identity occurs covertly, typically without the knowledge or even within the presence of the victim. Thieves feed on the ubiquitous nature of personal identity data.
The crime can be committed as simply as peering over a victim's shoulder when they input their PIN while making an withdrawal at an automatic teller machine; or digging through garbage for bank or credit card statements. Often a victim of break and enter or wallet/purse theft will find that their most valued personal documents are gone as the thieves know they can get good coin for the resale of these stolen assets.
"The criminal, a convicted felon, not only incurred more than $100,000 of credit card debt, obtained a federal home loan, and bought homes, motorcycles, and handguns in the victim's name, but called his victim to taunt him -- saying that he could continue to pose as the victim for as long as he wanted because identity theft was not a federal crime at that time -- before filing for bankruptcy, also in the victim's name. While the victim and his wife spent more than four years and more than $15,000 of their own money to restore their credit and reputation, the criminal served a brief sentence for making a false statement to procure a firearm, but made no restitution to his victim for any of the harm he had caused."

Are you looking for a dumpster to rent? Here are simple tips to follow to get the best experience possible for you.
A great way to manage waste that builds up during your project, such as home renovation or remodeling, in Vicksburg is to rent a dumpster. Here at Top Dog, we believe that the process is smoothest when you are familiar with the main steps in the rental process. That is why we outline below ways to get the exact dumpster you need, so that there are no surprises for you and you get the right service for your unique project.
- The first step is to get a price quote from the rental company. Collect all relevant documentation you will need to get a precise quote. If you want more information on this process or have related questions, call us at 601-707-8233.
- Next, brainstorm what questions to ask the rental company to make sure you won’t end up paying for services that aren’t essential for your project, as well as how to avoid paying unnecessary fees.
- Thirdly, determine where you want the dumpster to go on the site. You will need to explain the site location on the phone. Take the time to prepare the chosen spot for the roll-off container, removing any of your own materials so that they won’t get damaged.
To receive an accurate quote of the price for your particular project, you will need to have certain information on hand. Write down the following details onto a sheet of paper and have them with you when you call Top Dog Dumpster Rental at 601-707-8233. Not only will you get the right price quote but you will also make the booking process a smooth and efficient one, saving you time in your busy day.
Any rental company will want to know what kind of waste you plan to put into your container. We also want to know the amount of that waste that you estimate will go into the bin. As you likely can’t say exact figures, we ask for your best estimate. Once we have that information, we can select the best size of dumpster for your project to recommend to you. There are generally four container sizes available, which are 10, 20, 30 and 40 yards.
If you have trouble predicting how much waste will go into the dumpster, we understand that it is not an easy task. If you offer us a guess and explain it is just that, a number that may not be accurate, we suggest you book one size higher for the rental. That way you will be prepared, should additional waste be added to the bin. This method will save you from needing to rent a second dumpster later, which would be more expensive than renting one of a bigger size.
Informing us about the type of waste material you’re planning to dispose will help us make sure you’re aware of the kind of materials which we do not allow to be placed in the dumpster.
Telling us what material you plan to use in the roll-off container allows us to explain what types of waste we do not allow to be put into our dumpsters. Once the dumpster size is chosen, the next step is to explain to our friendly team where and when you want the delivery. That provides us with the ability to book the dumpster for you for the days and times you need it, as well as knowing exactly where to deliver it. Please call us at 601-707-8233 at least one week before you need it to get a precise price quote and so we can schedule you in.
There are several details involved in a price quote for a dumpster in Vicksburg, MS. We are happy to provide you a price quote free of charge at 601-707-8233. While some rental companies charge by the container size, others include the weight size along with the canister size. Ask us which type we will use for your quote so that you are clear.
The quote also includes a fee for landfill charges, which covers the cost incurred by us when we go to the landfill with your roll-off canister.
If you keep the dumpster for longer than the scheduled days, some rental companies will charge you a penalty. Avoid that additional cost by keeping the dumpster for at least one day longer than you think you will require it.

Athens has been for centuries the capital of the world and the place where some of the most valuable ideas surfaced and took shape. There are Greece paintings dedicated to the ancient philosophers and historians, as well as the buildings where history was written. The Acropolis and Parthenon are instantly recognizable sites, even by those who never visited the island and are not exactly well-versed in history. The fact that they coexist with modern structures is even more impressive and the Greek posters available at FastFramePrints.com are impressive for this particular reason. Extremes frequently attract and even though the contrast is obvious, the entire image looks consistent and it will catch the eye of any guests. The countryside is just as beautiful and with hundreds of tiny islands scattered all over the place, there are plenty of Greek prints celebrating them. Santorini and the Mykonos island are unique and the white silhouettes of the towns, in contrast with the blue sea create a powerful image.

We had our first encounter with alpacas in 2007 and the seed was planted! By spring of 2008, we had purchased our first alpacas, five bred females and two males. Our herd has grown considerably since then along with our knowledge and appreciation of all the benefits of these unique animals.
The entire family is very involved with the alpaca operation. Our four children, Dustin, Kaila, Ashley and Wyatt are the capable farm hands, whether it is helping with the shearing, sorting fiber, halter breaking or cleaning barns. Of course, the favorite time of year is when the babies are born!
Our breeding program is focused on color and we are proud to have some very unique and impressive bloodlines on our farm. Along with breeding high quality animals, we also have a farm store where we are able to showcase the many wonderful products produced from our alpaca fiber.
Raising alpacas has been a rewarding and enjoyable experience for our family. We have been fortunate to make some wonderful friends in the alpaca industry and continue to enjoy the many benefits of this business.

Good day LIB Addict, If you are a 2 mins man with a Tiny manhood only fit for kids, better read this story to the very end & take action. My name is Titi Davies, a banker, Married to Dr Segun Davies, and I have a dark confession to make.
A secret so powerful most “shy” women always hide from men, the worst part is they make these men think that all is well!
If you are a man who is either married or in a relationship, and down below you are just 4ich my brother, there is fire on the mountain for you!
You have to step up your “Egg Plant” game and find a way to last long, or risk your woman gisting her friends who will laugh at you when you walk pass them!

Before you keep reading, know that this must Exactly what an AVERAGE wife or girl-friend must be going through if you are not a man that can fire her well on BED 100%, as you are meant to.
And I must confess , even though Segun is a man of ANY woman’s dream, he lacks one very important thing that many women publicly accept…
But….what he Lacks is a very VALUABLE thing most women will cherish More than all the Riches of life…
For good 4 Years of Marriage, I was sexless, in short my friends call him a “Castrated Limp” during this period.
For the first 2 Years of terrible sex life, I was behaving like a mad woman, I think it’s because I was NEVER satisfied when ever we have sex , and studies shows that if a woman is not satisfied, she is plunged into an Emotional imbalance.
My friends noticed this and advised me to better look for a “Sugar Boy” to “Service me” so I will feel alright.
But I was behaving like a mad woman, always angry and moody…cos there was no man to take away my sorrow….sensually!
You see…it’s very easy for us women to pretend like everything is okay in our bedroom life when we are braking down like price of naira to dollar.
The worst part is that Segun was so obsess with a new business he is building, and he was not performing well!
There was no day without a meeting, the weekends were spent virtually at his office, rarely does he have time for me!
When I was Horny & Lonely with no one to drill me honey pot, I will slide into Twitter and Facebook to rant about how men with small blokos and 2 mins manliness are more dangerous than men who have it and cheat.
Remi pierce my heart with his sweet talks of how big his “mamba” was & how he could last as long as 45 mins during sex!
The worst part is Uncle Segun, get’s back from office & start gisting me about the (boring) this that happened to him at office then go to bed.

The price of finishing the degree nowadays is actually shamefully a lot more than the price of a typical American’s Mortgage. Prior to each and every educational 12 months, the actual planks as well as administration committees associated with colleges round the country boost the college tuition price through regarding 1% in order to 5%. Recently, UCLA college students required towards the roads in order to demonstration a choice associated with growing their own educational costs through 5% every year, for that following 5 many years. I actually do not really fault all of them whatsoever. These types of college students possess each and every correct to do this. The typical United states university move on has become graduation by having an typical mortgage associated with $26, 000. With regard to college students that select to visit mediterranean or even regulation college, this particular determine might improve through a lot more than 100%. And may all of us actually care talk about the task marketplace, such as associated with as soon as envied professions for example Regulation? Crickets. The actual large issue here’s how the work marketplace is actually seriously soaked at this time which is becoming more and more hard with regard to youthful graduates to locate work, particularly if these people majored in many generous disciplines levels. Therefore what now ? whenever your beginning income correct from university is actually $30, 000 annually however, you come with an $85, 000 university mortgage? The simple truth is which as part of your, mother and father have to be really rigid regarding their own kid’s educational options. Eliminated would be the times where college students just visited university in order to go after their own enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is excellent, however does it spend your own expenses? Exactly the same children a person escorted in order to university, is going to be returning to reside at the cellar for two much more many years if you don’t presume your own raising a child part as well as refuse financing their own bad options. Actually, a good worrying quantity of United states College students generally return to reside using their mother and father following graduating simply because they can’t merely pay for to pay for their own month-to-month prices as well as purchase their own individual costs. You have in order to very carefully assess the monetary results of the educational options. We highly think that college students ought to acquire financial loans only when really required. Here are some tips associated with identifying regardless of whether purchasing university financial loans may be beneficial.
1) Obtaining a mortgage associated with $80, 000 in order to go after a diploma ever or even additional generous disciplines levels is merely not really wise. However, obtaining the exact same quantity of mortgage for any pharmacy or even a good architectural level can be a great expense since the monetary results associated with graduates is actually fairly higher. ORIGINATE level graduates usually convey more profession possibilities as well as greater beginning wages compared to additional areas. No ORIGINATE areas for example Sales or even Company can also be monetarily satisfying in some instances. College students that move on along with generous disciplines levels for example Sociology generally discover that they’ll require a greater level in order to actually be looked at with regard to entry-level work, therefore gathering much more financial debt. You might end up getting large financial loans which often consider many years to become repaid. Select sensibly.
2) Main within some thing you like however that will additionally cause you to a full time income as well as small inside your enthusiasm. I really like performing as well as dance however We definitely would not main in a of these areas. We definitely realize that graduation having a dancing level might have experienced me personally waiting around furniture simply because to tell the truth, the number of work perform dance majors have? Caring some thing might not be the sensible cause in order to main inside it. The task marketplace is extremely callous and several graduates find on their own employed in work that need merely a senior high school level. Considering it, the best performers, stars, journalists, writers as well as creative designers in no way truly visited college to review their own areas. These people proved helpful from mastering their own abilities as well as looking for possibilities. If you wish to adhere to your own no valuable enthusiasm, make use of your own additional courses or even sign up at the neighborhood university as well as have a couple of programs. If at all possible, dual main. For example, the songs main may decide to dual main along with company or even sales, which might improve their own marketability within the work marketplace.
3) For many households, the university training is merely costly as well as nearly not possible without having financial loans as well as We totally realize that. We compensated my personal method via college and so i experienced to determine the least expensive path personally to complete my personal training. Visit a neighborhood university for that very first 24 months or even sixty credit since it is a lot less expensive than the usual four 12 months organization.

Bays are No. 1 in statistics, but when it comes to stars, Bayhawks outrank them - tribunedigital-baltimoresun
The Maryland Bays coach doesn't know how his team is going to react to all the pomp and circumstance surrounding tonight's 8:05 game with the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks for the American Professional Soccer League championship at Boston University's Nickerson Field.
"We're not used to getting into a town two days ahead of the game and then having a press conference before a packed room," said Caringi yesterday. "We usually fly into a city the day of the game and leave right afterwards. We were ready to play Thursday, but we still had two days to wait. The wait and all the hype is what concerns me more than the four weeks' layoff we've had."
It has been four weeks since the Bays captured their first American Soccer League championship with a 2-0 victory over the Fort Lauderdale Strikers. Caringi and the Bays believe that earned them much respect in the professional outdoor soccer world.
The Bays have more impressive credentials than San Francisco Bay, the Western Soccer League champion.
Maryland had a 19-5 overall record compared with the Blackhawks' 16-8 mark, the Bays outscored San Francisco in 20 regular-season games (42-39), the Bays allowed fewer goals in 20 games (29-30), and Maryland's top three scorers (Phillip Gyau, Jean Harbor and Rob Ryerson) had a total of 27 goals and 16 assists compared with 17 goals and 12 assists for San Francisco's top three of Steve Corpening, Townsend Qin and Marcelo Balboa.
However, it was San Francisco's two World Cup players, forward Eric Wynalda and defender Balboa, who stole the show.
"All the hype in the pre-game press conference was about the two San Francisco national team players," said Caringi. "That's all anybody wanted to talk about. But that's fine with us. Our league is considered stronger [Fort Lauderdale won the APSL title last season], and that says a lot."
Caringi said he would put defender Joey Barger on Wynalda and that Balboa would have to worry about stopping Gyau and Harbor.
"I'm confident that Joey can handle Wynalda," said Caringi. "Joey did a good job on David Byrne [Tampa Bay Rowdies forward and former Baltimore Blast standout] and has proven himself against the best players in our league."
Gyau (11 goals, six assists) and Harbor (nine goals, eight assists) are speedy forwards with explosive scoring ability.
"Jean Harbor's the best forward in the country," said Caringi. "He's big [6 feet 2, 185 pounds], strong, fast and has a rocket shot. He's also very good in the air. Very few teams have been able to stop him and Phillip. We're going to turn them loose against San Francisco."
NOTES: If the Bays win, they would face the Vancouver 86ers for the North American pro soccer championship Wednesday at 10:30 p.m. at Swangard Stadium in Burnaby, British Columbia. . . . The 23 APSL owners are meeting in Boston this weekend to chart the future of the league. ASL commissioner David Prouty said yesterday that he will resign next month because he doubts there will be sufficient funds to maintain his salary next season if the league loses three of its 11 teams. He predicts the ASL will have eight teams that will play 14 games each and that the league office, based in Jessup, will have its budget cut from $430,000 to $300,000.
Outlook: Key matchups in the American Professional Soccer League title game are: forward Jean Harbor against San Francisco defender Marcelo Balboa, forward Phillip Gyau against San Francisco defender Troy Dayak, San Francisco forward Eric Wynalda against defender Joey Barger and San Francisco forward Steve Corpening against defender Chris Reif.
NEW YORK -- The Clinton administration held its first high-level meeting with Vietnam yesterday in what Vietnamese officials hope may be a prelude to a quick lifting of the U.S. trade embargo against Hanoi.
In a session that was not announced, Assistant Secretary of State William Clark and other U.S. officials met in Washington for talks with Vietnam's outgoing ambassador to the United Nations, Trinh Xuan Lang.
A Vietnamese official said that Winston Lord, who is awaiting confirmation as President Clinton's assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific, also participated in the talks with the Vietnamese ambassador, but the State Department would not confirm this.
Clinton administration officials are believed to be trying to work out their policy toward Vietnam and a possible lifting of the long-standing U.S. trade embargo within the next six weeks.
They are facing a deadline of late April, when the International Monetary Fund is scheduled to decide whether to take steps toward resuming a long-frozen lending program to Vietnam.
Last fall, the Bush administration took several steps toward normalization of relations with Vietnam, after getting what U.S. officials considered to be unprecedented help from Hanoi in identifying Americans who had been listed as missing in action since the Vietnam War.
JUDY NEIGHOFF OF Churchton wants Anne Arundel County to dredge Broadwater Creek, which she says has silted up since she bought her waterfront home 30 years ago.
Neighoff said the creek has gone from about 15 feet deep to 2 feet deep. "We have to watch for the tides," to get a boat into the creek, she said.
Neighoff contacted the county, but officials need to hear from more than one person before they consider a dredging project.
Now Neighoff is seeking input from her neighbors. She has heard from about 40 people who own property on the water, and she wants to hear from Churchton folks who do not own waterfront property but use one of the three community piers.
With those words, 5-year-old Karenna Peacock chose her family's Christmas tree last week at Friendship Trees in Friendship. Karenna and her parents, Leslie and Kenneth Peacock of Annapolis, took home a 5 1/2 -foot-tall Douglas fir.
Douglas firs are a common choice at Friendship Trees, but the most popular choice is the Fraser fir, said owner Floyd Thiel.
He plans to close for the season on Wednesday or Thursday after selling about 400 trees during the weekend.
Deck the Halls is doing a brisk business in artworks and crafts made by local artisans -- more than $1,000 worth so far.
By the middle of last week, 23 pieces had sold at the annual holiday show at the Maryland Hall for the Creative Arts.
"We sold things that were $6 and we sold some things that were several hundred dollars," said Don Elliott, director of programs for the Maryland Hall.
Among the items sold were pieces by Deborah Harris, John Jensen and Marion LaMoal of Annapolis; Frank Amigo of Crownsville; and Ray Lopes of Millersville.
The show runs through Saturday. Hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, until 8: 30 p.m. Thursday, and 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday.
Tracys Landing sculptor Kelly Richard has collaborated with the Shady Side Rural Heritage Society to produce the fourth in a series of tree ornaments in honor of Shady Side's past.
Richard, who used to make similar ornaments for several organizations, said her Annapolis shop -- the League of Maryland Craftsmen on Maryland Avenue -- and another shop in Frederick keep her "so busy I'm sort of out of the ornament business except for Shady Side."
It happens from time to time. A kernel of hope will live in vials and petri dishes for years. There it will be nurtured, doubted, prodded, studied. Mice will be sacrificed. Scientists will spend their days and nights working on it.
Then, suddenly, a door is set ajar, and hope makes a run for it. It escapes into the public air and expands in that heady atmosphere until it seems ready to burst.
This time, the latch was popped by a front-page New York Times article that used the words "cure" and "cancer" in the same heady breath.
This time, hope came from evidence that a new therapy has cured cancer in mice. It came from the testimonial of the irrepressible James Watson of DNA fame who said, "Judah is going to cure cancer in two years."
"Judah" is Judah Folkman, known here in his hometown as much for being a mensch -- the Yiddish word for a good human being -- as for being a scientist. For 30 years, against skepticism and even self-doubt, he worked on a simple theory: Instead of killing a tumor, can you starve it to death? Can you stop the blood flow that feeds cancer?
His laboratory's striking success with angiogenesis inhibitors -- drugs that stop the blood flow to tumors -- had been reported for months. It was written about in Nature and in newspapers such as my own Boston Globe. It was talked about wherever oncologists meet to discuss and dissect progress.
But this time hope ran hand in hand with hype. The words "cure" and "cancer" spread in the fertile petri dish of the media culture. People heard the cure but not the caveats.
On Wall Street, investors who speculate on medical breakthroughs the way the Dutch once speculated on tulips turned from last week's hot stock, Pfizer, the maker of Viagra, to this week's hot stock, EntreMed. The price of the biotech company licensed to develop these drugs went from $12 a share to a high of $83.
And among those who have much more than their 401(k) at stake, the market in hope ran to even more dizzying heights. At the National Cancer Institute, in oncologists' offices and on the Internet, those who have heard "there's nothing we can do" began looking for a second opinion. Cancer patients calculated how long they could hold on till "the cure." A year, two.
As predictably as bear market follows bull, the brakes were applied to this rush. James Watson complained that he didn't say there'd be a cure in two years -- or perhaps didn't mean to. Oncologists reminded us that it would be years until the tests were done and the results were in. Judah Folkman warned against the belief that the new therapy "will emerge as stand-alone drugs of unprecedented power."
But the story of this escapee says much about what happens when hope breaks out as it does these days with the frequency and suddenness of a news report.
We live now on the cusp of cures. Cures for AIDS, for diabetes, for cancer. We don't know at any given moment when the latest promise will be the next success -- another Salk vaccine -- or the next disappointment -- another Interferon 2. One week, tamoxifen is touted as preventing breast cancer; the next week, angiostatin and endostatin are seen as cures.
Science is practiced in public. The understandable urgency of a patient conflicts with the necessary patience of a researcher. So the story of this "cure for cancer" is the clearest example yet of our two cultures: hope and science.
Today, hope springs and science treads deliberately, checking its footsteps. Hope goes for the light and science, as Mr. Folkman said, goes down "countless blind alleys to find one that goes through."
Hope talks of breakthroughs and science is as deliberate as the researcher in Mr. Folkman's lab who had to collect 50 gallons of mouse urine drop by drop.
What do we know from this latest report? Two things: that it's a long, long way from mouse to man and that we may be on the right path.
Today, somewhere, a man dying of cancer has read that there is a book in the works about Mr. Folkman's therapy. The book is titled: "Conquering Cancer."
Tennis: Leslie Harvey practically grew up on the Druid Hill Park courts. Today, she plays in the USTA Women's Satellite tourney there.
Leslie Harvey is a vivacious 18-year-old with a blistering forehand. It's the forehand that helped earn her a wild-card selection into the main draw of this week's USTA Women's Satellite tournament at Druid Hill Park.
It is her experience and knowledge of the local courts that may help her survive past the first round that begins today.
"She has known these courts since before she was born," said Leslie's mother, Marie, an administrative assistant at Old Court Middle School. "Her dad was out here playing in a tournament the week before she was born, and I was sitting in the stands cheering for him."
Marie Harvey laughs. She has been watching tennis from the stands for 20 years, as she first supported her husband, Ponell, assistant principal at Woodbourne School, and then took her daughter to tournaments all over the country.
"I'll be out here this week supporting my baby," she said, knowing when Leslie leaves for college this fall, she'll be continuing her supporting role for daughters Ashley, 11, and Elizabeth, 16, who also play the game.
The Satellite Tour of Baltimore was to begin play in the main draw at 10 a.m. today at Druid Hill Park and Greenspring Racquet Club. The finals are Sunday.
A total of 32 women, including four from qualifying rounds held yesterday and Sunday, will play in the main singles draw, and 16 players will compete in doubles.
Leslie Harvey was selected as a wild-card entry by tournament director David Owens, who also is executive director of the Head Urban All-Star Tennis Academy, a nonprofit tennis program for urban children.
Owens is trying to help develop the next Pam Shriver. He looks at the rise of the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, Chanda Rubin and, most recently, Alexandra Stevenson's reaching the Wimbledon semifinals, and knows their success is having an impact on his program.
"I guarantee you, they're the reason we have a women's satellite tournament here," Owens said. "Our kids can see people just like them. They can say, `I have braids in my hair and I have beads in my hair, just like them.' And they're educated. Tennis has become viable. It's something our young people can strive for."
When Leslie Harvey was 5, she rushed onto the tennis court to hit the ball with her dad. Today, she remembers how much fun that was and how thrilled she was to be able to hit the ball over the net.
"It wasn't until I was about 14, when I was ranked fifth and played in a Mid-Atlantic [regional] tournament and then went to Atlanta for the hard-court nationals that I thought about really being serious about playing," said Leslie, who is coached by her dad.
Last year, she won the American Tennis Association's national 18-and-under championship and the 1998 Maryland State High School championship. She didn't try for the state title this year, choosing instead to attend her senior prom.
She graduated from Randallstown High this spring and will attend Long Island University on a full tennis scholarship and study for a degree in physical therapy.
This summer she is working as a camp assistant for Liberty Road Recreation and Parks at Deer Park Middle School, helping teach math, reading, science and language arts to children between the ages of 5 and 12.
After work, she comes to Druid Hill to practice her tennis game for about three hours every day. She also lifts weights and tries to run sprints five times a week.
"I accepted resumes and chose Leslie because she was born and raised on these courts and because this experience can help her as she moves up the ladder," Owens said. "She's gold. She's got a great attitude. She's God-fearing and unassuming. Now, on the court, all bets are off. She has a forehand to die for, and she has excellent court savvy and a very aggressive game."
Leslie, 5 feet 4 -- a height she defends as being taller than professional player Amanda Coetzer -- is eager to reward Owens' faith.
"I was very surprised to be picked, but I really wanted to play," she said. "I've been working really hard, and my goal is to get past the first round. You know, seeing Wimbledon earlier this month and seeing how well Alexandra Stevenson did has given me a lot of courage.
"No one had ever heard of her and no one had ever done what she did and she was 17 -- just like me," said Leslie, who turned 18 last weekend.
MARGARET M. KENNEDY, of Coal Valley, IL, formerly of Baltimore, died Sunday, April 3. She was the daughter of John N. Paulus and Margaret Ellen Brooks Paulus. She was preceded in death by her husband, Edwin J. Kennedy. She is survived by her five children and their spouses: Ed and Kendra Kennedy of Moline, IL, Peggy and Frank Mason of Memphis, TN, Patty and Rick Hudson of Columbus, GA, Eileen and Larry Hudson of Matamoras, PA and Michael and Cyndi Kennedy of Davenport, IA, 15 grandchildren and her sister, Virginia E. Phelan of Baltimore. Remembrances and condolences may be shared with the family atwww. Trimble Funeral Homes.com
In two applications sent earlier this week, Newport Beach asked the California Coastal Commission for permission to install digital parking pay stations in the lots at Corona del Mar State Beach and the Balboa Pier.
The City Council in February put aside $440,000 to transition those lots to automated payment systems. Previously, they had been staffed by parking attendants.
A staff report from that time said the city planned to install about a dozen pay stations at each parking lot by Memorial Day. The city operates 614 parking spaces in the Balboa lot and 517 spots at the Big Corona lot.
The new kiosks will allow beach visitors to make their payments in a variety of ways, including by cell phone, staff reports have said.
The Coastal Commission is tasked with determining whether development projects will infringe on public access to coastal areas.
According to both applications, "The city of Newport Beach believes that [the pay station installation] constitutes de minimis development."
In other words, because the 23 total kiosks will make up a "combined footprint" of less than 29 square feet, and because they will be placed "in the existing landscaped planters and hardscaped areas" bordering the lots, their installation won't make much of a difference in terms of access.
"These pay stations will be no more intrusive than the waste containers also placed there for the beach-user's convenience," the applications say.
The California Coastal Commission next meets from Aug. 14 to 16 in Santa Cruz. The agenda for that meeting has not yet been released, however, so it is unclear whether consideration of the applications will be on it.
Gretchen Hoffman NORTHEAST GLENDALE -- Glendale Police are looking for two men who robbed a taxi driver, then made him drive them back to Hollywood. The taxi driver picked up two men in Hollywood. They gave him directions to Scholl Canyon Park at about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday, according to the police report.

Here is a case where the Court clearly did the right thing. In December 1998, Mary Ingham, a brittle-boned, cane-carrying diabetic who is physically disabled, called the Luxor Cab Company for a ride. Traffic was heavy that morning, and the cab driver grew frustrated and eventually ordered Ms. Ingham to pay for that part of the ride that had been completed; however, he told her to exit his cab so he could get to his coffee shop and meet his friends. This was a full two blocks from the dentist's office she was attempting to visit.

GLENDALE — A man who allegedly tried to rob a downtown Citibank on Tuesday after arriving by taxi was able to evade police, officials said. The man was dropped off about 4:12 p.m. outside the Citibank on the 700 block of North Brand Boulevard and asked the taxi driver to wait while he went inside the bank, Glendale police Sgt. Tom Lorenz said. The man approached a bank teller and passed a demand note, but his attempt was unsuccessful, Lorenz said. Instead of returning to the taxi, the man left through the back exit and fled on foot, Lorenz said.
I clearly remember my first April 24 experience. I could not have been any older than 7 or 8 when my mom took me to a protest that was organized at the grounds of our neighborhood Armenian church. I even remember the taxi driver. He was a middle-aged Iranian man with a heavy 5 o’clock shadow. As he pulled up to the gates of the St. Sarkis Church in Tehran, he was puzzled by the dense and vociferous group of protesters. He asked (in Persian): “What are you Armenians protesting against?
One evening last week, I found myself completely exhausted. This is not always true at 5 p.m. But as I glanced at the clock, I felt a tinge of envy as I thought of my friends who are either single or have older children. I often hear of them going to bed early when they are tired. But alas, I myself had dinner to cook, dishes to wash, three baths to oversee, homework to help with, lunches to pack and clothes to set out for the next day. I was worn out and reflected upon how Mother's Day is approaching.
I absolutely agree with your view regarding taxi service at our airport (“Council should countermand taxi decision,” Sept. 18). The drivers are disrespectful and angry all the time! My husband and I also played the same guessing game upon getting into a taxi at the airport. After having our luggage literally thrown on the sidewalk, I called officials. I explained that I understood the driver's concern (“Airport taxi minimum fare is raised,” Sept. 18) and recommended having two taxi lines.

A contentious proposal to tightly restrict the location of new oil and gas wells in Colorado attracted more than enough petition signatures to qualify for the November ballot, according to election officials.
The measure, known as Initiative 97, is certain to ignite an expensive and high-stakes battle over how much control state and local governments can exert over one of the state's most powerful industries.
Backers submitted an estimated 123,000 valid signatures, well over the 98,492 required, Secretary of State Wayne Williams said.
The measure would require that new oil and gas wells be at least 2,500 feet from occupied buildings and “vulnerable areas” such as parks, creeks and irrigation canals. It would allow local governments to require greater setbacks.
Supporters said bigger setbacks would better protect people and the environment, especially from fracking, or hydraulic fracturing.
“We're just absolutely thrilled that safer setbacks from fracking will be on the ballot this November,” said Micah Parkin, a board member with Colorado Rising, the initiative's primary backer.
“This measure will devastate the state of Colorado by destroying nearly 150,000 jobs over the next decade, eliminate billions in state revenues, and negatively impact essential services such as health care, education, transportation, fire and safety,” said Chip Rimer, chairman of Protect Colorado, an industry-backed group.
A state analysis said the measure would place 85 percent of non-federal land in Colorado off-limits to drilling. An oil and gas advocacy group warned in June that taxpayers could face billions of dollars in compensation claims because energy companies would not be able to extract and sell privately owned reserves.
Both the Democratic candidate for governor, Jared Polis, and his Republican opponent, Walker Stapleton, have said they oppose the measure.
Setbacks are the subject of fierce debate in Colorado, where drilling rigs and storage tanks intermingle with schools, homes and hospitals, especially in the urban Front Range corridor north of Denver.
The secretary of state's office estimated the number of valid signatures by examining a 5 percent sample of the nearly 173,000 submitted. That is standard practice for this type of ballot measure, said Julia Sunny, a spokeswoman for the office.
Opponents have not ruled out a challenge to the signatures, said Karen Crummy, a spokeswoman for Protect Colorado.
In late August, the secretary of state's office said a separate measure backed by the oil and gas industry had drawn enough signatures to get on the November ballot.
Initiative 108 would make it easier for property owners to seek compensation from the government for actions that diminish their property's value. Supporters say it could be used if expanded setbacks prevent drilling for oil and gas.
The Colorado Municipal League has warned it would unleash litigation over all sorts of claims, including zoning changes, and taxpayers would have to pay for it.
History was made in Arvada when the constituents of House District 27 elected Democrat Brianna Titone, the first transgender representative elected to the Colorado House of Representative.
It came down to the wire. Jeffco Schools Superintendent Dr. Jason Glass called it a “Hail Mary.” On Election Night, the measure was down more than 8,000 votes, but as more votes were counted in the days that followed Election Day, the gap between those wanting to fund the $567 million bond for Jefferson County Public Schools and those not, narrowed.

braganza design/ GROUP is a full-service architecture and planning firm located in Memphis, Tennessee. Our staff is comprised of experienced, dedicated, licensed professionals. Like many Memphis design firms, braganza design/ GROUP (formerly Braganza Associates. P.C.) shares a common pedigree with notable historic Memphis architectural firms dating back almost 50 years. After completing his architectural education in 1960 from Liverpool University in England, Claude Braganza started his architectural career at the Office of Walk C. Jones Architects in 1961. He collaborated with Francis Mah on numerous award winning projects such as the First Tennessee Bank Building and Southern College of Optometry. In 1971, Claude began working for Francis Gassner at Gassner Nathan Browne, Architects-Planners (1971-1977) where he became a partner and developed a life-long friendship with Mr. Gassner (who the local AIA Memphis Chapter named it’s most prestigious award after for outstanding contributions to the quality of Memphis’s built environment).
Upon Mr. Gassner’s untimely death in 1977, Claude Braganza was a founding partner in the spin-off firm Browne/ Wilkinson/ Braganza Associates (1977-1984). In 1984, Mr. Braganza incorporated Braganza Associates, P.C. Architects as a Professional Architectural Corporation with a longstanding mission to not only design quality environments, but to build and cultivate long term relationships with our clients as well as our consultants.
In an effort to continue the firm’s legacy, Braganza Associates, P.C. welcomed two longstanding employees, Wendy Gross, AIA and Chris Norton, AIA as partners in 2008. They have worked in the Memphis Architecture Community for almost 40 years combined. Under their leadership, Braganza Associates, P.C. will maintain its commitment to enhance the built environment through thoughtful, innovative and budget-minded design.
The Assam Co-operative Apex Bank Ltd had to take up financing of the Tea Gardens in 1950 due to non- availability of proper finance to the Indian owned small and medium sized gardens from other financing agencies. During the economic crisis in the Tea Industry in 1952, when many indigenously owned gardens were refused finance by commercial Banks and were on the verge of closure, Sri Subhramaniyam Naidu , then Chief Officer, Agricultural Credit Department, RBI came to Shillong in the 1st Part of November 1952 and held discussion with the state Government and the Apex Bank officials for financing such Tea Gardens. In 1953, the Government of India selected this Bank as one of the 9(nine) Banks in India to provide Finance to the Tea Estates under a scheme of Government Guarantee. The Apex Bank’s entry into the field of Tea Finance gave immense relief to the indigenously owned tea gardens in the state as otherwise many of them would have been closed as a result of the slump in the tea market during 1952.
Post 1964, Apex Bank continued financing the tea gardens through a society called the Assam Tea Planters Co-operative Society Ltd. Subsequently since 1973, the member gardens of the said Assam Tea Planters Co-op. Society Ltd started availing direct finance from the Apex Bank.
The Bank continued to finance the Tea Sector till the year 2005. Then the Tea Sector in Assam faced a major recessionary period and as a result large number of tea gardens defaulted. To erase the rise of NPA, the Bank restricted itself from financing the Tea Sector & has been continuing to give more stress on the recovery aspects of the tea loans.
Proceedings under Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002 .
A Board Level Tea Loan Monitoring Committee comprising of 3(three) Board of Directors and Managing Director of the Bank was constituted to look into each and every aspects of Tea Loan Recovery.
Friday was a sad day , no, make that a shocking day in the webcasting community. On Friday, the Copyright Royalty Board finalized the webcasting royalty rate based on a cost per play, with a 500 dollar minimum per channel , while also completely eliminating any percentage of revenue options. In a nutshell it was the day the internet music died.
Rather than going through the entire obituary, I will defer to KurtHansons wonderful RAIN site for all the gory details.
I remember setting up servers from progressive networks and xing to stream AudioNets first station, KLIF in 1995. I remember creating Christmas stations, Elvis stations and letting people program their own internet radio station. Then as with now, the vast majority of streaming took place during the day in the office.
Everything that is happening with video now, happened first with audio. Below isnt pretty, but its a reminder of where we started .
Kurt Hanson and the band of small webcasters had their chance in 2005 and 2006. They failed to impress anyone then, and they failed to do the \”math\” required. Yes, this is bad, but they did a horrific job articulating to the CRB and this sealed their case. Now it is TOO late. Also, read the ruling…the channel fees are recoup-ble against royalty payments, and thus, insignificant. Please don\’t listen to Kurt, as he is most often wrong. Instead, follow the actions taken by the CRB, the labels, artists, and webcasters. They had their chance. As an investor in media and content companies…DO THE MATH…PLEASE! AND, DO IT WHEN IT IS IMPORTANT. NOT AFTER THE RULING.
Mark, as usual, you were ahead of the curve on this. I received Rain\’s update email, and then read the Royalty Rates that were finalized by the CRB. Rather than be overcome by sadness, I will try to strategize a fitting response.
The RIAA has, by virtue of their successful lobby efforts, once again made sure that the Artists are paid some fractional amount, while both limiting the exposure for the Artists and protecting Radio Terra Firma.
It will be up to a large and strong group of Artists who determine that, rather than allow a Major Label to license their material to select markets, the Artists can restrict said licensing .
If U2, Tom Petty, Aerosmith and Greenday ( or pick \’em )decided to start the movement, by licensing exclusively to Internet and Satellite Radio, on an exclusive basis, they would get paid, played and exposed to fans with a minimum of commercial involvement .
Wait. Does that include music use in videos? If yes, the prices mentioned by Kurt Hanson seem to be quite low actually.
I just calculated one of my favorite videos on Google Video that uses a song for a karoke type video. 6,612,126 views as of now x $0.0011 per performance = $7,273.34. While this seems to be expensive, we should put it into perspective:
Even if Google gets just a CPM of $2.00, they still have a revenue of $13,224.25 and a profit of $5,950.91
I think this pricing is fair. It gives every blog owner a chance to at least break even (i.e. do not lose money on his blog) as long as it has some traffic.
You are correct. Another in a long line of \”sad days\” when it comes to recorded music these days. Last night I attended The Shins concert here in Dallas. I was trying to think the last time I heard a Shins song on a Dallas radio station. Never came to mind. If it were not for satellite or internet radio stations, artists such as this would not get the exposure to draw 4,000+ at a concert. Yet, if you were to ask them, they would want you to play your music as often as you would–and for free. Why, marketing! And yet, do the terrestrial stations pay these same rates. No.
The RIAA rails against DRM free music in the guise of artist protection. CARP makes it impossible for the small/mid webcaster to survive. Who is protected…not the artist. Sony, Universal, AOL, Yahoo, Clear Channel, etc are the ones that are protected Who loses. The artist and the music lover.

The wide expansion of cinemas, job creation potential and the availability of huge audience are some of the factors for the growth of the Ethiopian film industry in quantity, not in quality.
Study reveals that Ethiopian film industry is booming in terms of number not quality. Establishing strong training institutions would help make the industry more competitive and attractive.
The Ministry of Culture and Tourism co-organized a consultative forum Tuesday with the Ethiopian Film Professionals Association with the theme: “Films with Cultural Values for Renaissance.”
Presenting a paper on Ethiopian Films Prospects and Challenges, Wossenyeleh Tilahun noted that currently over 100 movies have been produced in a year thanks to the technology and the economic growth the country registered. The wide expansion of cinemas, job creation potential and the availability of huge audience are some of the factors for the growth of the industry, he added.
However, the films are produced without detail research, casting system, professional filmmakers and conducting feasible and risk assessment. Lack of attention and viable support from the government is also the other major hindrance, according to Wossenyeleh.
According to the study, some 60% of the respondents believe that the film industry has been growing in quantity but not in quality. Some 20% on the other hand say the industry is growing and the remaining have an opposite view.
Almost half of the films made this year are waiting to be released for long period of time due to lack of cinema houses and alleged corruption by managers. Some films have been released instead of the quality ones for some officials are allegedly receiving bribes.
“Ethiopian filmmakers have been invited to take part in various international film festivals but they fail to do so as they could not meet the international criteria,” he noted.
He recommended that government need to enact laws and establish special government institution that directly governs and supports the industry. The association must be strong in providing support to professionals in the sector.
According to the study, forums need to be organized to have discussion between the government and pertinent bodies to identify challenges and address them. Filmmakers are also expected fulfill their responsibility.
Currently, there are about 300 filmmaker enterprises and 39 cinema houses in Addis Ababa with the number of films showing 10 per cent growth..
Thorough discussion was held with participants on ways of improving Ethiopian film industry and overcoming the challenges and fulfilling responsibilities for a better future. The event was attended by various film professionals, directors, senior government officials and other pertinent bodies.

DutchAmsterdam.com — On June 3, 2007, American photographer Spencer Tunick realized on of his large-scale ‘human installatations’ in Amsterdam.
Tunick’s art projects consist of photo shoots in which all participants are naked. All of these installations are held in public locations.
Since 1994 he has photographed over 75 such projects in cities around the world, including New York, London, Barcelona, and Vienna. He set a record for naked photography with a photo of 18,000 people in the buff in Mexico City last year.
Settings included a large and rather stark parking garage, but a bike ride by hundreds of naked woman across a nearby bridge drew more attention.
Another shoot featured nearly two dozen women standing on a custom-built iron bridge across the Lauriergracht.
The bridge was designed to become invisible once people were standing on it, creating the illusion of a bridge consisting solely of human bodies.
“It was very exciting and I didn’t even feel shy,” one woman said. Other participants expressed similar sentiments.
Tunick is not surprised. “My work has nothing to do with sex or eroticism,” he told a local newspaper. “I create dreams and memories no one will forget. Of course it has something provocative, but that is mostly in the fact that all these people are in adam-costume at an unnatural location, in the middle of the city, a bulbfield, or a museum.”
“I rather use the naked body mostly as an abstract form. The nudity in part symbolizes freedom. But it is more than that. It also references ancient magical rituals as they existed in classic mystery games.”
“I get people to shed their inhibitions basically because the people shedding their clothing are interested in contemporary art,” Tunick told the Associated Press.
Incidentally, the location for the installation was closely guarded — standard procedure for the shoots so that the photo crew does not have to deal with hordes of uninvited onlookers.
Partipants were first met at 3:30 am –and where only then told at which locations the sessions would take place.
“It was very hard to find space in a city meant for such a small amount of people,” Tunick told De Telegraaf. “I was very lucky to get almost 2,000 to fill a massive car park.”
Life-size pictures of the shoot were later displayed on billboards at various locations throughout Amsterdam.
Spencer Tunick’s Amsterdam installation was the first in an annual series of art projects to be commissioned by DREAM AMSTERDAM
Tunick calls his models ‘city adventurers.’ “People from all walks of life participate in my temporary installations — as I call these actions, because they are not performances. I am not looking for an audience, but rather need participants. People willing to use their stark-naked bodies to form a super-sculpture.”
“It is certainly not only nudists who come and help me,” the artists says. “There are always lots of art students who participate, but also housewives, teachers, electricians….”
The photographer says there is a small group of fans who follow him around the world. “They apply for almost every project. I think that’s great, but I do not want famous faces in my pictures, so I kindly ask them to stand in the back. The same thing applies to people with tattoos that are too prominent, or ones whose bikini tan lines are too clear.”
Tunick himself stays fully dressed. Not that he is a prude, but experience has taught him that his camera kit bruises and cuts his body. “You’ll agree that a nude photographer wearing only a vest for his lenses and roles of film looks dorky,” he says.
Tunick, who last April already shot some pictures in the bulbfields near Amsterdam, is please that so many people applied for his Amsterdam installation.
A few years back he barely managed to attract 400 people for a shoot in the Dutch city of Breda. But that was before he gained notoriety and become popular. He has been doing mass nude photo shoots since 1994. His breakthrough came when famous British collector Charles Saatchi commissioned him for a creation. Since then countless museums for modern art have sought him out.

Dental-assisting students at Hagerstown Community College recently gave a dental awareness presentation to fourth-grade students at Maugansville Elementary School.
The presentation focused on cavity awareness, healthy nutrition for teeth and the dangers of smoking and smokeless tobacco. The presentation also included demonstrations on tooth brushing and flossing.
“Giving this presentation was a great way for HCC’s dental assisting students to teach fourth-graders about the importance of taking care of their teeth and the harmful effects of drugs and tobacco,” said Theresa Marks, HCC instructor, dental assisting/hygiene. “It was a great opportunity for students to do some community service.”
Students who participated in the presentation included Allison Flynn of Boonsboro; Cassandra Aleshire, Anna Banca, Hannah Barton and Amy Snyder, all of Hagerstown; and Jennifer Yeakle of Hancock.

Exterminators hired by a homeowners group have put down one animal. Recently a girl was bitten at school and a woman threatened.
Residents of a neighborhood in the hills near San Clemente are upset that their homeowners association has hired hunters to trap and kill coyotes. An extermination company was hired this week after a coyote bit a grade-school student and several of the animals surrounded a woman, both within the past few months. So far one coyote has been killed.
Some residents said they are willing to accept the risks that come with living near the foothills and are more upset by the extermination plan than by the coyotes.
Jim Cox, the fire chief of Montebello and a resident of the Talega community, said he witnessed a killing early Tuesday morning while walking his dogs. He said the coyote -- trotting along a ridge -- stepped into a trap and injured itself as it struggled to get free.
Cox said he rushed home, got wire cutters and raced back to the trap to free the animal. But, Cox said, a man got out of a truck, threw a blanket over the animal and injected something into it before the animal became still.
"At first, I thought, 'Maybe it's a tranquilizer,' " said Cox. "I knew better, but that was my first hope."
Animal Pest Management was hired by the homeowners association to trap and kill aggressive coyotes over a 10-day stretch, said Patricia Minassian, vice president of the company that manages Talega under a contract with the homeowners association.
She said the plan was approved after several coyote incidents had been reported: One bit a girl at a San Clemente elementary school, and several coyotes surrounded a woman and her dog, who were rescued by a motorist who stopped and let them into his car.
"The action the board has taken at this time is a coyote management program that only identified the most aggressive coyotes that have become bold enough to leave their natural habitat and enter the human habitat," Minassian said.
The company has about 11 traps in the hills behind the homes. One coyote has been trapped and killed so far.
One resident said she is so distressed by the traps she plans to withhold her monthly association dues.
"Until they can provide me with a financial accounting that my money is not being spent to do something that I think is morally wrong, I'm not going to pay my dues," said Jamie Gable.
Gable is also worried that her children, who like to play in the hills behind her home, could get caught in one of the traps. "To think your child could get injured in a place that you assume to be safe is frightening," she said.
It is illegal to relocate them, according to state Fish and Game officials. And because coyotes are not endangered, no permits or approval is needed.

Police will use crime-mapping technology and aggressive enforcement after last week's beating, which left a Giants fan hospitalized. Limits on alcohol sales at the ballpark are also being studied.
The Los Angeles Police Department announced plans to bring aggressive crime-fighting tactics that it employs on city streets into Dodger Stadium as part of a security crackdown a week after a visiting fan was attacked in the ballpark's parking lot.
Overriding a Dodger policy against armed police inside the stadium, Police Chief Charlie Beck said Friday that uniformed officers will be posted throughout the ballpark and will be more aggressive about arresting or expelling people who cause trouble. Beck also said Dodgers owner Frank McCourt had agreed to pay for an increase in the number of LAPD officers patrolling in the stadium and the parking lots during and after games.
McCourt consented as well to create a computer mapping and crime tracking system for the stadium that is similar to the one the LAPD has used for years to scrutinize crime patterns and hotspots throughout Los Angeles. The department's computer analysis of crime data is considered by many criminologists to be a factor in the city's decline in crime over the last decade.
Improvements in surveillance and parking lot lighting are planned as well. And the Dodger organization has agreed to revoke the passes of season-ticket holders if they or their guests misbehaved, Beck said.
"If you come to intimidate, to antagonize … we're going to do one of two things," Beck said. "You're going to be thrown out of the stadium or you're going to get to go to jail."
The changes, which will take effect in time for the Dodgers next home game on Thursday, mark a turnabout for the team. McCourt said last weekend that he was satisfied with the team's security measures, saying "you could have 2,000 policemen there, and it's just not going to change that random act of violence."
But at a news conference Friday with Beck and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, McCourt said he fully supported a greater police presence and acknowledged hearing concerns from fans who felt unsafe at the stadium.
"I hear you loudly and I hear you clearly," he said. "We are going to redouble our efforts to make sure we fulfill our promise to the fans and all the citizens of the Greater Los Angeles area. We are going to provide a safe, family-friendly, fan-friendly environment at Dodger stadium. I promise you that."
McCourt deflected a question from a reporter regarding complaints from some fans that the atmosphere at the park has become more hostile in recent years. He also expressed skepticism that curbing alcohol sales would make a significant difference.
"I don't think it's the sale of beer that's a problem, per se. I think it's the abuse of that privilege," he said.
But Beck, in an interview, said he believed beer and alcohol consumption did, in fact, contribute to the problems at the stadium and said police officials were pushing the Dodgers to raise prices and stop sales at an earlier point in the games.
Dodger officials have told the LAPD that they are reconsidering their plan to sell half-price alcohol at six games this season. They also promised to look at prices and serving sizes for alcohol, as well as when to stop serving alcohol, according to Dodger spokesman Josh Rawitch.
Friday's announcement capped a week of increasing scrutiny for the ballpark. Last Thursday, as fans left the stadium after the Dodgers' opening day game against the rival San Francisco Giants, two men attacked 42-year-old Bryan Stow from behind. Stow remains in a medically induced coma and his doctors say he may have suffered brain damage. Detectives say they have received scores of tips and witnesses' accounts involving the two assailants. Various rewards have been offered for information leading to their arrest, totaling $150,000.
Villaraigosa urged the attackers to turn themselves in. "What you did was wrong. It was despicable and senseless, unprovoked. But, make it a little better, by coming forward, by doing what will be looked at in hindsight as doing the civil, right thing when you've done wrong," he said.
Beck attributed much of the problems at Dodger Stadium to "a fringe fan base" that is made up of gang members or troublemakers who dress and act the part. Dealing with them effectively, he said, will require bringing the LAPD's tough stance on street crime into the park. "There is an element of society that has adopted the Dodgers and who go to their games for all the wrong reasons," he said. "Can I fix that? Sure. I fix that the same way we're fixing the gang problem in Los Angeles."
The department deploys anti-gang units throughout troubled spots of the city. Those officers work exclusively on combating gang crime and develop intimate knowledge of the gang members who are active in their areas. Beck said he was considering using anti-gang officers at games, but expressed confidence that regular patrol officers would be effective in deterring problems.
The total number of LAPD officers to be deployed at games was still being determined. Beck declined to detail the types of behavior that would get a fan expelled from a game.
Members of a team of security experts hired by McCourt this week to make recommendations for additional safety improvements were expected to arrive at the park Friday. The team is headed by former LAPD Chief William J. Bratton, who now runs Kroll, an international security consulting firm.
Rawitch said the team would wait until Bratton completes his review before deciding whether to make public some or all of his findings.

CAPE CANAVERAL — Two people were hospitalized in stable condition Monday after they were injured when a charter fishing boat out of Port Canaveral hit a large swell.
Guna Watson, 58, of Salt Lake City, and Caroline Condon, 63, of Melbourne, were taken to Cape Canaveral Hospital in Cocoa Beach after the 9:15 a.m. accident aboard the Trade Winds V.
Watson suffered a fractured kneecap and Condon a fractured pelvis, a hospital spokesman said. The husbands of both women were treated for minor injuries.
A spokesman for the fishing charter said the swell might have been caused by a submarine surfacing. The four people were standing in the boat's bow when the accident occurred.

David Greenberg shares tips from his experience as Director of Marketing for Ted Kurland Associates, a boutique booking and management agency where Berklee interns gain insight into a successful career in music and business.
When I interview interns for the Ted Kurland Associates program, which I oversee here at TKA, more than a few want to know if they are going to work directly with the agents, or with management, as if the marketing side of it were tangential to their education, not only as an intern at TKA, but as a whole to their career. Of course, working with the artists is more interesting than working with the pictures of the artists; getting into the thick of the business of music is really the key to their understanding of the booking process. I know that, which is why I try and give them face time with the agents.
Hopefully Berklee-ites reading this will have a career where they can afford to shave off a nice percentage for a manager; one who understands all this tangential business kind of stuff and can honestly oversee the marketing. For nowadays, you need the right kind of marketing crew who knows how to use all the bleeding-edge tools-of-the-minute in order to shoot your career into the stratosphere, and, even more important, keep it there. Before you do, there is one basic term you need to understand. It’s not too hard to get, though I am perplexed when starving artists don’t even have this tool tucked under their belts. Perhaps that’s why they are starving?
Let’s start with the marketing term for today. It is AUDIENCE. As in those people who want to hear your music. To get gigs, you must have a loyal fan base. Clubs want to fill their rooms with paying customers so those customers can buy drinks, eat food, pay for all the stuff that gets called “overhead.” Don’t even expect to be considered by a promoter at a large club unless you have an audience that can minimally fill his room.
The very basic item you need for your marketing is your AUDIENCE. You need to get info to them, connect with them, keep them in your pocket. For that, you need to build a fan list — in a sortable database is best and you don’t have to go hog-wild – a spreadsheet is the simplest solution. I’m amazed that even the most-experienced and successful artists lack any method for building a fan database. Or if they do, I find they don’t capture fans at every concert. These are your loyal fans; they like you.They want to know more about you. They WANT to buy your music. They pay good money to see you play.
In today’s dollars, any money is good money, and you have to compete with so many other “good” things your fans need to have. Like breakfast. Or a donut. You should let them find you, be able to listen to you, easilly buy your music, come to your gigs, move your career along so that you can play those clubs. And to that end, you need to know who they are. Not intimately, but here’s the minimum: First Name, Last Name, Email Address, State, Zipcode. (Zipcode is the best to use to pinpoint audiences within a certain mile radius of a venue — record companies, promoters, and you will need this in the future, so start collecting it now.)
If you were a real mensch, you might want to have additonal columns to keep track of what they buy, how many times they buy tickets, etc. like the successful chain stores do every time you buy an item online or with a charge card.
You know why they do it? They want to know how they can give you the best incentives, keeping you coming back again and again and buy even more stuff to help them make a profit and stay in business to sell you more stuff. Yes, that’s crass and commercial but let’s break it down. In just one year a fan may see you five times, buy a tee-shirt and buy your CD or EP or a Download Card. That’s probably a total bill — with car fare, drinks, perhaps dinners — of over 100 dollars.
Look at it as they are buying your dinner, keeping the lights on, maybe even paying for a few pairs of socks, that donut, that breakfast, and sometimes sparking your creativity. So, why not gather your loyal fan base where you can keep in contact with them? Don’t think of it as crass and commercial. At the very least think of it as survival; at the very most think of it as a public service. These fans WANT your music. Why not give them the easy route to giving them what they want? And to do that you need to know who they are and how to contact them. Simple as that.
Start right now to create your fan list. A pad with some columns would do just fine. And make it worthwhile for everyone to sign up–some incentive for making your fans give it up for your career.
Some ideas: A raffle for a free t-shirt, a live download of your new song, an invite to a sound check and dinner with you the next time you are in town. There are all sorts of email marketing products that will also help you collect your lists with online widgets, and they make it easy to create professional-looking emails. I use Constant Contact for TKA and my freelance work for many reasons, but the biggest one is they do not charge you for the amount of emails you send, only a set price for the size of your list. (If you want to try them out, email me, and I’ll send you a link that could save you dineros if you decide to use them.) There are also some direct-to-fan platforms that handle this as well, Bandcamp, Sonicbids, Topspin and include other robust tools that help “indie” artists manage their careers.
Now getting to the gig part. You understand you need an audience in order to fill a club for a gig. And a loyal one as well. Dayla Santurri, General Manager of Scullers Jazz Club here in Boston has a “Door Gig” policy for musicians just starting out. Starting out artists can “four-wall” the room to showcase their talents. You pay for the room and market your butt off to get an audience. If you are really successful, you might be considered as a potential booking. If not, you still owe Scullers the cost for the room, which is $750.00. That’s a great deal for a room of that size, so great that it doesn’t cover all the costs of keeping Scullers room open on that night.
Scullers suggests a ticket price of no less than $20.00. Which means you need to sell 38 tickets just to break even. Even at that number, Dayla has seen the inevitable. “Some kids walk out of here with no money (or owing us money) because they did not heed the warnings to market their shows well.” Scullers does market the shows, gets the info into all the right places, and they are in a high-class hotel which could pull in a few impulse buyers, but Scullers has no built-in audience. No venue can build your audience- you have to.
And one rule of thumb that we email marketers heed is a successful email campaign is getting 10-15% of our list to actually follow through on an action. That’s not buying per-se, that’s just having them open up the email for an impression. The bottom-line? To get even a glimmer of a success at selling 38 tickets, and if you only used email marketing, AND your family didn’t buy up a scad of tickets? You will need a list with over 300 Bostonians alone. Dayla has seen a few successful groups who “actually did an amazing job getting friends and family out and some have cleared $2500. That is much more than any venue would ever pay them as a guarantee at this stage in their career.”
Get cracking on that list. By the way, Scullers has now instituted a new policy of advance ticket sales, as Dayla told me:
“Musicians were coming in night of show with no reservations at all for that night’s show and they’d not be bothered one bit, telling us that all their friends promised they would come. And then they don’t. No one shows up. That’s tremendously embarrassing for us all. So Scullers has now instituted a minimum for us to hold the show. If they don’t have 30 tickets sold by two weeks out the show is cancelled. This is unfortunate, but for us, it’s also a complete waste of time and money. The staff and I have an incredible amount of set-up work for a show and, importantly, it is also a waste of a date that should have gone to another deserving act.”
Now, if you were passed the level of four-walling it and are going on tour expecting play venues like Emo’s in Austin, you would have to be able to pack in a sizable audience just for them to consider you. Kevin Hoskins, the In-House Talent Buyer at Emos, gave me his basic numbers for the Inside room (300 capacity) at the club:
That’s $800 just to open the club and keep the lights on without one cent going to pay you. At eight to ten dollars a ticket, you will need to draw in a whole lot more than the minimum of 80 fans into the club if you want to be guaranteed any kind of fee by Mr. Hoskins. And, again, you will need a potential fan database with way over 800 emails who live within a 50 mile radius of Emo’s 78701 zip code.
Your audience is your lifeline. Your fan list is gold. Which gets my head shaking when bands don’t have some way to collect their fan info at gigs, online, wherever. And don’t even tell me that you have a Facebook fan page and a Twitter account. I have so many Facebook Events shooting at me from England and/or the Far East and/or even right here in Boston that I will never, ever, get to. Social media is great, but it is not efficient enough to be your only way to contact your fans.
Start a list. Use it well. Build your audience one fan at a time and capture their information anywhere and everywhere they are: at gigs, visiting your website, in your CDs, EPs, and on and on. When you have a good fan base who will pack a club and make them money, promoters will take notice. Get a massive audience and I bet those A&R dudes and dudettes will be calling you to get on the guest list with their “plus ones” the next time you play En-Why or El-Ay.

His background in this industry of entertainment has been a wild and bumpy ride, (some say with his own tacks littering the highway) best read on his Facebook or LinkedIn pages. A few tidbits: he was responsible for unleashing the first four Bill Hicks releases to the public for Rykodisc, proudly produced and sequenced the FZ Cheap Thrills compilation on which his credit was cheapened to “intramural sports” by the powers-that-had-been due to some brouhahahahahaha legalismo, and was a corpse, more than a few times, for his productions of Murder To Go live action mysteries, scripted and created by another Ithaca College alum, David Landau.
Great article Dave! You are absolutely right! It is all about building your fan base… your list is everything! I am finding the same is true for a new movie… it has gotten harder and harder to reach new fans, but once you have a website and can inspire people to share their email to watch a free movie or for bands, get a free mp3, you start building your list. The amazing thing is that once a buzz gets going you start increasing your fan base exponentially. People are coming to my movie site every day to watch REAWAKEN and I have no idea who they are or where they come from… what I do know is that I can now contact them with new offers for purchasing DVDs, books, or subscriptions. Lists are the key to doing good business, but on the creative side, you have to have produced great material!

In late April, the first-ever Mother Tongues Book Fair took place at Columbia University, organized by the Runasimi Outreach Committee at New York University and the New York-based Movimientos Indigenas Asociados in collaboration with the Institute for the Study of Human Rights and the Columbia Human Rights Graduate Group. Coinciding with the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues 2018, the fair celebrated written works in Indigenous mother tongues from various communities and geographic regions.
Languages represented at the fair included Amharic, Arikara, Crow, Hidatsa, Lakota, Mandan, Maya Mam, Mixteco, Nahuatl, Omaha-Ponca, Quechua, Tsou, and Zapoteca. Authors along with publishers displayed and sold a variety of mother tongue works including trilingual and bilingual children’s books, poetry anthologies, novels, zines, dictionaries, CDs, and more.
The fair’s goal was to raise awareness of Indigenous mother tongues and works as well as to connect authors and publishers with each other and the public. Some authors including Alem Eshetu Beyene from Ethiopia; Baitz Niahossa from Taiwan; Elva Ambia, Odi Gonzales, Rina Soldevilla, and Sandy Enriquez from Peru; as well as representatives from Hippocrene Books Inc., Grupo Cajola, the Endangered Language Alliance, Hawansuyo bookstore, La Zenka Sunqu and The Language Conservancy were present in person. A U.N. reporter from the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues also covered the event, interviewing the authors and Indigenous organizations on their perspectives and contributions to the fair.
Overall, the fair was a first-time success, serving as a space to value and honor Indigenous mother tongues and works written in them, a space that is too often not present in higher education institutions. This reality itself was central to the organization of the fair.
Indigenous languages have historically been excluded from curriculum, classrooms, and public places. Even today, schooling for Indigenous students will often take a “subtractive” form, in which the teaching medium is a dominant language of the society rather than an Indigenous language, effectively leading to the “transferring [of] their children to the dominant group,” according to an paper written for the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues by Ole Henrik Magga et al. This not only may have a negative effect on academic achievement of Indigenous children but also on language maintenance for an entire Indigenous community.
The proceedings from the Expert Group Meeting of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in 2016 declared that providing education in the Indigenous mother tongues improves educational outcomes and reduces dropout rates of Indigenous students. Furthermore, it contributes to the strengthening of Indigenous languages and creation of new generations of speakers.
To celebrate Indigenous languages and advocate for Indigenous language education alike, the U.N. General Assembly announced that 2019 will be the “The Year of Indigenous Languages.” UNESCO will lead this initiative to promote Indigenous languages, highlighting the significance of Indigenous peoples and critical role that Indigenous languages play in education, science, technology, and the future of Mother Earth.
The organizers of the first-ever Mother Tongues Book Fair hope to support this work, ensuring Indigenous people are at the forefront of these efforts by celebrating and collaborating with Indigenous authors for a second Mother Tongues Book Fair in 2019. Until then, please visit this year’s website to learn more about the 2018 event, or reach out if you are interested in getting more involved.

The Institute for the Study of Human Rights held its annual human rights career panel last month, offering students the chance to hear from individuals in a variety of human rights careers. The panel was an opportunity for future practitioners to gain insight into human rights in action outside of academic study at Columbia University.
The undergraduate and graduate students who attended the event held at Columbia’s International Affairs Building posed questions about their professional futures in human rights. The panelists, all career veterans in the field, helped answer student concerns by sharing stories about their career paths, their experiences, and other practical advice.

The panelists agreed that the human rights field can be complicated and frustrating at times. Victories don’t always happen, but it is important to be happy with the measurable successes that do occur. Sofia Coelho Candeias, a member of the UN Team of Experts on Sexual Violence and Rule of Law, said that accumulative successes are a huge source of pride over time: the results you want may not happen immediately, she said, but in retrospect successes do occur. In the DRC, where she works currently, for example, they went from zero police units for sexual violence in 2008 to 12 today.
Whether on a policy or field level, it is very rare to have the opportunity to make a real difference in any job, said Aida Martirous-Nejad, the special assistant to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights at the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in New York. “What job would I rather do?” she asked, speaking to the unique ability of a human rights career to impact real change through action, policy and community-building.
Rosalind McKenna, who works for the Open Society Foundation’s public health program chimed in to say how rewarding it is to support individuals so that they can may make their own voices and challenges heard. Yes, there’s a lot of bureaucracy in larger organizations, added Farnoosh Hashemian, a human rights lawyer in Iran. But you spend your time connecting with like-minded human rights defenders, all of whom are incredible people dedicated to their jobs, she said. Coelho concurred, saying that people who do public service tend to really like their job. Otherwise, they would all have to quit, she said.
The panelists answered student questions by sharing their experiences and advice. // Michelle Chouinard
Every human rights career is different, but there are definitely skills that come in handy, the panelists agreed. Every single person in the human rights field is there because they care deeply about human rights issues and are willing to “fight the uphill battle,” said Matthew Kennis, the program director of the Libertas Center, an organization located in New York City that provides medical, emotional and structural support to victims of torture. Kennis talked about what he would look for in a prospective applicant. He currently leads staffing for the Libertas Center. Important to him is the ability of the candidate to learn quickly. The candidate must have a genuine narrative of why they actually want to be there: how will they connect their interests to their career goals? Build yourself as a whole person, Kennis suggested. Trust the path that your career takes.
Coelho mentioned the importance of fieldwork, especially for young advocates just starting their careers. Each member of the panel spent a significant amount of time on their career journey doing fieldwork. Coelho also pinpointed kindness to others as the most important character trait needed in human rights jobs. Being open to listening to others is the only way you will survive in this field— you will get so much more done when you are kind to people, she said.
Martirious-Nejad also stressed optimism. In human rights work, you will be told “No!” nine times out of 10, she said, but you can’t be a pessimist in this work. You have to be able to adapt and move forward despite challenges.
Hashemian spoke of the fact that getting jobs in the field is highly competitive, but she encouraged students to persevere. All panelists agreed that networking is essential to success, along with development of interpersonal communication skills. Human rights is a team effort, and you’ve got to be a team player, said Hashemian. Humble, too, added Coelho. McKenna recommended taking the time to have a cohesive, polished CV and working on your ability to sell yourself as a person, not just as a list of achievements on paper. Other technical skills the panelists recommended include knowing at least two if not three or four languages. “Take immersion courses!” said Coelho.
The panelists offered advice on continuing studies in law school and pursuing fieldwork around the world. // Michelle Chouinard
McKenna, Coelho, Martirous-Nejad, and Hashemian all have law degrees. Broadly speaking, they said, law school is probably a good idea, even if you do not become a practicing attorney. The critical thinking skills alone are worth learning. Martirous-Nejad mentioned that because she is a lawyer, she has had more access to jobs than her peers who are not attorneys. The decision, however, is up to the individual student. Law school is costly. Perhaps do some fieldwork first, said Coelho, before committing to that investment.
Fieldwork is an integral part of a lot of human rights work, the panel said. Fieldwork can take place domestically or internationally, although often international work is the most common. You can look for jobs with larger organizations such as Amnesty International or the UN, says Hashemian, but you can also contact smaller local nonprofits in the location where you want to work.
Regarding the question of where to go based on geography or issue area, Coelho said, “What you want to do defines the field.” Sometimes, she said, issue areas are more important than a certain location. McKenna recommended that individuals looking for fieldwork check out the database of the Open Society Foundation (OSF), which has a list of the non-profits that OSF has funded.
Fieldwork will teach you to be humble and follow a leader, said Kennis. It is your chance to interact with those you’re helping directly on the ground, added Coelho. Yes, some places can be dangerous, as Hashemian pointed out, but you will receive security training and are often well cared for, especially when you focus on building strong relationships with the locals.
At the conclusion of the career panel event, students were offered some time to network with the panelists. It was clear that the panelists are enthusiastic and passionate about the work they do in the human rights field. The panel represented an invaluable opportunity for students to get a taste for what a future in human rights might be like.
Sofia Coelho Candeias is a member of the UN Team of Experts on Sexual Violence and Rule of Law. In this position, she focuses on sexual violence prevention and accountability in the DRC, CAR, Mali, Nigeria and Iraq. Her job frequently entails flying from the UN headquarters in New York to the various countries where she covers and surveys the status of sexual violence. She has spent significant time in the field, holding positions such as senior associate and criminal justice coordinator at the International Center for Transitional Justice, project manager of UNDP’s Women’s Access to Justice in the Eastern DRC, and coordinator of the Sexual Violence Unit of the European Union in the DRC.
Farnoosh Hashemian is a human rights lawyer who focuses on national security and human rights, constitutional reform, access to justice, and women’s rights. Also an author, she has written the book, “The Trial and Diary of Abbass Amir Entezam, the Longest-Held Prisoner of Conscience in the Middle East.” Growing up in Iran, Hashemian was an activist from a young age, always inclined toward justice and human rights. Currently, she works in Iran supporting various advocacy organizations and provides technical support to organizations in Afghanistan.
Matthew Kennis is the program director of the Libertas Center, located in New York City. He is also a graduate of the ISHR’s Master of Arts in Human Rights Studies program. The Libertas Center provides medical, emotional and structural support for victims of torture who are rehabilitating back into society. As director, Kennis hires people and supports and runs the Libertas advocacy work.
Rosalind McKenna works for the the Open Society Public Health Program within the Open Society Foundation (OSF), a philanthropic organization that supports governance for health, health rights and law. OSF funds health projects overseas. McKennna helps to find individuals, non-profits, and NGOs to whom OSF can provide funds. She has also worked as the coordinator for Amnesty International Ireland’s program on economic, social and cultural rights.
Aida Martirous-Nejad works as the special assistant to the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights at the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in New York. Much of her work takes place at the UN Headquarters where she covers Europe as a desk officer. Part of her job includes working toward integrating human rights language into codified national and international policy.

On January 24, Columbia University Institute for the Study of Human Rights hosted a discussion on the role and impact of the UN Human Rights Committee with David Kretzmer, an Israeli expert in international and constitutional law. Kretzmer served as a member of the UN Human Rights Committee, including a two-year term as its vice-chairperson.
The discussion with Kretzmer focused on the evolution of the UN Human Rights Committee since its establishment 40 years ago. Having personally served on the committee, Kretzmer offered distinctive lessons on how the committee’s role and perception by other actors such as nation states, NGOs and individuals— as well as its self-perception— have changed.
He began the discussion by emphasizing the historic background of the committee: The UN Human Rights Committee is a treaty body comprised of 18 renowned experts from across the world who meet three times a year for three to four week sessions to consider reports submitted by no less than 169 states on their compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The committee also considers any individual petitions concerning 116 states parties to the Optional Protocol. It is one of ten UN Human Rights bodies responsible for overseeing implementation of particular treaties.
Kretzmer emphasized the decade-long debate at the heart of the committee’s work regarding its actual role and scope of its mandate. For many years, the committee’s role was unclear, and its mandate to investigate states’ actions and commitments to the covenant’s ideals was undetermined, even overlooked, to avoid causing unrest among member states. With the committee established at the height of the Cold War in 1977, its work was further obstructed by members from the Soviet bloc. As the discussion at Columbia noted, the underlying message in the early days was that the committee should refrain from criticism of states and serve mainly as a means of constructive dialogue between committee members and representatives of states.

This meant the committee was a place of “friendly relations among nations,” Kretzmer told RightsViews. The committee was not allowed to use any information pertaining to human rights maintenance or violation other than the information submitted in states parties’ reports. In other words, so long as a country did not voluntarily report its own wrongdoings, the committee was largely toothless in examining, reprimanding or even recommending changes to its policies.
Furthermore, all decisions within the committee had to be decided by consensus, rather than by a vote. This reality was true for most of the first 23 years of the committee’s existence. Since the end of the Cold War, the unwritten rules that once limited the committee so heavily have changed in rapid fashion.
The committee began to shift from being a mere scene of “friendly relations” to becoming more informed, less limited and thus more able to actually monitor compliance with the Covenant under which it was established. It began receiving, for example, information regarding states’ behavior, mainly from NGOs— a phenomenon that became central to human rights advocacy in the 1990s onwards. Furthermore, political differences, while surely still felt, had changed: they weren’t Cold War-inspired and centric anymore. The committee could now finally arrive at concluding observations regarding a state’s compliance with the covenant.
The discussion also emphasized the differences between the committee and the better known, perhaps even controversial, Human Rights Council (which replaced the UN Commission on Human Rights in 2006). The later, a political rather than professional body, is a charter-based mechanism where states can debate human rights concerns. Kretzmer stressed the differences between the two bodies, their work and subsequent reputation during the discussion, emphasizing the need for better balance in the way the two bodies interact. Kretzmer hinted at some criticism of the council with regard to its failure to deny membership to nation states known for serial and consistent violations of human rights.
Before concluding, Kretzmer addressed further issues raised by members of the audience, such as the role of international and national courts and other legal institutions, the global effort at criminalizing aggression, and more. He stressed the importance of the human rights treaty bodies and treaty signatories while also acknowledging the gap between a nation’s willingness to declare its loyalty to human rights ideals and actual actions to advance human rights-based morality, legislation and enforcement.
In concluding, Kretzmer discussed the paradox of human rights monitoring: the countries with better human rights records are generally more open societies. Thus, there is a great deal of information available on their human rights violations. In contrast, the countries with the worst human rights regimes (North Korea, for example) are often closed societies, meaning there is an overall lack of information on their human rights practices. Thus, from the treaty bodies’ concluding observations it may sometimes appear that the more open and democratic societies suffer from more human rights violations than closed and non-democratic states.

The story of Spain’s traumatic history is compelling because it is continuously unfolding. One of my most memorable experiences in Barcelona this summer was my visit to an air raid shelter that was designed during the Spanish Civil War to protect thousands of civilians during the fascist bombings of Barcelona. The existence of the shelter was only discovered a couple of years ago by a cable company. The company intended to build an underground landline to connect more people throughout Spain, but the irony of the situation is that something much deeper connects the people of Spain: a traumatic memory that tells the story of a vicious divide within Spain, as well as within Europe, of those who risked their lives for progressive change and those who compromised their own morality.
In 2017, these casual rediscoveries of a traumatic Spanish past are triggering an outpouring of civilian, intellectual and political inquiry. The European Observatory for Memories (EUROM) addresses these so-called “black spots in history” that have resulted in a pact of silence and brought Spanish society to an inevitable tipping point. In essence, an avalanche of unaddressed and unvalidated memories has come falling down, and there is no time to methodically pick up the pieces. To complicate this mess further, we must be reminded that the hands picking up the pieces are more likely to belong to the descendants of those witnesses of the Spanish Civil War, and later, of the Franco regime.
How does the intergenerational nature of the situation influence perspectives of justice? In order to explore this question, it is necessary to dive into my personal perspective and attempt to explain the nature of my own psychological matrix as I woke up everyday and went to work at EUROM. Toward the middle of my spring 2017 semester, I became transfixed with a pending national lawsuit called Juliana v. The United States. In short, the case posits 20 youth plaintiffs against the government. The youths are fighting for a right to a stable climate society; they explicitly argue that the government has disproportionately disfavored younger generations by leaving them with a turbulent climate system. My fascination with the case pushed me to challenge my understanding of generational trauma and justice. Similar to climate change, generational justice cannot be achieved by pointing the finger. It is easy to say that someone is “responsible,” but at the same time, responsibility gets lost in translation as generations elapse.
EUROM and Juliana are similar in the sense that they attempt to reinvent societal consensus; just as Juliana pushes the justice system to reevaluate how crucial climate is to a stable society, EUROM pushes people to finally recognize the gruesome realities of the war and the traumatic impacts it had on collective societal consciousness. In this vein, both actors attempt to evolve a moral spectrum by tapping into a unique emotionality.
I was lucky enough to witness EUROM succeed in this mission; one of their most exciting recent developments includes the closure of a former men’s prison, La Model. The organization worked alongside the city government and other bilateral community organizations in a participatory process to close the prison, which served as one of Franco’s torture centers of innocent people during the Spanish Civil War. The process transformed the prison into a cultural and memorial space. The logic of this transformation is to recognize the significance of this space and to dismantle the tortuous and imprisoning aspect of it. Refashioning the space to facilitate activities that promote justice signifies to society that communities cannot only come to terms with the cruelty once committed in this space but also can positively address it.
But the impacts of the transformation go beyond mere symbols; the men once imprisoned in La Model are now emancipated and starting to integrate back into society. They have the opportunity to work during the day to earn money and then are required to return to government supervision at night. This experiment is called the “open prison model.” The model releases the men from the panopticon watch that the prison was designed to promote.
Projects like La Model exhibit how EUROM advocates that justice cannot be achieved when paired with amnesia. The process of remembering, recovering and retelling is central to the process of healing. Just because first-hand memories are gradually dissolving in numbers, it does not mean that younger generations facilitate civil society with a clean slate. I am returning to Columbia College reinvigorated by my experience at EUROM. I am approaching my studies with a strong belief that we inherit history, and as civilians, it is our duty to deal with and learn from it, passing this philosophy onto others when we leave earth.
This summer, Columbia College student Zina Precht-Rodriguez participated in an eight-week international internship program sponsored by Columbia University’s Institute for the Study of Human Rights (ISHR). Her research interests include climate policy and intergenerational justice. In this entry, she reflects on her time in Barcelona, Spain, at an ISHR affiliate organization, the European Observatory on Memories (EUROM), a “transnational network of institutions and organizations committed to the analysis and promotion of remembrance public policies.” The mission of EUROM is to “reflect on the recent history of the struggle for democracy and freedom in Spain and Europe, and to advocate for a plurality of memories.”
Individuals fortunate enough to have survived traumatic events are commonly referred to as “resilient.” In fact, a resilience framework/agenda has become part of commonly-accepted humanitarian and human rights language and programming. But what does this framework, which attempts to foster resiliency among trauma survivors, actually accomplish? This is the question I have spent the past year attempting to answer. My paper titled “Genealogy of Resilience: Women’s Resiliency to Conflict-Related Sexual Violence” was recently chosen as a winner of the 2017 Human Rights Essay Contest through the Institute for the Study of Human Rights.
The application of the term “resilient” to women who have experienced gender-based violence, either locally or globally, remains unclear. What is more evident is that linkages can be drawn between the usage of resilience theory and the popularization of describing women as “survivors.” Referring to women who have survived gender-based trauma as “resilient” pays homage to the extreme emotional and sometimes physical struggles involved in carrying on with one’s life following the worst imaginable circumstances. As such, the terms “survivor” and “resilient” commonly overlap, and at times, they may even be used interchangeably.
Yet, the “survivor” identity would not exist without the “victim” identity. If the “victim” is pathetic and undesirable, then the “survivor” is radiant, warrior-like, and maybe even “a little sexy.” New York Times literary critic Parul Sehgal references Lisbeth Salander from “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” as an example of a “survivor.” What woman would choose the “victim” identity over the “survivor” identity? It becomes almost compulsory for women to wear the “survivor” identity as a badge of honor and proof of their heroism. “Survivor” becomes the obligatory replacement for “victim.” Resilient women, then, may as well be forced into being just that.
Stephanie Euber, winner of the 2017 Human Rights Essay Contest through the Institute for the Study of Human Rights.
Recognizing women who have been traumatized as “resilient survivors” enables these women to occupy a space of strength rather than a space of stigmatization. It calls attention to the agency of women. Referring to women as “resilient” also sends a message to other women and girls who may someday endure such trauma and injury at the hands of men. It tells them something they may not be accustomed to hearing: “Yes, you can survive.”
At the same time, survivor discourse risks re-privatizing the societal problem of violence against women. The popular feminist slogan, “The personal is political,” derived from Carol Hanisch’s popularized paper from 1969, becomes reversed by survivor discourse, which makes the political personal once again. If those in power do not have to face the part they play in this oppression, they are able to avoid accountability.
Referring to women who have endured conflict-related rape as “resilient” personalizes survival in a way that moves the discussion of violence against women away from where it needs to be. Instead of calling attention to the problems of patriarchal violence and the very real effects it has on women and children, the resilience agenda applauds individual women for the personal characteristics that have enabled them to survive such horrors. It congratulates the “survivor” without criticizing the root cause of the violence that had to be survived. Patriarchal violence risks being normalized as something women must endure; it becomes a “fact of life.”
As human rights, international law, and conflict discourses move to highlight rape as a weapon of war, sexual violence as a war crime, and violence against women more generally as a serious human rights violation, it becomes clear that resilience is not the answer it was once imagined to be within the fields of psychology and psychiatry.
Largely, at least in the case of the non-Western, South Sudanese women whom I have studied closely, it is not the women themselves who tend to comment on their own resiliency. Instead, this terminology comes from the mouths of Western humanitarian workers, psychologists, and media sources. As such, it is logical to remain critical of this sort of discourse that refers to women, and especially non-Western women, as “resilient survivors.” Advocates and activists must find a way to ensure that theory and practice be informed by those who have experienced violence without allowing the burden of responsibility for social change to rest wholly on those who have been victimized.

As students across Columbia—both graduate and undergraduate—settle into the Spring term a series of questions echo around campus: What are your plans for the summer? Have you begun your dissertation? And, most dreaded of all: what’s next? It is this last question, of what comes after graduation, that seems to produce the most anxiety. This is especially true for students interested in fields characterized by less-than-clear paths to employment or uncertain job prospects. One such example is human rights, and so it was of great benefit to many that on February 26th the Institute for the Study of Human Rights held a career panel about what it means to pursue human rights as a profession. The event was comprised of a panel discussion with five human rights professionals followed by an open question and answer session.
The speakers were qualified, interesting, and informative. The panel consisted of: Antonio Cisneros de Alencar, Program Coordinator for the UN Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights in Guatemala; Rose Anderson, a Program Associate for Protection Services at Scholars at Risk and an HRSMA alumnus; Sheree Bennet, a Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science at Yale who is working for the International Rescue Committee; Zeke Johnson, the Managing Director of Amnesty International USA’s Individuals at Risk Program; and Amanda Klasing, a researcher in the women’s rights division of Human Rights Watch.
To this diverse group were put questions about the content of their work, the specific challenges it poses, their career paths, the skills and personal qualities it requires, and what they look for if hiring for their own position. We heard fascinating accounts of the complexity involved in the OHCHR’s work on the rights of indigenous peoples in Guatemala; how research and practice come together in the IRC project in Haiti; and what is involved in identifying and protecting scholars at risk. While it would have been useful to get a sense of a ‘day-in-the-life’ of each of these individuals, the accounts they provided of their work and that of their respective organizations did communicate the variety of experiences, directions, geographical locations, forms of advocacy and research, and professional positions available through a career in human rights.
Specific advice was also offered for those thinking about pursuing further education. When asked about the role of research in human rights practice and the value of embarking on further graduate work, Bennet cautioned that “being a great student is not a good enough reason to do a Ph.D.” It is important to remember, especially for current students, that the Ph.D. is about contributing to a body of knowledge and requires a “tenacity that is hard to imagine”. Similarly, Klasing spoke to the benefits and drawbacks of the MA and JD. While the JD gets the attention of those at the table—perhaps more so than the anthropologist in the room—the MA can provide one with the critical tools to approach human rights work with sensitivity and intellectual rigour. Ultimately, both pointed to the fact that certain kinds of graduate-level education are not for everyone, though most kinds can be valuable in some way to a career in human rights. At the end of the day, what is important is that you find the kind of contribution that is most closely aligned with your goals and interests. Along these lines Mr. Alencar insisted that students follow their passions and avoid framing themselves by what’s most demanded by the market, for at the end of the day human rights is about believing in a cause and working on something that drives you. Additionally, he pointed out that you can work on human rights issues from many different types of organizations, and that, in fact, limiting your career path to only one sector is often less effective than gaining experience by going from one sector to another.
The panel was mostly in agreement on the kinds of skills, experiences, and qualities necessary for many of their positions or the human rights profession in general: languages (at least 2, if interested in international work), applied research, writing and communication skills (distilling ideas in a way that resonates), being a team player, showing that one is serious and respectful but also friendly, strategic thinking (seeing all the moving parts of a process and knowing how to synthesize them), quick thinking, methodological training, problem solving and sound judgment, world experience (living abroad, experience with other cultures), and drive, to name the most frequently mentioned. How does one gain such skills and experience? This was less fully addressed. The panel did suggest the importance of networking, internships, putting the word out that you’re looking for a certain kind of work, having mentors (informal and formal), error-free applications, and to “be a star intern!”
While it is useful to be reminded of the value of these skills and the strategies for showcasing them, looking back it is clear that the list of skills, experiences, and qualities the panel assembled is not unique to the human rights field. Even if the embodiment of all these qualifications does make someone an exceptional candidate, these skills and experiences fall in line with similar lists that one could imagine for virtually every profession. So even as these individuals all offered unique perspectives and valuable advice, I felt that an audience feeling ever more pressured by an ever-increasingly corporatized and bureaucratized human rights field would be better served by a more creative or reflective approach to ‘careers in human rights’. What I would like to hear, then, from those in the thick of the profession is what (academic, intellectual, social, cultural, etc.) backgrounds and skills they feel are underrepresented in their field? What kinds of individuals have surprised them by their contribution to their shared work? When have unexpected convergences of perspectives, individuals, or groups lead to fruitful collaborations? When have existing structures proved inadequate to the tasks of effecting change and how might these moments of failure point to potential spaces for innovation? What are the mechanisms by which a human rights perspective might be creatively introduced to all sorts of spaces—governmental, educational, corporate, personal, recreational? What are the limits or weaknesses of their organizations?
These broader conversations about creative solutions to pressing problems would enhance the value of human rights education and further complement a full CV.

Human rights work can encompass a myriad of issues, projects, approaches and geographical locations. This wide range of opportunities can be exhilarating for human rights students; however, it can also be hard to find the right fit for students’ skills and passions. To address the possibilities and challenges of working in this field as well as provide students with guidance and advice, the Institute of Human Rights Studies at Columbia University hosted a panel discussion, “Careers in Human Rights,” on Monday, April 7, 2014.
The panel consisted of four professionals with a diverse range of experiences in human rights work: Sapna Chhatpar Considine, Program Director at the International Coalition for the Responsibility to Protect; Larry Cox, Co-Director of Kairos: the Center for Religions, Rights and Social Justice and former Executive Director of Amnesty International USA; Meg Gardinier, Director of Arigatou International-New York and Chair of the Campaign for U.S. Ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child; and Refik Hodzic, Director of Communications at the International Center for Transitional Justice. The panelists described their present work and projects, as well as their paths to their current positions. Their presentations were followed by a Q&A session.
A common theme that emerged in all of the presentations was the value of collaboration amongst their various lines of work. Gardinier noted that, on the one hand, NGOs offer more freedom and ways to focus on human-rights based work but the budget is often limited. On the other hand, larger institutions provide substantive resources and authority. However, well-funded inter-governmental organizations may offer fewer opportunities to directly contribute to rights-related projects. The answer, she said, lies in partnerships between these entities, as well as among civil society actors more generally. She also recommended that students consider the possibilities of collaboration with the private sector by exploring work in corporate social responsibility, for example.
Panelists also highlighted issues around obtaining funds for their work, and they agreed that fundraising can create undeniable tension because the process can be time-consuming and create competition with like-minded organizations. They noted pressures that are at times contradictory and make the process even more difficult to navigate, like the troubled economy coupled with the fact that there is more funding for human rights than ever before. Panelists underscored the need for creativity and “doing more with less,” and also exhorted students to work on gaining fundraising skills, an asset in the non-profit world.
The session ended with the question, “What is a specific skill, quality or qualification in the people you look to hire that these students can try to further develop?” The panelists’ answers included: strong writing skills, up-to-date knowledge of social media tools, solid interpersonal skills, knowledge of the particular issue being addressed, network-building capabilities, humility and the ability to listen. Cox advised: “Be self-critical and try to get rid of your ego, you don’t have to be the best and the brightest. Social justice is about another society, different values…if all you want to do is take the values we have now and bring them into social justice, you’re just going to be part of the problem.”
Despite the diversity of the panelists’ experiences and areas of expertise, they all communicated the value of staying true to one’s principles while inevitably having to engage in frustrating corporate dynamics. They urged students to maintain their sense of integrity and hope in the face of obstacles. For example, despite having quit his previous job twice over a sense of disillusionment with his former institution, Hodzic now finds himself in a rewarding role, advocating for human rights through communications methods: “I’m proud to count myself among the people who are trying to develop the thinking about how the fields of journalism and activism are merging, and to practice that theory in a way.” Considine mentioned the difficulty of watching the Syria crisis unfold, but went on to describe how much she appreciates being able to travel the world and talk to civil society members about the Responsibility to Protect. Gardinier described how the US Campaign to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child has been a long process, but that it’s deeply significant to her and her colleagues, saying: “It’s slow but important work.”
All of the panelists echoed the sense of having an innate pull towards human rights work that sustains them. Considine noted her dedication to her profession, even when it can feel impractical: “As I get older, it can feel harder to justify the pay I get and the hours I spend, but I’m one hundred percent committed to this work, which is why I’ve stayed in it.” Cox added, “You have to decide not only what you want to do, but what is your vision of doing human rights work? A well-paying job? Or does it mean something else? My advice is, if you really want to be in the future of human rights, try to go find those organizations on the ground, the Dreamers movement, the Gay Rights movement, go work with them for a while, take advantage of the fact that maybe you don’t have twelve kids yet. Go listen to them, and learn from them.” Hodzic noted, “I think this work chooses you, rather than the other way around. You have to be a certain kind of person, a certain kind of professional to do this work. I don’t think you could just ‘make it’ a career like you do in the corporate world.”
Many human rights students attended this event, including several from various other programs at Columbia. Numerous students stayed afterwards to talk to the speakers individually. This panel was useful in providing an honest, open forum for dialogue about the challenges and rewards of this line of work. The panelists’ anecdotes and straightforward advice gave students a sense of where their own interests might lead and which skills to cultivate. Through the stories of their own professional trajectories, the panelists encouraged students to pursue what they find meaningful and to sustain their vision of what a more just world will look like.

Penelopa Gjurchilova, a former Macedonian diplomat and visiting scholar at the Institute for the Study of Human Rights (ISHR) quoted this popular Macedonian proverb during her opening remarks at a symposium entitled “Foreign Policy Makeover: Women’s Roles and Rights in Diplomacy,” held on November 14, 2013 at Columbia University.
ISHR and the Gender and Public Policy Specialization at the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) hosted this symposium, consisting of two panels of former and current ambassadors and foreign policy professionals from around the world. The panelists discussed personal experiences within the field of diplomacy and shared their professional perspectives on the issue of including women’s rights in diplomatic affairs. Chaired by Yasmine Ergas, Associate Director of ISHR and Director of the Gender and Public Policy Specialization at SIPA, the symposium created a unique opportunity for women and men to be heard on the role of gender and women’s rights in foreign policy.
From left, Yasmine Ergas, Ambassador Rosemary DiCarlo, Ambassador John Hirsch, Ambassador Karen Tan, and Ambassador Greta Gunnarsdotir engage in a panel discussion with Columbia students and faculty.
Penelopa Gjurchilova began the symposium with a call to younger generations to be guided by principles of equity and equality, which other panelists echoed in their discussions. She pointed out that although the status of women in diplomacy is improving, many countries have not seen progress on this issue, which is not only a matter of human rights but is essential in maintaining peaceful international relations and equality worldwide.
The distinguished speakers spoke about how women in diplomacy tend to face particularly difficult challenges, not least among which include existing stereotypes regarding traditional women’s roles and the always-in-conflict tug of war between family life and career. There are, however, ways for women to improve their experiences in the diplomatic corps. Women must communicate with each other, exchange ideas, and form networks within which they can help each other as they enter and rise through the diplomatic ranks. As more women achieve higher-level diplomatic positions, stereotypes break down and access to more prestigious positions increases. Women in diplomacy in the past, and even now, are the pioneers, and despite the difficulty of that position, it is their responsibility to make that workforce easier for women in the future.
Also voiced throughout the panel discussions was the conviction that the engagement of women in diplomacy absolutely does not mean the disengagement of men. Gender equality is especially necessary for peace processes, or lasting peace will be impossible to achieve. Creating opportunities for women in diplomacy and post-conflict processes will take a considerable amount of work, and mostly from women. For example, the United Nations Women branch was established only when a group of female ambassadors got together, lobbied for its existence, and put massive effort into its creation. Another example of proactive women came from Ambassador John Hirsch, who explained that women played an immense role in ending a junta rule in Sierra Leone and in instituting elections. They became role models for other nations, and we must remember that women are integral to the processes of peace and reconciliation.
Another crucial point, which became a topic of discussion in the second panel, was the lack of governments’ political commitment to putting gender issues on their agendas. While an awareness of gender issues in governments is important, there also must be the political will to do something about them, without which nothing can truly be accomplished. In order to achieve change, governments must budget for gender issues and ensure that the structures in place promote equality. The individual is very important, but if the correct structures are not in place, there is only so far women can go. Leadership is terribly important as well, as H.E. Mrs. Tine Mørch Smith, Deputy Permanent Representative of Norway to the UN, highlighted. A whole generation of girls in Norway was empowered by the female Prime Minister at the time, and this played an immense role in the ambassador’s aspirations to begin a career in diplomacy as well as her access to higher-level positions.
Carne Ross, Executive Director of Independent Diplomat, presented a powerful opinion on the issue of gender itself. Of utmost importance is “de-gendering.” As long as diplomacy remains infused with a male-dominated environment, made up of zero sum negotiations, heavy drinking, long hours, and other traditionally male workplace characterizations, it will be challenging for women to rise in the ranks. Hiring more women, though it sounds like a solution, cannot alone address the problem. A systematic analysis into the political and institutional structures needs to take place. Diplomacy, he confidently stated, is a gendered archetype in itself. Win-lose modeling takes precedence over a consensus-seeking model, hard issues are valued over “soft” issues, empiricism is valued over emotion, and there is a priority to security over all else. Complete with a historical notion of hierarchy, the diplomatic corps is male-oriented, as are states. Therefore, global issues will not be solved by states at all, but rather, by a mass movement of men and women who are not bound within a hierarchical system.
Mr. Ross’s bold views on de-gendering were appreciated; it was also pointed out that we must talk about the differentiation of experiences between men and women, maintaining two perspectives but being careful not to recreate gender dichotomies. We must, Ms. Ergas mentioned, move beyond the question of gender and find the next step.
The symposium raised a lot of important issues, shining a light on gender inequality in diplomacy and opening the door for further discussion and analysis of gender questions. This symposium has set the stage, and now we must work together to find, analyze, and take that next step so that we, eventually, do not have to talk about gender at all.

On September 17th, The Institute for the Study of Human Rights (ISHR) hosted their annual Fall Reception where human rights advocates, scholars, and students gathered to welcome the new school year. Hosted on the top floor of Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA), the backdrop of the New York City skyline was a befitting scene for the diverse crowd of current and future human rights practitioners. The attendees included incoming and returning human rights students and professors from across Columbia, as well as scholars and fellows at the ISHR.
The reception was a great way to meet students, professors, human rights advocates and fellows. Hedayt Selim, a first-year student from Cairo in the Master of Arts in Human Rights Studies program, was among many of the guests attending the ISHR Fall Reception. “It’s a great opportunity to branch out and meet professors and fellow students that you wouldn’t otherwise meet.” Selim, like many other first-year students, ws drawn to Columbia’s human rights program for many reasons. “What I liked about this program was its interdisciplinary character and I think New York is a great place to be studying human rights.”
Yasmine Ergas, the Associate Director of the ISHR, and the Director for Gender and Human Rights addressed the crowd with a warm welcome and introduced a group of human rights leaders participating in the Human Rights Advocates program. Elazar Barkan, the Director of the ISHR, and Professor of International and Public Affairs at SIPA, introduced this year’s participating fellows in the Alliance for Historical Dialogue and Accountability program. Then the advocates and fellows each introduced themselves and spoke about the work they do in their respective countries. Coming from countries around the world, the advocates and fellows represent a diverse group with a collective common goal to raise awareness of human rights issues affecting their countries in order to push for peace and justice.
Geoffrey Mayamba, an advocate from Zambia participating in the Human Rights Advocates program, represented Prisoners Future Foundation which is an organization he founded that aims to improve the welfare of current and former prisoners in Zambia. “Our vision is to see a society in which the rights and other needs of prisoners and ex-prisoners are understood, respected and upheld.” Prisoners Future Foundation has been running for five years but has only been funded for two. Mayamba, having been a prisoner in his home of Zambia for over 10 years, was inspired to create the organization based on his own experiences. “Having seen the sufferings that prisoners are subjected to, I felt I could form an organization to address these issues and be a voice for the voiceless.” Some of the main priorities of the organization include working with the Zambian government in an effort to establish ways to decongest the prisons, provide access to adequate health care in the facilities, and find ways to improve prisoners’ access to justice. Mayamba’s organization also works with the Minister of Justice to develop judicial reform policy.
Another advocate who discussed his work that evening was Biel Boutros Biel from South Sudan. Biel is the Executive Director of the South Sudan Human Rights Society for Advocacy (SSHURSA). “I’m learning a lot in the program and it is helping me do far better in my work in South Sudan.” Part of the work he does is inform people on human rights issues, as well as working to educate women, youth, local government officials and local authorities on human rights.
Serhat Rasul Cacan, one of the Alliance for Historical Dialogue and Accountability fellows introduced at the event, is a historian from Turkey that specializes in oral history. As part of his work and research in oral history, he works on projects that analyze narratives and life stories of Turkish people. Cacan focuses mainly on Kurdish narratives, and analyzes how Kurdish people have memorized events in the past. “There is a motto ‘we cannot change the history, but we can change our memory about the history.’” During his time at Columbia, Cacan plans to create a project which incorporates historical dialogue within Turkish and Armenian communities.
Isaiah Chabala, a former ambassador of Zambia to the United Nations and the European Union, was also among the distinguished, global leaders and advocates. After his career as an ambassador, Chabala became president and founder of a non-profit called Visionary Empowerment who’s mission is “to empower women and girls of under-served communities in Zambia, and to teach them how to sustain and enable themselves.” This in turn helps to combat poverty, gender inequality, and vulnerability. Visionary Empowerment was founded in 2005, and has successfully trained more than 600 women and girls by providing skills and vocational training.
The work of the ISHR’s advocates and fellows, as well as human rights students under the guidance of accomplished and enthusiastic professors was greatly recognized at the Fall Reception. The room was full of human rights actors and was an inspiring way to set the tone for the academic year.

The Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade had the honor on November, 8th 2010 to host Prof. Sir Arnold Wolfendale, FRS, 14th Astronomer Royal. Prof. Wolfendale visited the Observatory and was shown the Great refractor by Dr. Ištvan Vince, deputy director of AOB and head of WP2 of the BELISSIMA project, Dr. Srdjan Samurović, coordinator of the BELISSIMA project and Dr. Oliver Vince, member of the staff of the Observatory. Prof. Wolfendale spoke with the staff of the Observatory and the BELISSIMA project was described to him. In the conversation with Prof. Wolfendale the possibilities of collaboration with the astronomers from the United Kingdom were discussed as well as numerous problems of contemporary astronomy and science (cosmic rays, observations of the Sun, observations of binary stars, dynamics of galaxies, climate changes, astrobiology).
I am a very flirtatious person who can blow your mind once by showing my abilities to cum every lust that a you contain.
Little is known about the life of painter George Seraut. Barely a cipher in the impressionist movement, Seraut experimented in obscurity and died at 31, never having sold one of his works. It wasn't until much later that Seraut's dynamic pointillist (or "chromo-luminist") representations of color and light were regarded as masterpieces.
The Pulitzer-prize winning musical Sunday in the Park with George  a live performance of which this disc is a television recording  is not as much an attempt to interpret Seraut's life through what he clues he may have left in his art, but instead uses this imagined life to comment on the nature of artists and art, and the uneasy yet emotionally vital relationship between art and life.
The first act of Sunday is concerned with Seraut's creation of his greatest work, the gigantic "A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte." While George (Mandy Patinkin) sketches (and enacts) the goings-on of this Parisian island, his curious presence is met with amusement and scorn by the working- and upper-class Sunday strollers. There is also tension between George and his model/lover Dot (Bernadette Peters). His attention toward her is spent obsessively recreating her on sketchpad and canvas  hardly the emotional contact she craves. Eventually she leaves him, for a more attentive baker, and moves to America with George's newborn child. George delves further into his misunderstood, maverick style.
The second act flashes forward to the 1980s, where George's great grandson (also Patinkin, and also named George) is also an artist, struggling to balance his technology-heavy, stagnant art with the commercial and social demands of a booming capitalist art market. With the help of his ailing grandmother Marie (also Peters)  Dot's daughter  George is able to reconnect with his past and focus on creating something new.
Sunday flourishes in Sondheim's rich lyrics and compositions. Single-handedly responsible for maturing American musical theater since the early 1970s, Sondheim turns in here one of his most courageous and introspective works. His music mimics Seraut's style, percussive and punctuating, a smattering of notes evolving into soaring melodies.
Lyrically, Sondheim portrays George as an obsessive genius incapable of sharing the emotion of his work with the people closest to him  not very different from how Sondheim himself is often portrayed. The result is brilliant, and often heartbreaking. George's obsession with the technique of his art is vividly portrayed in the song "Color and Light," and the chasm of understanding between George and Dot is heart-wrenching in "We Do Not Belong Together." The show's most moving numbers, "Finishing the Hat" and "Beautiful," lovingly examine the joy, meaning, and desperation of art; from its ability to capture the rarest of moments, to the wonder of creating something as simple and mundane as a hat.
As for Patinkin and Peters, they have the best voices in the business, and this 1984 recording captures them in their prime. Patinkin gamely commits to all of George's eccentricities, feverishly dabbing at his canvas in one scene, and in the next imagining a duet between dogs in the park. His presence is solid, his voice is rich, and the complexity of his performance proves him the master performer he is.
Where most Sondheim shows suffer, however, are in the spoken dialog, written here by Sunday's director and frequent Sondheim collaborator James Lapine. Though obviously intelligent, Lapine too often stoops for easy, gimmicky laughs, forsaking the material's subtlety and pacing. While Lapine must be credited with the marvelous way he gradually assembles a stage tableau of Seraut's "La Grande Jatte" out of the set and characters, much of the non-musical build up to this magical Act One finale is a tad grating. Sadly, as great as it is to see this historic production, Lapine's shortcomings as a self-editor make the Original Cast Recording CD the best way to enjoy this incredible combination of Sondheim's, Patinkin's, and Peters' talents.
The image on this disc is adequate (it was originally shot on broadcast video) and is presented in standard 1.33:1. The first act suffers from a few too many shimmers, artifacts, and image freezes (even dropping a line of dialog in one scene). The 2.0 Dolby sound on the disc is a great improvement over its VHS counterpart, and makes this live recording sound as crisp and clear as possible. Also included are production notes and an indispensable commentary track with Sondheim, Patinkin, Peters, and Lapine. Overall, this disc is great for Sondheim fans, but it doesn't touch the pristine experience of the sublime Cast Recording.
Commentary track by Steven Sondheim, Mandy Patinkin, Bernadette Peters, and James Lapine; textual supplements

Dale Hawkins was an innovator and an original Chess recording artist who had played his music in his own unique style since the mid 50's. This CD is a compilation of rare songs from the 50's and early 60's and new recordings from the 80's & 90's. This was the first release on Beveric Records and Dale Hawkins was truly back in business.
A great selection of remastered early recordings, including Dale's ultra rare Zonk single from 1961 and some brand new rockers. The CD kicks off with a legendary track penned by Dave Alvin, James Burton & Dale Hawkins join their forces on "Fool's Paradise". An unbeatable combination! This is the real thing!
The copyrights in these sound recordings are owned by Plumtone Music Inc. and are licensed to Beveric Ltd.
On this album Dale Hawkins was backed up by some of the best musicians - The legendary Crickets and Dale join forces on "Well.. All Right". James Burton and Dale Hawkins are back in studio together for the first time since late 60's. Several of the sessions had other well known musicians like Joe Osborne, Larry Knechtel (Duane Eddy's band), Kenny Brown (sideman to R.L. Burnside).
Special mention goes to Pekka Laine (Hypnomen) and Mika Liikari (Barnshakers) who had a chance to play with Dale while he was in Finland. The guys overdubbed the guitar & upright bass to Wildcat Tamer in Helsinki and the result is outstanding.
The Zonk release of Peaches/Gotta Dance is very rare and chances of finding original copies are slim. Beveric Records reissued this sought-after rocker as a bonus along with the new songs.
Unwilling to pretend that colorism doesn’t play a part in the way black women are treated in their day to day lives?
Rising to fame as the brains behind Destiny’s Child, Knowles’ once heavily guarded private life now finds itself up for public discussion now that the revered industry power player has revealed how internalised racism caused him to pursue Beyonce‘s mother.
For, he also revealed why it’s time for all of us to listen to African-American artists who believe that their inability (or unwillingness) to lighten their hair and skin has blocked their path to levels reached by Nicki Minaj, Rihanna and Beyonce herself.
When I was growing up, my mother used to say, ‘Don’t ever bring no nappy-head black girl to my house.’”
In the deep South in the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s, the shade of your blackness was considered important. So I, unfortunately grew up hearing that message.
He then went onto reveal that he faced the same self-hatred when he joined the historically black campus Fisk.
They had a colourism issue there.I was in the last class where they’d take out a brown paper bag and if you were darker than the bag, you could not get into Fisk. One day I had a breakthrough. I used to date mainly white women or very high-complexion black women that looked white… I had been conditioned from childhood. Within eroticised rage, there was actual rage in me as a black man, and I saw the white female as a way, subconsciously, of getting even or getting back.
I actually thought when I met Tina that she was white. Later, I found out that she wasn’t, and she was actually very much in-tune with her blackness.
When it comes to black females, who are the people who get their music played on pop radio? Mariah Carey, Rihanna, the female rapper Nicki Minaj, my kids, and what do they all have in common?
August Alsina made a triumphant return to London at a packed-to-capacity indigO2 show presented by Musicalize.
It’s been two years since the R&B star hit the capital. And while for most acts said window represents a standard bridge between projects, his was the result of a much more serious reality. For, the New Orleans native has publicly battled a number of life threatening health challenges.
Donning a suave red suit (of which little was left by the night’s end), the 25-year-old commanded the crowd with spell-binding precision. And it didn’t require a plethora of production bells and whistles.
Effectively comprised of a mic, a DJ, and two Duracell-powered dancers (who delivered all evening), Alsina’s set placed the focus on his most prized assets: his catalogue and the vehicle that powers it – his voice.
Oft underrated as a vocalist, the singer gifted himself and fans many a moment showcasing the length and breadth of his impressive range. Indeed, performances of jams such as ‘Make It Home,’ ‘I Luv This,’ and ‘Downtown’ were punctuated with adlibs, runs, and outright belts that were evocative of a time when singers really…sang. Ah, the nostalgia.
Naturally, Alsina did indulge the obligatory “R&B pin-up” schtick. Case in point, a topless wipe-down to rapturous applause. But most praise-worthy is his holistic improvement as a performer.
Confident and comfortable, the star organically locked in (and out) of synchronised choreography with his dancers and worked all corners of the stage. He gave a…show; which is a marked improvement from earlier outings.
Despite a spell out of the spotlight, Alsina continues to prove himself to be a compelling artist. One with ample live gravitas. And with new music en route, he clearly has a talent and fanbase that’ll serve him well.
Lil Kim and R. Kelly dominated the Urban landscape in the 90s and are aiming to do so together in 2018.
Taking to social media, rap’s Queen Bee revealed that she and the Pied Piper had hit the studio together for a “legendary” collaboration. She told fans:
Word on the curb is that Kim is hard at work on her long-awaited fifth studio album – the follow-up to 2005’s ‘The Naked Truth.’
Iggy Azalea has used her platform to cape for a number of causes – including Kesha‘s fight against Dr. Luke who the latter accused of sexual harassment and more.
However, in an odd twist, some are alleging that the femcee’s comeback single ‘Savior’ is ironically produced by… Dr. Luke.
With the Quavo assisted song due out tomorrow, it’s already available in regions such as Australia – as such is playable on streaming services.
Indeed, for well over 30 years, the drinks giant have tapped some of the biggest names in Pop to create a fizz of excitement surrounding their beloved beverage.
And as this year’s Super Bowl sponsor, Pepsi celebrate their star-studded past with the Pepsi Generations commercial.
Set to air during the big game this Sunday, the spot – titled ‘This Is The Pepsi’- salutes King Of Pop Michael Jackson and Pop princess Britney Spears.
As streaming continues to anchor itself as the primary means of music consumption, more pressure than ever is being placed on artists to deliver big numbers on-demand.
Indeed, whereas streams of music video and audio used to serve as an additive measure to the more dominant digital downloads, the roles have reversed.
This has caused for the birth and boom of artists whose success is fuelled primarily by streaming such as Migos, Cardi B, and Lil Uzi Vert. It’s also helped boost acts whose traditional sales aren’t quite blockbuster ala Rihanna. There’s evidence too to suggest that it could very well have been a catalyst for established winners such Beyonce pivoting towards visual-driven roll-outs.
See, part and parcel of the streaming push is the rise and prominence of VEVO, whose “machine” like size and reach have allowed them to help build huge followings for the acts who use their platform. These artists have typically been signed to labels of VEVO partners such as Sony Music, Universal Music, and select indie entities.
This, in effect, has made it quite difficult for many acts not in said equation to compete. For, they’re left to use “normal” YouTube channels (often relegated to drive behind the scenes clips and the like) to push their actual music videos. The end result being lower views than their VEVO counterparts. This has especially been the case for indie talent as well Warner/Atlantic acts – with the few exceptions of the latter being Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, and Jason Derulo.
It’s also put acts who’ve, for example left Sony for Warner, in an odd position. Because in jumping ship, they give up use of their VEVO (and the millions of subscribers accrued) to begin dropping audio and video on their standard YouTube channels. Most of which are often much less populous.
Head below for more on the exciting move, which is set to benefit the likes of Ciara and Rita Ora, as well as veterans like Janet Jackson, in a significant way…
Set for roll-out in the coming weeks, the move will see ONE primary destination created for each artist. In effect, all of an artist’s channels – including their VEVOs – will be consolidated into one all-encompassing destination.
With the change, subscribers will receive notifications for all content officially uploaded by an artist anywhere on the YouTube platform – whether that be VEVO or their standard YouTube channel.
While this is a huge development for hundreds of artists, it has sizeable benefits for some of TGJ‘s top names.
Ciara and Rita Ora are two acts who made the move from their Sony Music labels to Warner last year. In doing so, they effectively left behind the millions of subscribers earned on their VEVO channels. CiCi has yet to release, but Rita has and, despite managing to still notch up hits, the disparity between views on her current artist channel and her VEVO are undeniable (i.e 10s of millions vs 100s of millions). With this new system, she’ll now be able to benefit from the reach she built on her previous label/platform. Same with Ci.
Elsewhere there are legends such as Janet Jackson who’ve made the move from the major label system to running her own indie imprint. The end result has seen her YouTube presence become super scattered: some videos on VEVO, others on her personal page, and countless more uploaded by fans. By uniting everything into one official spot, the confusion is somewhat remedied.
The news comes after Warner Music inked a deal with VEVO recently to begin sharing their content on the powerful platform. It also arrives following YouTube’s hiring of respected industry juggernaut Lyor Cohen as its Global Head Of Music.
Put simply, this levels out the playing field for artists and allows them to capitalize on their established brand, catalogue, and followings towards the benefit of their current outleti. For fans, they’ll be able to stay in the loops regardless of whatever label changes happen “behind the scenes.”
As we reported here, ‘Work From Home’ hitmakers Fifth Harmony are all set to go to work…work…work…on the ‘Lip Sync Battle’ stage with four sizzling solo performances.
With Lauren assuming the getup of Amy Winehouse, Ally becoming fly girl Jennifer Lopez, and Dinah dazzling as a character from Disney flick ‘Moana,’ arguably the most highly anticipated of the foursome’s performances will be that of Normani bouncing as Beyonce to the beat of Destiny’s Child‘s 2001 chart-topper, ‘Bootylicious.’
Busta Rhymes is on the comeback trail and has enlisted both Kelly Rowland and Missy Elliott to assist him.
The veteran rapper will be unleashing a new collaboration with the ladies and fans won’t have to wait long to hear it. Because, it’s coming on Friday (February 2nd).
And it seems Busta is making the necessary moves to make sure it moves the needle upon its release. Today he stopped by the Spotify office:
The ‘4:44’ mogul secured the rights to the name Hovino for the purposes of “restaurant and café services, pubs, cocktail lounges and wine bars” hours ago giving fans good reason to believe he is planning to open a restaurant.
If this is the case, his new venture would follow in the footsteps of his successful ’40/40′ club and the winning streak he has enjoyed a music mogul.
Lady GaGa surprised fans by joining her family to open the restaurant ‘Joanne‘s in her hometown of New York shortly after rising to fame.
Elsewhere, Justin Timberlake feeds the good people of the city at ‘Southern Hospitality‘ while the former sportsman Michael Jordan makes a pretty profit from ‘Michael Jordan’s Steakhouse.’
Sales-oriented candidates are typically assessed for their general numerical and verbal capabilities, such as their ability to price a deal or quickly calculate discounts, and their capacity to express themselves and shape and adapt their proposals to gain customer buy-in.
Assessment of candidates’ work style and sales attitude provides insight into likely behaviour across each step of the sales cycle (i.e., prospecting, building rapport, discovering needs, presenting solutions, overcoming objections, closing the sale, and servicing clients).

Jordan Green of Flower Mound High School in Texas might just have the best high school dunk ever. Green is headed to Texas A&M to play college basketball, so expect more spectacular dunks out of the kid.
The view from this side is better. A rarefied air talking of memories that belong to no one. One car drove the lane up to the border and everyone got out. A boy and girl child stood tip-toed to see over the wooden fence into the stained glass fields iridescent in perpetual sun. Here it existed with absent father mother in a band of monochrome; the lives of other people so fascinating.
Colours swam in and around objects too numerous to list. Focus on one and it disappeared into another. Hopes and achievements skipped gaily through the spectral meadows but were tripped so callously by fears and tainted thought.
Father mother sat disinterested on the border of dark and light in order to play cards. Here the lane was bisected, two equal halves stretched out all around and meeting once again.
Now the boygirl suffered much anxiety as great grey monoliths came crashing onto the field patterns. An imposing court of carved opportunities (missed and taken) spread out in a circle.
The boygirl felt the eyes of all the quarrelling heads and some innate urge pulled from within. Here with trepidation steps on the delicate ground; a walk to the centre.
when you do the 'pre' thing with longer lines of text, it stretches them way off the page............................so when you publish it, it comes out odd. Not necessarily a good thing all the time, but when I published this, I felt it went with the themes/mood of the piece. It 'worked' for this one, shall we say.
Just a little thing I wrote a while ago. I drew the childish picture too. It was the title, but I added the 'existence..' as that was were the whole thing stemmed from as a note in my notebook.
some of this can be see on some computers as a disjointed screaming madness. Fragmentation all up along the forearms. Some stretch it out to oblivion, like the infinity separation mentioned. You may not have it all. It works on a mac. This is what I know. It is not terribly important. In fact, I am happy about this. It goes with theme.

When there are multiple affiliates involved in one transaction, payment gets much more complicated. Sometimes it’s even possible for affiliates to jump in at the last minute and claim commissions for customers brought in by other affiliates. Successful programs use multi-channel attribution to ensure the affiliates that create the most value get paid the most.
Once you have this down, you’ll be a budding Etsy entrepreneur. Provide great quality to your customers, and they’ll often return. Many people are willing to pay a premium for quality handmade designs. Etsy (like EBay and Amazon) takes a cut off the top for selling items through their site. PayPal takes another cut, and you have to be careful with taxes on all income, so be diligent while building your online business.
Speaking of the benefits of permanent ads, banners and links aren’t the only ways to earn a little bit of dough off your online endeavors. By having a website, you gain the power of emailing companies to ask them for things. I have no shame in letting the yoga company whose mat I’m looking into purchasing know that I have a blog and write for yoga publications – it sometimes gets me discounts.
Don’t forget about FTC regulations! The government agency has begun cracking down on brands that don’t enforce disclosure of an incentive-driven relationship between the advertiser and the publisher. This applies to both influencers and affiliates, and in the past it has been fairly common for neither group to disclose the proper information. However, influencers seem to be even less aware of the rules than affiliates. In these situations, the advertiser, not the influencer or affiliate, incurs the wrath of the FTC in the form of penalties, fines and bad press. One need only look at the Lord & Taylor fiasco from last year to see that this can indeed be a serious issue. The FTC charged that the brand “deceived consumers by paying for native advertisements … and Instagram pictures.”

Commission Junction — This site serves as a clearinghouse for thousands of companies and small businesses looking to get into the affiliate business. It offers myriad affiliate programs, but you must apply separately to each one. Payout rates vary wildly, up to 50 percent, and some commissions are based on leads or clicks vs. sales. Frustratingly, Commission Junction deducts $10 from your accrued earnings for every month in which you don’t actively earn commissions; if you let your account lapse, your income could get wiped out.
If you can find and restore items like furniture and appliances, you can make a substantial amount of money. You can acquire the items on Craigslist, or even at garage sales or estate sales, restore them, and then list them for sale on the site. You may also be able to market certain items on eBay, particularly if they are small, unusual, but high in price.
LinkShare — Like Commission Junction, LinkShare provides access to affiliate-marketing opportunities from a variety of companies, including Buy.com. LinkShare’s site features an easy-to-read publisher dashboard that keeps you apprised of the latest offers from your merchant partners and gives you real-time access to your earning data.

Test websites. Remote usability testing means getting paid to navigate a website for the first time and giving feedback to the website owner. Most tests take approximately 15 minutes, and you can get paid up to $10 for each test. A test involves performing a scenario on the client’s website and recording yourself doing it. For example, you might be asked to go through the process of selecting and purchasing an item on a retailer’s website.[1]
Later on, I managed to earn more money from Walmart.com as an affiliate and joined commission junction and other affiliate networks to earn more money in affiliate marketing. the one part I really find challenging is creating rich content for my site every day or every other day. This is when I focus on other things such as YouTube video marketing, writing periodicals online, and so on. But nevertheless, joining a multiple affiliate networks is good for anyone to do because you want to create diversify sources of income. Just be mindful that when you join multiple affiliate networks you’re not only keeping in touch regularly with the affiliate managers you partner with through those specific affiliate programs, assure also asking them questions often about how to create effective affiliate landing pages,, informative YouTube videos with your affiliate link in them, as well as asking your affiliate manager to offer any other kind of promotional tactics you can use to increase your affiliate commission potential. I am sick and tired of hearing some people say they never earn one dime in affiliate marketing. That’s absolutely nonsense because they’re lazy and don’t bother to do the extra work. If you’re building relationships with your target audience and affiliate managers, creating content for your site and engaging YouTube videos daily or every other day, and staying active with other marketers in the affiliate marketing community, there’s no reason for you to fail.. Simple as that!

Whether you’re selling your own products, designs, or curating other products for people in your niche, Shopify is the best option for powering your online store.
You may decide to create free videos as extra content for your blog, and not sell them at all. If this is the case then you can still make money from these videos by selling advertising space on them (in the same way as discussed for monetizing podcasts). Once you have high volumes of traffic visiting your blog, and watching your videos, you can charge businesses to advertise at the beginning of your videos. Use website’s like Izea to help you connect with companies willing to pay to advertise on your blog.
Another one of the highest paying and most popular dating affiliate programs is eHarmony, which is based on the actual earnings that can be made from each referred sale. Up to $188 can be made from a single sale. In general, the members at eHarmony are typically looking to find serious long term relationships, so many of them are willing to pay extra to find similar people.

21. Facebook – Facebook swap shops are great for selling things locally. It’s like CraigsList, but a little easier. You simply search for swap shops in your area and ask to join the group. Once you’re in, take a picture of the item, write a quick description with the price and post it. It doesn’t get much easier than that. You can generally expect to get about what you would get at a yard sale, maybe a little more.
However, people can still do webinars without all of that. For example, you might have a sizable social media following and you train them every week on something to do with social media. But you will need a product to embed and sell at some point. Don't worry about it in the beginning. And by far, the best webinar platform out there is certainly GoToWebinar. Hands down, there isn't even another platform that comes close.

To grow as a leader and as a church there are three things that must be in a place that can be evaluated and corrected on a regular basis.
Some would call these our core values. These are the things that make us tick. That tell us who we are. These are the things that all the other “stuff” flow from. The priorities are the filter for every program, every dollar, and every effort. Without knowing our priorities and without evaluating them regularly and deciding if what we’re doing goes along with them, we’re running a a race without a course. Stop. Think. Prioritize.
No matter what you’re leading or doing, it comes down to the question… are you getting it done? It’s not just managing a to-do list or checking off some boxes, but it’s about measuring our production against our goals. What kinds of things are you keeping score on or counting that you can evaluate to see if you’re really producing. If you’re a leader in a church, this is what it’s about because it determines if people are meeting Jesus. The bottom line of any organization depends on this. Stop. Measure. Produce.
All that production should lead to progress. The bottom line is that we should be growing and healthy. Churches should be reproducing on every level. Progress means our cities and towns are changed because our church is there. Stop. Evaluate. Progress.
Help I am a leader at my church. We are going through some serious changes. I need a mentor to bounce ideas off and gain insight. I need someone unbiased. I have a presentation in 1 week to other leaders. Would you help me please!

Marsha Norman’s TCG playwriting workshop, “Secrets of the Great Play,” was attended by nearly 100 participants this afternoon, including eminent playwrights Philip Kan Gotanda and Deborah Laufer. Here’s Norman (night, Mother) on:
Story: “The audience only cares about stories that ask questions they are wondering about right now. You don’t ask directions to a place you don’t want to go. And the questions are always: How do we get through? What are our struggles as human beings on the earth?”
The cooked and the raw: “A great play has both something you understand deeply and something you find shocking and perverse.”
Dramatic conflict: “We can’t be without the battle. That’s the hard-wiring. Humans are heart-filled beings who want to go out and do battle to protect their families. That’s why video games are so popular — they let us relive the experience of being engaged in the battle on our own behalf.”
Why Romeo & Juliet should really be called just Juliet: “The main character is the one with the most to lose. Romeo & Juliet is really about Juliet. Face it—Romeo was going to die anyway. But Juliet could’ve married a nice man and been happy.”

Had a friend who is an I.T. guy build me a new one in a case about the size of a book that sits on top of my desk. All new SSD hard drives etc, truly amazing to have a new better than my old computer in such a tiny case.
SSD hard drives are the future,basically memory cards with no moving parts. Best part to me is in case of fire or other emergency is you unplug it and can carry all your files pictures in it out the door with you

Simulation of non-uniform sediment transport in a German reservoir with the SSIIM model and sensitivity analysis
Numerical models have been widely used to calculate long-term sediment deposition and erosion in reservoirs. This study investigates the river morphodynamic processes in the Iffezheim reservoir at the Upper Rhine River in Germany with non-uniform bed composition. The computational fluid dynamic model SSIIM is applied to calculate the flow. SSIIM solves the three-dimensional Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the k-_ turbulence model on unstructured grids. The suspended load transport is simulated with the convection-diffusion equation, and the equilibrium sediment concentration is calculated by the empirical formula of van Rijn (2007). Nine sediment size fractions are chosen to represent the non-uniform sediment mixture. The purpose of the study is to determine the sensitivity of a set of parameters on the results and investigate whether the bed elevation changes can be accurately simulated. During the simulation of the morphological changes with constant sediment inflow in the Iffezheim reservoir, it has been observed that minor changes in the morphodynamic parameters significantly influence the results concerning the sediment erosion and deposition, e.g. the settling velocity, the thickness of the sediment active layer and the numerical parameters time step and number of iterations for the sediment transport equation. The impact of these parameters on the bed change is investigated in the study and the accordingly chosen parameter values are applied in the ensuing time-dependent simulation. The erosion and deposition predictions have been compared to measured data of regular bed change surveys. The results of the simulations are in reasonably well agreement with the measured data.
It didn’t take long for someone to swing into action and tackle the sewage leak at the end of Gladeswood Road. These pictures came from a relieved neighbour early this afternoon.
You can never be sure if such prompt action is coincidence or not but whatever they are there have been an awful lot of them over the years.
One that definitely wasn’t coincidence was when a pothole opposite Kingswood Avenue (half way between Belvedere Asda and Lesnes Abbey) was pictured here last February.
I know it wasn’t coincidence because the man who fixed it the next day emailed me to thank me for the notification.
Whilst I was driving down to see the sewage leak yesterday I noticed that pothole was back bigger and better than ever.
It is very welcome to have reports with accompanying photos. Without them it is sometimes near impossible to construct a useful story.

Alan Butler – 82 today! – recalls D-Day, when soldiers camped in the front garden of 14 London Road, and the woods became a military zone…
We had Italian Prisoners of War in the area where I was. Where they were billeted, I don’t know. They weren’t billeted in the village, but they used to turn up on a lorry, and then go off to the different farms where they were allocated. We never saw any German Prisoners of War.
It could have been a month or six weeks before D-Day that the troops arrived. Several times they were moved on and then you found them at another part of the village. They got them to pack all their gear and depart and ride around and come back.
Some soldiers were actually billeted with us. They had their tent in the front garden of 14 London Road (I suppose it was about 18 foot square). They’d put a big tarpaulin up, or several tarpaulins up, and would sleep under these tarpaulins in their sleeping bags in a big makeshift tent.
There was only one time when they slept in the house, when a sudden shower came on, and the sides of the tarpaulin were rolled up for headroom, and all their bedding got wet, or some of them. So my mother said they could sleep in the house.
My dad was a policeman and when he finished his shift, in the early hours of the morning, he couldn’t get into the house, because there were soldiers asleep on all the chairs and settees, on the staircase, and some were sleeping on the dining room table, and some under the dining room table. The house was full of soldiers. They didn’t go upstairs (they might have gone upstairs to use the toilet), and we boys and my mother – my grandmother was there at that time – had our own bedrooms. My dad came in, found out he couldn’t get upstairs to use the bathroom or go to bed, so he went back to the police station, which was only two doors away, and had a little kip there, until all the soldiers departed.
My grandmother Mary Harcourt did her bit for the war effort, so my father said, by teaching the British army how to play Mahjongg. I’ve known my grandmother at the table with three soldiers, and, because only four can play at a time, other soldiers were sitting on chairs there waiting for their turn to have a game of Mahjongg.
14 London Road was a open house for soldiers, and Cowplain generally was very soldier-friendly. Some families adopted some of the soldiers. My second cousin, Joan, married one of the soldiers, Bill Starkey. He was in the woods, The Queen’s Inclosure, and because he was good at football, he had to be got out, so he could play football for the army football team. He had to be found a job. What his job was in the woods, I don’t know. They knew all the plans, more than likely, for when D-Day was going to happen in there.
So Bill came out, and the only job they could think for him was as a military policeman, so they gave him the job of making some village roads one-way. My second cousin Joan was driving her father’s grocer’s van, and objected to being stopped by Bill and told she couldn’t go down this road. From these inauspicious beginnings they started a relationship, and during the war, when Bill was still in the army, he came home on leave and they got married. It was rather a rush wedding. My mother gave one jar of cherished preserve fruit in a kilner jar to help with the wedding breakfast. He survived the war and eventually lived next door to my parents. He finished up his playing years with the Cowplain football team.
My mother charged accumulators. Accumulators were the power behind batteries for wirelesses, and they had to be charged up nearly once a week. An officer would come along to my mother and have his solid pack accumulators charged up for his wireless. My mother was horrified one day when he turned up at the side door of 14 London Road (there were three doors to 14 London Road) escorted by two military policemen. My mother thought that he was in trouble. But he wasn’t. He simply had to come out of the woods, which was a secure area, to collect the battery. The policemen were to make sure he didn’t talk to anybody about what was happening in the woods. Normally he collected a battery and left one, but this time he didn’t leave any.
Just before D-Day the soldiers were all issued with French currency, and my mother was given two of these franc notes, which I have in my collection. And then, at Christmas, some soldiers sent my mother Christmas cards, which I’ve got in my collection too. One reads “To Reggie, Michael and Alan,” that is, the children in the household, “with best wishes, John”. And this from the 20th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery: “To our good friends of Cowplain, with every good wish for Christmas and the New Year from the Gunners of Spring, 1944.” That phrase, “the Gunners of Spring”, suggests that soldiers were in Cowplain earlier than I thought: if D-Day was in June, they must have been in the village at the back end of spring.
That’s how much they thought of us. A couple of things were always in short supply at our house: sugar (we went through an awful lot of sugar), and tea too was very scarce. The soldiers gave my mother either one or two big bags of tea. The tea they were issued with didn’t come in packets, they were in small bags, about nine inches square, and it was full of tea, with a draw cord at the top, to keep it fresh. My mother was given two of these bags as a parting gift. Whether they gave her any other food out of their supply, I don’t know, but I’ll always remember the tea.
My mother would let the soldiers use the bath. Because they had none or very basic washing facilities, a cold shower perhaps, she let them have use of the bath. And one day a lieutenant came to the door, a complete stranger, and said to my mother, “I understand that this is the house that I can have a bath at.” And my mother said yes. And so he left her sixpence to pay for his bath. The soldiers she didn’t charge at all, but she took the sixpence from the lieutenant.
Cowplain took evacuees from London and Portsmouth. I can remember an endless stream of cars and wheelbarrows coming out of Portsmouth one evening, when I was a child. Halls and churches put them up. They would accommodate them until they found somewhere to live.
Huts were built in some spare ground in Hart Plain Avenue (where Hart Plain Avenue joined Silvester Road) for more evacuees, but the evacuees never came. They stayed empty for a long time, and then it was decided to turn these wooden huts into a junior school, because we had no junior school in the village, and when the war started, it was overwhelmed by children.
I’d been moved to the senior school. In Cowplain you had a huge great senior school that had a catchment area of Waterlooville, Purbrook, Denmead, Widley and went as far as Rowland’s Castle but didn’t include Havant. It was a funny old radius actually: it went to the top of Portsdown Hill. And then the other way it went to Denmead, Hambledon, Horndean, Clanfield, Lovedean. At one time it was mixed, but then they divided it so you had girls in one half, and boys in the other half. Separate provision was made for the girls and boys. There was no contact with girls that I can remember.
When there was an air-raid, we, the juniors, went up to the shelters. And it was a good old walk to get to the air-raid shelters from the school, about 200 hundred yards, and we were allocated the first one, because we couldn’t walk very fast. We were only little tots. And the senior boys went to the classrooms we had just vacated and trusted to the blast walls to protect them. Luckily, it only ever happened once as far as I can remember. We had dummy runs, but there was actually only once we had an air-raid and were evacuated to the shelters.
So there was one air-raid when we were all summoned there, and the other ones were dummy runs. And you had to put your gas mask on, and they were the most unpleasant things going, because they would steam up in no time at all. I would hate to have to wear one in a gas attack. Any rate, it never happened, thank goodness.
These wooden huts, as I say, had been built, and never used, and then, as I say, it was decided to turn them into a junior school. And so about 1942 (yeah, it would have been about 1942), we were moved from the senior school over into the huts. They were terrible. All you had was a big stove in the middle, and it was the job of somebody in the class (there was big buckets of coal there: I think it was coal, it might have been anthracite) to keep these stoves topped up in the winter. And the classrooms were still cold even with the stoves on. We had to wear our coats in class, they were that cold. Because the stoves radiated a little bit of heat, and beyond that, nothing.
This map shows our house – the red is 14 London Road (that’s the length of our garden) – and the territory the army took over.
Have you got the photograph I took of the bombs? The drawing pins are the bombs we had. One landed on a poultry farm and killed hundreds of chickens, and the other was at the top of Park Lane. See that square building there? That was one of the old tram sheds. Fodens had it – I didn’t know this until recently virtually – and they were storing torpedoes in there, for submarines. Perhaps I didn’t notice them come, or perhaps they all travelled at nighttime, I don’t know, but somebody knew about them, and the Luftwaffe tried to bomb it, and they were just that little bit out: they bombed the other side of the road (the corner of Park Lane), the bottom of our road and a field. We were lucky. They were the only bombs we had in Cowplain.
As I say, the soldiers were often on the move, and the HQ, we found out afterwards, was Southwick House, which was five miles by road. It’s a museum now, with the layout for D-Day.
Of course, D-Day was cancelled at the last minute, because the weather was that bad. The weather was blowing a storm and it was just impossible, so D-Day was put back a day to the 6th of June. The weather people were involved for a long time to predict a good day for the invasion, but they got it completely wrong. Meteorology then was not the advanced art it is today.
So they all departed. The village was quite empty of tanks, vehicles and guns. We did have some tanks: there were a lot of Bren Gun Carriers (you had a trailer behind the Bren Gun Carrier, and then a small field gun towing behind the trailer). And they all departed. What made my parents’ property quite attractive, was the very wide piece of grass from the edge of the road to the fence of the house (at one time the Horndean Light Railway tram ran along there), and so they army was able to park their vehicles well off the road. Now it was empty.
It was the evening of the 5th of June and suddenly there were aeroplanes in the sky. We looked up, and there were Airspeed Oxfords (they were mainly Oxfords) towing Horsa gliders. They went over the house and we had a good view from the back of the house because the ground dropped a bit. The woods were three quarters of a mile away, and visibility ceased after the woods. But you can imagine, the sky was full of planes. As far as we could see to our right, and as far as we could see to our left, the whole sky was full of aeroplanes and gliders, spaced quite apart but limitless. That’s when we realised that some action was going to take place.
This was getting dusk, at ten o’clock or eleven o’clock at night, so it wouldn’t be long before it would be dark, and then they would fly across the Channel into France, and the planes would shed their gliders, and the gliders would land with the airborne troops inside them.
Mind you, that happened again several weeks later. They wanted to secure a bridge in Holland. They didn’t succeed actually. They couldn’t secure it and the Germans took the bridge, but they did their best, and again the sky was full of Oxfords and Horsa gliders.

This is not a normal practice for me, but he had done the same for me upon his graduation from this university. While it was a little late, I still felt the need to reciprocate.
I did not email or Facebook message my letter. The fact is that I did not even use electronics in the process at all. I created this document the old-fashioned way.
I sat down with my pen and my pad of paper, and I began writing. The words began to flow from my mind into my pen, and appeared in cursive print on a previously blank page. The letter ended up being three pages long.
There was something that felt especially good about communicating in this way, especially when I stuffed the letter into an envelope, stamped and sealed it, addressed it and dropped it into the mailbox.
It felt more personal and it seemed to come more naturally. The thoughts just seemed to flow, and I needed very little time to stop and think about what I wanted to say. There were a few scribbles, but I liked what I had when the process was over.
It makes me wonder if we miss something in doing everything using electronics. That is not to say that email, Facebook and the rest are not important or useful, but that we may get a little too wrapped up in it for our own good.
The fact is that when you use pen to put something on paper, it will remain on that paper for the rest of its existence. Even if you use whiteout, or if you scribble it out, it will remain on the page.
This permanence is probably a good thing. Many studies have shown that people are more likely to remember something if they know they will not have access to the information again. I am sure that knowing you won’t be able to make edits could do something to help you think about it before you say it.
It allows us to be more thoughtful with our words, much in the same way that saying something to a person’s face influences us to be more considerate of the other person. And it is a process that helps you to reflect on the subject you are writing about, with the only thing to observe being the words on the page in front of you.
Other advantages to electronic communication are that it cuts down on distractions and takes less of your energy. It has been shown that staring at screens for long periods can reduce your energy level, among other things, and that it is much easier to be distracted when using electronic devices.
In certain circumstances, it may even help show how much you care, or how important the subject is to you. The fact that you put in a little more effort to actually write the letter might mean a lot to the receiver.
Humans communicated this way for centuries. Cicero, the apostles, medieval kings and queens and our own founding fathers shared their thoughts and ideas using this process.

Ron Heavyside passed away this Saturday, April 14th. He had been quite well recently, but this week he had stomach pain and was admitted to Bethesda Memorial Hospital in Boynton Beach. The exact cause of his passing is unknown and additional details and information about memorial and services will be announced as soon as they are available.
These notes are some of the memories I have of my longtime friend. They are random and in no way meant to be a comprehensive history. The timeline is in no special order, just like Ron.
He was born three weeks after me in 1948 and his family moved to Briny Breezes, Florida in 1962. Ron and I met in high school in 1964, just after I started surfing. He became a design artist with surfboards as his art. I remember Heavyside as one of the first two students at Seacrest High School who shocked everyone in 1964 by wearing their hair ungreased, dry and over their forehead, the same way as the new band, The Beatles. That same year Ron put me in touch with Randy Tubbs. Randy sold me his 1951 Ford woody for $35.00. Half the wood was gone but I drove it for a couple years and sold it for $45.00, always thankful to Ron for helping me find my first drive.
Fast forward to few years ago. While I was on a trip to Hawaii, Darrick Doerner took me to Dick Brewer’s glassing operation on Oahu’s North Shore. As we walked in, I said “Wow, this place reminds me of the old Nomad factory in Hypoluxo.” The glasser looked up at me and said, “Do you know Ron Heavyside?” “I taught him to repair dings in Delray Beach in 1964.” That glasser was the legendary Jack Reeves and he was happy to show me around the place, while reminiscing about working with Ron more than 50 years ago.

So that’s how Ron Heavyside got his start making surfboards. It was at Delray Sporting Goods, fixing dings with Jack Reeves as his mentor. They made boards under the “Caribbean Surfboards” label. The store’s surfboard rental business included about 100 boards that would all be rented by 10am on some weekends. Ron learned to glass the “popout” blanks first, and then made custom Caribbean Surfboards still in high school. Johnny Mac Bird was Ron’s wood shop class teacher in 1965, and since Johnny Mac was a surfer, he got the plans and Ron was one of three students who made hollow wooden boards with plywood decks and pine rails. This board, along with other examples of Ron’s innovative shapes, are part of the collection of the Surfing Florida Museum in Lake Park, Florida.
After learning to make surfboards in Delray with Jack Reeves, Ron got together with four friends to open the Nomad Surfboards factory on Hypoluxo Road in 1967. (This was the same year Ted James opened Fox Surfboards a couple miles up the road in Lantana.) Each of Ron’s four friends chipped in $250 to start the factory. Ron bought a dozen blanks and a barrel of Dion Resin and Nomad Surfboards was born. After selling quite a few boards that year, Ron was given a small space for a retail showroom in 1968 by his father. It was a 12’x16’ part of his father’s TV shop on A1A in Briny Breezes. Nomad Surf Shop opened there in 1968 and I wrote about the opening in a “Surfing News” column I wrote for the Delray News Journal at the time. The factory craftsman included Ron’s first partner Greg Stickney, along with Ron’s first glasser Gary McGee, known now as “Burry Redbaggies”. Carmen Irving was a primary shaper for Nomad and hand-shaped thousands of boards with Ron over the years.
Paul Aho was another artist in the group, who designed most of the Nomad logos and did custom resin pin lines and other art on the boards. Paul recently authored the book “Surfing Florida, A Photographic History”. Right after opening the Nomad factory, Ron visited fellow-artist Bill Ogden in California and paid him $100 to design a Nomad Surfboards logo. That logo is still in use today. Others who influenced the 1960’s “evolution” of Ron Heavyside and Nomad Surfboards were Donald Takayama and David Nuuhiwa, who vacationed with Ron each year in conjunction with Surf Expo. About 20 years ago I asked Ron who influenced him most in surfboard design and production. Ron said he learned much about glossing technique from Tony Channin and shaping from Mike Diffenderfer and Sid Madden. Ron Heavyside’s glossing talents were right there with the East Coast’s best in the day; Skip Ledingham and Fred Grosskreutz. Ron contracted with Disney World to produce hundreds of resin tables for their restaurants and he glassed many hatch-cover tables and resin-topped bars for local establishments.

Nomad Surfboards was one of the first five exhibitors at what would become Surf Expo. In 1975, ESA held an event called the “Eastern Surfing Summit” in Virginia Beach as part of the ESA’s annual board of directors meeting. There were about seven exhibitors in a room off the lobby at the Holiday Inn. In 1976 the first actual Surf Expo was held in Cocoa Beach and we have a few photos of Ron’s Nomad Surfboards booth at that trade show.
In 1969 I organized my first big surfing contest at Boynton Public Beach. Nomad donated the first place trophy for the men’s division and there were more than 100 entries. After many heats surfing some great wind chop, Ron won the first place trophy that he had donated. So he was also a great surfer and his smooth style factored in the win.

Ron Heavyside was independent. That’s what nomads are. He was unique and did things his own way, when he wanted and how he wanted. I remember calling on Ron as a Costa Del Mar Sunglasses sales rep in 1983. Sometimes it would take a few appointments to finally write an order, or Ron would get interrupted and disappear. Ron could also be generous to a fault. Even if you were just a friend of a friend, you might find your purchase rung up at half off by Ron or his wife Beth. Ron married Beth Walsh in 1974 and she became an expert buyer for womens’ resort fashions, including many well-heeled Palm Beach socialites. Do that too often and you run your business into the ground, but with a prime location on A1A, Ron and Beth built Nomad into a million-dollar operation. At one point there were three retail locations as well as the factory, and after 5 expansions the A1A location became the largest surf shop in Florida. On the men’s side, Jimmy Buffet and Rod Stewart became regular customers.

The Nomad factory operation was managed by Ron, while Beth ran the ladies’ side of the store. At one point in the 1970’s, Nomad Surfboards was one of the best-selling surfboards on the U.S. East Coast, turning out more than 40 boards per week and wholesaling boards to dozens of surf shops from Miami to New Hampshire. The Nomad Surf Team was a dominant force on the East Coast competition scene at the time, along with Fox Surfboards from West Palm Beach. Nomad Team riders included 1972 East Coast Men’s Champion Carmen Irving. Other champion team riders included Paul Aho, Kevin Grondin, the Neumann brothers, Rusty Fleetwood, Lenny Nichols, Ozzie Winchester and members of the Cripple Creek Surf Club based at Boynton Inlet. Nomad was also a leader in early skateboarding, manufacturing some of the first laminated decks with kicktails. The Nomad skate team included future Hall of Fame legends Chuck Lagana, Mike Folmer and Scott McCranels, and the team held its own with the original Fox Skateboard Team until Fox became more dominant. The Nomad factory location was a stone’s throw from the infamous “Hypoluxo Ditch”, part of the concrete drainage system installed when I-95 was being constructed in the 1970’s. Nomad skate team trials and memorable sessions took place there.

Ronnie, Ron’s older son, eventually became manager of Nomad and now he and his younger brother Ryan share management of all things Nomad, still at the original location for 50 years. Ronnie is a great surfer and was also talented enough for a baseball scholarship (his swing was compared to Ted Williams) but he chose to stay close to surfing and the shop. Ryan became a pro surfer after qualifying in the 1996 U.S. Team Trials in Huntington Beach for Surfing America’s U.S. Team. He became a menswear model and still travels frequently for photo shoots and freesurfing. Their friend Peter Mendia has been a Nomad team rider for many years.
Ryan and Ronnie continue Ron’s philosophy of giving back to the local surfing community. Nomad has sponsored annual ESA contests for decades and routinely supports local Surfrider Foundation and Surfing Florida Museum events.
Ron Heavyside was nominated to the East Coast Surfing Hall of Fame in 2016, and again this year. He is also nominated for the Florida Skateboard Hall of Fame. I’m sure he will be included as a worthy inductee with the next ballots.
Hundreds of shop employees, surfboard craftsmen, Nomad team riders and loyal customers have been part of the success of Nomad Surfboards and Nomad Surf Shop over the past 50 years.

“Waiting for the tide to come in can seem like an eternity when you know the potentially magical moments the tide can unlock,” Vissla says of their latest Spring 2017 Collection video. “Eric Geiselman passes the time by filling the air with noodling around on the guitar exerting melodies as random as a field of psychedelic flowers. When the tide gets just right he’ll trade the guitar for his closest board and find any sections asking to be shredded to pieces. The Tide Riders collection would be the result if you took your standard florals to Woodstock and let them soak in the atmosphere for a few days. With psychedelic swirling flowers, dots, twists and turns it’s not your father’s wardrobe!”

The 'Kingdom' has a maze of blissfully quiet country lanes each of which has a story to tell - Around every corner, a piece of history unfolds amidst the most beautiful of scenery.
There are tiny fishing villages, early Christian ruins, and Irelands highest mountain. There is nothing quite like the exhilaration of travelling through quiet country roads and unspoilt villages off the beaten track.
Located in the extreme southwest of Ireland, the County of Kerry boasts of its outstanding and magnificent sceneries such as the Ring of Kerry and a very well-preserved eighteenth-century century port in Tralee, its capital town.
The county of Kerry is traditionally known by both locals and tourists as “the kingdom.” Past visitors were charmed by its breathtaking plains, which really do look like those kingdoms you would often see in movies and read in books.
Kerry has two contrasting and distinguishing types of terrain. These are the smaller areas that look like plains and that stretch from north to Shannon Estuary and the mountainous and elevated lands in the south in Beara, Ivearagh, and Dingle peninsulas. Regions of scenic beauty are found along the coast where sandy beaches alternate with cliffs and rocky headlands.
Most tourists explore Kerry with a rail and coach tour, which makes the experience very medieval. You can look out of the windows during the coach tour and see for yourself the spectacular drive from Tralee to Brandon.

The driver of the vehicle that knocked down and killed thirty-four-year-old Richard Canti in Orange Walk Town remains at large. Today his family is seeking answers and is asking the public for their assistance in locating the vehicle and the driver. His sister, Elva Canti told Love News that the family is prepared to offer a monetary reward to anyone who can help with any leads. Canti had left his house early Wednesday morning and was headed to work when he was knocked down and killed.
“Up to now the only report that we have is that he left his house approximately between 5:15 to 5:20, I really don’t know what happened after that. That’s when we received the report that an accident had happened. Up to now we still haven’t received any clarification of any vehicle or any license plate or what color vehicle it is- we don’t have anything clear as yet. We are still trying to find out any information that we could get and by the way we are offering a reward for any information that we can get from the community, whoever saw when this happened because there were people that were already out there when this happened and we are really asking for assistance from the public and any information; they don’t have to provide us with their name it could be anonymous but we need at least the license plate, at least the person, the color of the vehicle and where it can be located. Apart from being a hardworking person who was very humble, yes he had his ups and downs but we didn’t receive any complaints that he got violent with anyone here in the village or out in town. We haven’t received any report like that, he was seen as a humble person.”
Canti’s body was found around six o’clock Wednesday morning on the Belize Corozal Road. His bicycle was found a few feet away from him with the back wheel damaged. He was hit by an unknown vehicle from behind and left on the side of the road. The driver of the vehicle fled the scene. Police report that the 34-year-old had sustained head and body injuries and was pronounced dead on arrival at the Northern Regional Hospital. Canti leaves behind his wife and four children. His family says he was the sole breadwinner for his family.

We’ve shared in the past why big box chain stores might not be the best thing for a community, not just because they put small retail shops out of business – costing the community a lot of money and causing a net loss of jobs – but also, when they decide they aren’t making enough…
We’ve talked a lot about why shopping local is good for Cape Cod’s economy and for our local businesses, but what if we told you that shopping local is also really good for you, as an individual? We get it – modern day humans are constantly seeking ontological security (fancy terminology, we know). Ontological security…
Millennials. The word, and generation, has developed a negative connotation in our society. However, most of these concepts, judgements, and ideas about what millenials are, or aren’t, doing are coming from older generations who are quick to offer criticism, but not solutions. Millenials have been raised in a “McDonaldized” world, as we grew up things…

Last month we told you how Amazon makes its money, and how they use the data they gather through Amazon Web Services to manipulate which entrepreneurial ventures succeed, but have you ever considered how they intend to use the data they are collecting on you? And trust us they are collecting a TON of data…
It’s true that we have been writing a lot about Amazon lately. And though some people might think we shouldn’t be focusing on what might be perceived as “negative” matters, we feel in an economic landscape where transparency and information about certain companies isn’t readily available, it is important to educate consumers about certain aspects…
Even if you’ve never taken an economics class, you’ve definitely heard and seen the terms tax avoidance, antitrust, and monopoly thrown around on the news or in headlines on social media. What you may not have thought about is that these are all intrinsic to Amazon’s business model, whether in their startup phase, their present…
In addition to the perceived convenience of online shopping, another reason consumers give for not shopping local is that it is “more expensive” to shop at a small business than it is to shop at a big box store or online. This is certainly not a new perception, and however false it might be, it…
In our Consumer Shopping Survey, respondents noted convenience as one of the main reasons they choose e-commerce over shopping local. But how much of this convenience is perception and not 100% rooted in reality? The definition of Inconvenience is “giving trouble or causing annoyance.” So, let’s say you are an Amazon Prime member, and because…
From NoLita to the Bay Area, retail collectives are popping up everywhere.

Selective androgen receptor modulators, also known as SARMs, are an exclusive type of molecules that are being created to treat illnesses that are presently being cured with anabolic-androgenic steroids. Several SARMs have even worked to test for testosterone replacement therapy.
This is a SARM like Ostarine. However, it’s 12x more powerful at 1/3 dose only. It’s consequently more oppressive to the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Testes-Axis. This is the gonadal glands, pituitary gland, and hypothalamus system that play an important role in the regulation and development of the immune and reproductive systems. That is why; a SERM post cycle therapy is suggested.
MK 677 is a selective, orally active, and non-peptidic agonist of the growth hormone receptor. It copies the ghrelin action. Ghrelin is the hormone that controls appetite and the rate of use and distribution of energy in the stomach.
Actually, this isn’t a SARM. The truth is that it is a PPAR Delta Modulator. This is a selective agonist with a high similarity for the PPAR. This modulation lets the body to create more muscle tissues and uses more glucose.
This SARM is very new. That is why there is not a lot of real-world information on it yet. But, it does look really auspicious. It has an amazing anabolic to androgenic ratio of 90:1. Meaning, people who use this could experience a wealth of muscle building effects without all the linked side effects of androgenic.
This is likely the most popular SARM. It’s best utilized to reserve the mass of muscle while in a caloric shortage. This SARM could and would subdue the natural production of testosterone in higher, longer dosed cycles. That is why a SERM post cycle therapy is required.

Summary report of IFCA National Conference held in Letterkenny, 23-25 October 2015 Fostering well-being: together we can make a difference
Although the distances between starships in the usual space combat are huge, measuring hundreds of thousand, if not millions of kilometres, there are occasions when the combat is at such close quarters that the third dimension will make a difference. The above is just one example, where one combatant (Khan) used WWII naval tactics, whereas the other (Kirk) took advantage of the special circumstances of space combat.
On the whole, though, in wargaming starship combat, the third dimension is, on the whole, ignored. Why?
Well, the most obvious answer is simplicity. A major problem with using the third dimension in space combat, is that, unlike aircraft combat, there is no "minimum" (i.e. the ground) or "maximum" (i.e. the aircraft's ceiling) altitude. Two starship models could be an inch apart, but due to "height" differences, separated by two or more feet. The second problem is firing-arcs. Exactly how far can a phaser bank elevate? Are disrupters fitted on swivel mounts? However, with the world of Star Trek, most of these problems can be overcome.
These rules are an addition for Star Trek - Full Thrust, although they can easily be adapted for any rules or universe in use.
There is a Level 0, that represents the standard "Galactic Plane", from which all starship navigation is taken. The other levels run from +30, to -30, giving a total of 61 Levels. Each level, for firing purposes, counts as one inch of range, and when firing, the number of levels between the two vessels are counted.
Example: USS Excelsior is at Level +8, at a distance of two inches from a Klingon Bird of Prey. The Klingon vessel is at level -2, so the overall range is 13 inches ( two inches, plus eleven inches for the 'height" difference). When calculating the height difference, Level 0 is also counted if passed through.
The firing arcs do not have to be revised. The USS Enterprise is quoted in most technical journals as having six phasers, in three banks of two. However, if you study the model, she has three banks on the underside of the saucer, and three banks atop the saucer. My own personal viewpoint is that she has six phaser "power cells", but twelve phaser "firing points" This means that only six phasers can be fired at a time, but it enables her to fight effectively in three-dimensional combat (a blatant fudge, I know, but it works for my purposes. And if anyone mentions the Enterprise-D in "Best Of Both Worlds".... ).
Okay, so on this one, there is no easy answer. The best that I can come up with is this. Any starship, regardless of velocity, may travel up or down one level, without using up any movement. Up to half of a starship's velocity may be expended on vertical movement, although this is not lost (a starship is not fighting gravity in a climb). Additionally, a starship may expend Thrust points for level changes.
Example: A starship travelling at a velocity of ten, is being pursued by three enemy vessels on the same level. In an attempt to confuse the pursuers, the Captain elects to try to alter levels. The starship has a Thrust Rating of 4, and applies all that to increase levels. She also uses it's free altitude change, and half it's movement, to gain a net increase of ten Levels. This may seem a trifle excessive at first, but, in theory, a starship could do a "course change,, to straight up, at whatever velocity the ship is travelling at currently.
Another urgent note: Any ship that travels either "above" Level +30, or below Level -30, has disengaged, and uses the regular rules for attempting to rejoin the battle.
Well, there you have it, I leave the means of marking the starship's height to you. One good way is to use "poker chips", one colour for positive, and a different colour for negative Levels. Another way is to use dice, but even scribbled notes on paper will suffice.
Standard Car 4x2, or Car Armoured Light Standard, better known as the Beaverette, was a British armoured car produced during World War II.
Don't remember the manufacturer. After a bit of internet research I believe it is an old SDD miniature. Not convinced totally, but other miniatures in the box it was in carry SDD codes.
I have painted this model. I gave the model a black undercoat, a dark green base coat and "weathered" it with some brown paint.
Art collectors of ArtKabinett social media network will have the opportunity to view the largest work by the Spanish born artist in America
The curtain was donated by the Landmarks Conservancy to the New York Historical Society and after considerable conservation will be exhibited to the public, later this spring.
The Le Tricorne curtain was installed as a tapestry for 55 years at the Four Seasons Restaurant in the Mies van der Rohe-designed, modernist, Seagram Building, in New York City.
The painted curtain was controversially removed by the building's art collecting new owner Abi Rosen, who according to the New York Times referred to the masterpiece “as a schmatte”—Yiddish for a rag.
“He said it was a rag,” stated a horrified Phyllis Lambert, the well known Canadian architect and Seagram heiress, who oversaw the creation of the Seagram Building and bought the curtain in 1957.
Rosen who collects Warhol and Hirst among others notoriously pissed off his suburban neighbors by erecting a 13-ton, 33-foot-high painted bronze sculpture by Damien Hirst which he placed on his 5.5-acre estate, depicting a pregnant woman, with the skin peeled back on one side exposing her fetus.
"Le Tricorne has been an icon of New York for more than half a century, embodying both an influential social milieu and an important moment in the city’s cultural development,” said Louise Mirrer, President and CEO of the New-York Historical Society. “As an institution that preserves, studies, and exhibits the artifacts of a continually changing city, we are proud to welcome the work into our permanent collection.”
Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) was commissioned to design and paint the stage curtain for the two-act ballet The Three-Cornered Hat (“Le Tricorne” or “El sombrero de tres picos”) by the impresario Serge Diaghilev for his avant-garde, Paris-based Ballets Russes -- the most influential ballet company of the early 20th century and a crucible of experimental modernism.
Picasso was most intensely involved with the Ballets Russes while married to Olga Khokhlova, a dancer with the troupe. Choreographed by Léonide Massine who was also the principal male dancer, with music by the Spanish composer Manuel de Falla, Le Tricorne was based on a Spanish romantic novella and featured fiery flamenco and folkloric dances.
Picasso created the curtain for Le Tricorne over a period of three weeks in 1919 in London with Diaghilev’s scene painter Vladimir Polunin and his wife Elizabeth Violet. Working with paintbrushes affixed to broom-handles and toothbrushes, Picasso and the Polunins wore slippers to stand on the canvas as they painted.
The ballet -- which premiered on July 22, 1919, at the Alhambra Theatre in London, with sets, costumes and the monumental stage curtain by Picasso -- was a resounding critical success.
Shown during Le Tricorne’s overture, Picasso’s curtain signaled a quintessentially Spanish vignette: a bullfight. In the foreground of the painting, five spectators and a young fruit vendor are watching the bullfight from a classicizing colonnaded balcony.
In the background, a slain bull is dragged out of the arena, the violent image partially concealed by spectators. The scene is painted in ochre yellow and reddish orange, the traditional colors of the bullring, and the figures are outlined in black, in the bold style of posters then in vogue. Although unrelated to the libretto’s plot, Picasso’s curtain clearly set the Iberian mood for the ballet.
In 1928, in need of money to finance new shows, Diaghilev cut out the center of the large curtain and sold it to a private collector.
In 1957, it was first acquired by Phyllis Lambert, architectural historian and daughter of Samuel Bronfman, CEO of the Seagram Company Ltd. (now Vivendi), who displayed it in the Four Seasons restaurant in the Seagram Building from 1959-2014.
Vivendi gifted Picasso’s Le Tricorne curtain to the New York Landmarks Conservancy in 2005 as a “Gift to the City.” The Conservancy has now entrusted the New-York Historical Society with this New York City landmark.

The origins of Lucca know very poco.Quasi certainly rose in pre-Roman era, in a marshy area between Lake Bientina and Serchio, his name was, in fact, the Ligurian-Celtic origins, "luk" just means "village surrounded by water ". The city was dominated by Ligurian and Etruscans, until 180 BC when it became a Roman colony, taking the name of Luke.
After the fall of the Roman Empire, Lucca was invaded by the Goths and Lombards, under which reached a high degree of prosperity, becoming the seat of kings and the regional capital.
Thanks to the solid walls of which are used in 940 to a lobster invasion of Hungarians, fights' against Pisa in 1004, and to submit to Canossa not accept 'the arrival in Italy of Henry III.
Thriving commercial center, took Lucca progressively control over the Plains and the Versilia. In 1118 will constitute 'as a free municipality and became the capital of one of the three Ducati which was divided in Tuscany.
There were, however, also moments of great difficulty so that in 1234 Lucca had to submit to Pisa and Florence.
The struggle between Guelphs and Ghibellines led to Lucca in 1314 Uguccione of Faggiuola, and Ghibelline tyrant of Pisa, after he was released from Castruccio Castracani.
With the lordship of Castruccio Castracani, Lucca undertaken a series of wars of conquest that culminated in the taking of Pistoia and the expansion in high Lunigiana to Pontremoli. The sudden death of Castracani marked the beginning of a sad period for the city that was conquered by Pisa in 1342 and released by the Charles IV of Bohemia until 1369.
In early 1400, with Paul Guinigi, Lucca experienced a period of peace and prosperity. At his fall, in 1430, was restored to the republican regime, remained in force until 1799.
Lucca in 1805 became the principality, then the Duchy of Maria Luisa of Bourbon, from 1817 to 1824, finally entered the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.
Lucca is enclosed in its sixteenth large walls. Their construction dates back to 1504, during the Republic of Lucca.
The walls are interrupted by 11 ramparts. Inside the rampart of San Martino you can see the layout of the old gunner.
Today you can make long Walking on the walls through the tree-lined avenue, they offer interesting glimpses of the city.
Perhaps not everyone knows that under Lake Screeners, in Lucca, more precisely in Garfagnana, is a small country.
Once fact, in this great valley, some craftsmen had built a small factory, Careggine factory where they worked marble and of them a little, given the prosperity that they obtain, it was built around a small community.
In 1953 the village was submerged by the dam of Lake Screeners, but every ten years, because of maintenance work, it is emptied and millions of visitors flock to enjoy the spectacle of the town reemerged.
"Ponte del Diavolo" or "Magdalen Bridge" is in the town of Chislehurst near the Garfagnana. Combining the two banks of the Serchio and its reconstruction was wanted by Castruccio Castracani.
The name derives from the deck of popular legend that a mason, taken from the fear of failing to complete on time the bridge, churches aid Devil, who promised to help in one night on condition that he grant him a soul them to cross the bridge. The builder agreed, but on the draw, did cross the bridge to a hog, making a mockery of the Devil who disappeared between the waters of the river.
IIP Essential Components Checklist – Fillable Oct 2013 – SSTs and Administrators must review IIPs using the Ministry of Education’s checklist by October 31st of each year. The completed and signed checklist should be uploaded to the IIP Files and Links tab by Nov. 15th.
GSSD Guidelines for Team Development of Inclusion and Intervention Plans – SSTs and PSPs please review these procedures as they outline your role in this process.
Technical issues should be reported to your SSC or you can email TPM directly @ tpmsupport@leadershipservicesteam.ca.
An Inclusion and Intervention Plan (IIP) is a plan developed and implemented by a collaborative team. It is a compilation of student outcomes that have the highest priority for the student during the year. IIPs include:
The classroom teacher’s input into a student’s IIP is vital. Classroom teachers should ensure that classroom activities support the student in achieving their IIP goals and effective EA utilization can further support goal development for student that require EA support.
While Student Support Teachers are the case managers regarding IIP development, they shouldn’t write IIP goals in isolation. Team collaboration is essential in creating collaborative plans that address the needs of student and connect to the classroom environment. IIPs should be developed with input from classroom teachers, parents, involved professional service providers, and EAs. EAs are an important part of the student’s team, however, they should not be asked to attend a student’s team meeting in place of the classroom teacher.
The Student Support Teacher (SST) and classroom teacher must ensure EAs are aware of IIP goals for the students they support along with their specific role in supporting goal achievement. An example may include prompting and tracking student progress toward a goal on a data collection form. TEAMs must work together to support goal achievement and goals should be met at the level of independence stated in the program plan.
are working on learning outcomes that differ from those in provincial curricula for their grade level
GSSD TPM Overview of Initiatives – please refer to this powerpoint that provides a summary of how GSSD is using TPM software to create program plans for students and support variou tracking and progress monitoring initiatives.
TPM data remains in the system even after a student has moved on. These student records, however, are set to ‘Inactive’ and no longer appear in the default view. The student and their data will re-appear upon integration if/when the student returns. TPM has set Quintin up as the admin user with access to ‘inactive’ students. He is alble to view and print inactive student records by clicking on Active/InActive button at the top of their page. Please contact Quintin if you require something printed for a studnet who has moved.

After the announcement of the exit of the UK EU (European Union), elected by a referendum at the end of June, the immediate effect was a large drop in stock markets across Europe, experts point out that this output can generate lasting impacts on the global economy, says the executive Flavio Maluf.
According to numbers released by the European Union for the year 2014, the UK has contributed substantially to the organization.
However, Flavio Maluf notes that, according to the director of FN Capital operations, Paulo Figueiredo, the UK’s isolation block will result in a considerable drop in investment received by the country.
Among the EU member countries, there is a union that allows free trade without tax application and extra quotas on products from other countries. With the block output, the UK will have new rates in relation to what was practiced before, which is likely to harm the country’s foreign trade with the EU. On the other hand, says Flavio Maluf, according to the expert Otto Nogami, this output can also bring further benefits to the UK, as from now, the country may enter into bilateral agreements that were not previously reachable.
With the exit of the United Kingdom of the European Union, Brazil can benefit because it will have the chance to enter into bilateral agreements with the country.
The departure of the British EU is a great loss to the block, because it had as core countries Germany, France and the UK itself, and much of its structure is established in these three countries. Currently, France show signs of weakness and fatigue in its economy, thus it is up to Germany to sustain, in economic terms, the block. According to the president of Eucatex, Flavio Maluf, it is a great uncertainty due to the impact that this output can generate positioning of other countries that are part of the block.
Flávio Maluf is a Brazilian Businessman, mechanical engineer, graduated from the Armando Alvares Penteado Foundation (FAAP). Check him out on Twitter here.
He is president of the company Eucatex and group GrandFood and eldest son of politician Paulo Maluf.

After close scrutiny, the firm noticed that the reporting structures that it had put in place could not allow clients who own small businesses to review their reports. Consequently, most of them had lost touch with their AdWords Campaigns.
When this complaint reached White Shark Media, the firm started educating its clients about the workings of their new campaigns. Once a client is armed with this knowledge, he or she can easily locate the performance of each individual keyword or ad.
This problem bedeviled White Shark Media Complaints team for a very long time. It was a matter of great concern because communication is pertinent to the success of any consultancy agency.
During the firm’s early days, most clients felt that communication was poor because of difficulties in getting hold of a contact person within the firm. To stem this, White Shark Media implemented a number of strategies.
Scheduling monthly status calls through the Go Meeting platform was done to enhance the flow of communication. This has given the firm’s clients and strategists an opportunity to review monthly reports. This way, they can pinpoint weaknesses, which need to be addressed. Being an online conferencing platform, Go Meeting saves time and money.
Clients who complain that their old campaigns perform better than White Shark Media’s optimized campaigns are often linked with experienced supervisors. The work of these specialists is to provide regular feedback to SEM strategists, and to oversee the rollout of new campaigns.
Under the new system, the strategists work on the feedback to enhance the performance of these new campaigns. This has enabled White Shark Media to offer impressive services.

Alexei Beltyukov has not only started a scholarship for Russian students who want to attend INSEAD University, but he is also pursuing education for profitable purposes. The newest endeavor is called SOLVY. The project debuted in 2015 at the Los Angeles tech conference from EdSurge, called Educator Day. Beltyukov’s main goal is to communicate with with professionals from the educational field, including teachers. Prior to its launch, launchingnext.com named SOLVY as one of the world’s most promising start ups and it was also listed as a 100 New Startups, Today startup by BetaList.
The main purpose of the online software is to create a homework space for high school students. The software is meant to assist teachers in doing what matters. Instead of spending time creating homework, the software creates it for the teacher. It does this by following certain parameters. SOLVY also follows some of the most recent research out about testing, rather than having multiple choice questions, the software creates tests that make students show how they got to their answer. It also helps students understand the value of mistakes and learning from them.
One of the major areas that the company is growing is in the mathematics areas. It is especially helpful for teachers in creating individualized help for each student. In math class rooms especially, it can be very difficult for teachers to gauge how each student is progressing. Now a teacher can have access to each student’s work and see how they are arriving at their answers. And, rather than spending time grading each question and creating more homework, the teacher can send each student an individualized plan to help them.
LinkedIn shows that Alexei Beltyukov was born and raised in Russia and has been steadfast in his efforts to help the nation. He has been a major donor to different organizations that donate their time to helping st art up businesses in Russia. He has also given significant sums to different scholarship funds that help Russian students to pursue degrees in business. One of his most prized roles is serving as the Vice President for the Skolkovo Foundation in Russia. This organizations provides guidance to the Russian government on matters involving the economy. This guidance, and opportunities and grants, are also extended to individuals. Follow Alexei Beltyukov on Twitter for updates, or you can visit his official site.

Argentina is one of the most promising Latin American countries when it comes to sovereign debt. This is in spite of decades-long status as a distressed credit country. Simply put, distressed credit is when a loan becomes irregular in payments or when the debtor defaults completely. Argentina entered distressed credit status in 2001 when it defaulted on an impressive $95 billion in issued bonds. Even after defaulting the country continued to service its debt in a myriad of ways until 2014 when former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ignored U.S. court orders on the matter and halted all payments to holdout creditors.
The reason Argentina is still promising even with this complicated history is that it is a resource-rich country. It has a lot of growth potential because of this and if it can restructure its existing debt there is a high likelihood of credit upgrades. President Macri was elected on a campaign of economic reversal and a goal to return Argentina to the sovereign debt markets. He undid much of his predecessors work and now an upcoming U.S. court ruling looks promising to re-admit Argentina to the sovereign debt market and allow it to restructure its debt to begin payments once more.
This soon to be realized potential is great news for many holdout creditors like Highland Capital Management. The management fund is a large holder of 2033 bonds from Argentina and its president and co-founder James Dondero has made many observations about the possible profitability and return of Argentina in recent years. One of his key observations was that Argentina would eventually experience a defining moment where something would have to give. Either the government would run out of capital completely due to being restricted from the bond markets or they would change their position on restructuring their debt.
James also considers Argentina to be worthy of re-investment since it has the greatest promise of being upgraded in creditworthiness in the near future against other Latin American countries. Dondero plans on taking advantage of Argentina’s appeal not just for sovereign debt but capital investment by creating an Argentina Fund through Highland Capital Management.

If like me your old enough to remember this IRISH WATER SAFETY Television campaign from my early boyhood, then you’ll no doubt be aware that the message that our parents thought us then is the same one that parents and teachers,with the help of Irish Water Safety are still teaching children and youth today.
Children and Adults can drown in as little as a foot of water, Thats 30cm or 1/3rd of a metre in todays measurement system.Always stay vigilant around water,especially when children are involved. Whether swimming, boating, or going to rivers, lakes or coastline,everyone should know the basics of water safety.\
As the New Year approaches may we here at BellTime Magazine suggest, as a priority if you haven’t done so already, “LEARN TO SWIM” as soon as you can in2017, its not only great fun,but swimming is a brilliant way to stay fit and healthy. It may also SAVE A LIFE SOME DAY. Colm@BellTime Magazine.
Irish Water Safety offers courses for personal safety and swimming including courses leading to lifeguard certification.The Lifeguard certification you get is internationally recognised,enabling you to work at pools and beaches around the world.
When you take our classes, you learn to help yourself and others if a difficult situation unfolds in water. If you already know how to swim, build on these skills and learn how to save lives, including your own, by taking Irish Water Safety’s Lifesaving courses – you may need these skills to save yourself or a loved one someday
I had always been a strong swimmer, but had been reluctant to try my hand at lifesaving. My parents had attempted to persuade me to join rookie lifesaving on numerous occasions, but I never felt particularly compelled to go. It took three of my friends to eventually encourage me to go to IWS (Irish Water Safety). The programme is very youth orientated, the majority of instructors are still attending secondary school, however they are under supervision by more experienced instructors.
The first night I underwent a trial of sorts, a small group of hopefuls and I swam lengths the whole night and at the end I learned I had successfully passed into the ‘Rescue 1’ group, where we learned the basics of water safety and how to approach a drowning subject.
I returned enthusiastic the next week, hungry to start learning a valuable new life skill. It was that week that I found out that not only were the lessons a good time to hone my swimming skills and also learn new ones, it was also a good place to socialise with people my own age.
Fortunately my group was mostly TY or fifth year students so I wasn’t out of place. I had always thought that it would be pointless starting at my age, but it wasn’t much of a disadvantage.
There are four rescue stages, only two are necessary to become a pool lifeguard and all four are recommended to become a beach lifeguard. It takes roughly one year to complete each stage, so you have to be quite dedicated to go each week for the entire year.
About halfway through the year, one hour theory classes follow the swimming which train you in CPR and what to do once you have successfully saved someone from the water.
It is a very worthwhile skill to possess, many students in college turn to lifeguarding in pools or beaches as their primary source of income, and so do many students abroad. It opens up a whole new path in life, if you studied French for example in school, you could move to France and be almost guaranteed a job. 91 people drowned in Ireland in 2013 and in the USA around 3500 people drowned unintentionally.
It is an extremely valuable skill to have in life, and an enjoyable and friendly atmosphere to be learning in so I highly recommend it to anyone interested. John LEE 17 Cork

Per USA Today, United States President Barack Obama has decided that he is now against the release of photos detailing alleged abuse of prisoners of war in Afghanistan and Iraq. According to Pentagon spokesperson Geoff Morrell, some military commanders have raised concerns that releasing said images could aid al-Qaeda in their propaganda efforts.
The 44 images in question were part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and are slated to be released to the public on May 28th.
BeaconOfLight (Unlisted location) Obama finally realized release of pictures would put US soldiers in danger. Da, 4 as smart as he is supposed 2 B, it took him long enough.
Jamey_F (Unlisted location) Wow Obama... You actually are thinking and not releasing pictures.. Finally good job
MoBrain (Unlisted location ) Just heard Obama is blocking the pictures of "torture" under Bush Admin. I'm suspicious. Maybe Cheney hit a nerve!
MSGTAM (Woodland, WA) Sitting here thinking that President Obama made a great decision in not releasing the interrogation pictures.

Brenda Certner grew up in a small town 20 minutes outside of New York City. Exposure to her parent’s passion for fashion, art, architecture and the performing arts, she came to her true calling - interior design.
She studied art at the University of Cincinnati while apprenticing to the President of Griewe Interiors. It was a high end design company with in-house-custom workrooms for drapery, upholstery, cabinetry, and painting. Projects were designed, warehoused and installed in their entirety. This method allowed for total emersion and refined her ability to see the space right down to its smallest detail.
Brenda earned her second degree in Interior Design graduating Suma Cum Laude from the Mt. Vernon Campus of George Washington University. She won three awards for outstanding achievement. As a student she served on the Alter Guild of the Washington Cathedral designing special floral arrangements and refurbished the Alter Guild Offices in the Cathedral.
During her child rearing years, she developed an extensive collection of antique ribbons, lace, glass beads, and antique textile flowers. Utilizing these materials into wall art, she caught the interest of several buyers who featured the work and her at a special showing both at Neiman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue.
Brenda returned to her love for interior design full time when her daughters were finishing high school.
Brenda Certner Designs has been doing business in the Maryland, Virginia, and D.C. area since 1987. While the primary focus has been in Residential Design, there have been numerous Commercial Design projects from a beauty shop to the complete refurbishment of several condominium buildings in the tri-state area.
Brenda Certner Designs has custom designed and manufactured lighting, furniture, and carpeting for most all of the Commercial and Residential projects.

Mya Blair's boots are made more for sex than for walking. We get a nice view of her well-rounded ass as she makes her way up the stairs where Peter is taking a nap. Mischievous Mya wakes him up for morning sex by placing a mini-breast pump on one of his nipples. He quickly puts a lip-lock on Mya's nipples. Putting the pump on Mya's right nipple, Peter sucks on her left nip. Her big tits are soon out of her fishnet bodysuit and Peter has his hands full of boob meat. Mya wants cock, and after she gives him a blow job and ball-licking, she's ready for a different kind of pump. As he pumps her pussy, Mya licks her boobs and rubs them. Holding her by her kinky boots, Peter fucks Mya from behind. To cap off their morning pleasure, Mya gets on her back and holds her large-and-in-charge tits together, jiggling them and urging him to nut so she can see the cum land on her chest.

As I drove to work this morning, I passed middle school students out waiting for the school bus. To be honest, they looked miserable. I could just imagine what kind of things were going through their minds. I’m pretty sure all of the thoughts had something to do with not having to go to school and being back in their warm beds. That part I don’t blame them for. Its a cool, wet morning here today. But as I drove away from them, I began to think of how different I would approach school if I were starting over again. Like most other kids, I didn’t exactly like going to school. It was ok, but I couldn’t wait to be out of school when I could do what I wanted. I looked forward to graduating so I would be “free.” Oh, if I had only known then what I know now… Famous last words, right? I think about the classes I would take, how I would study more, how much more I would appreciate my teachers. And I say this as one who typically made A’s and B’s in school. I did what I had to.
As I have grown older, I have come to appreciate and place a greater value on learning. I think there is a saying about the older that you get, the more you realize how little you know. That is so true. In fact, I believe it is humbling. Now, as I move closer to a half century than I would like, I truly want to learn. I mentioned to my wife recently how my approach to preaching has changed. Why? Because I am continuing to learn.
That is something we all must do: continue learning. This isn’t just good practical advice, it is good spiritual advice too. Do you really think that you have learned all you need to learn from God? Doesn’t God tell us in scriptures to pay attention because God is about to do a new thing? God is continually revealing more to those who seek after him.
I believe that there are three main reasons that we quit seeking to learn. The first is that we become complacent. We simply feel like we have learned “enough.” The second reason is arrogance. We kid ourselves and think we know it all, or at least know all that really matters. Those two reasons are easily addressed: think again. Eat a slice of humble pie and get back to learning. However, the third reason is trickier: fear. Sometimes fear keeps us from a pursuit of learning. Why? Because we’re afraid that we might learn something that challenges our already formed opinions. Perhaps we learn that we have been wrong. Perhaps learning forces us to see things in a different way. Uncomfortable? Yes. Important? Absolutely. In fact, I believe that it is in learning God’s truth that we may be challenged more than in any other way. Learning shapes our actions. So don’t be afraid. I believe the Bible says something about that as well.

My little paradise had an old internal dirt road, but it was eroded, overgrown, and being just dirt, it would become unusable as soon as it rains - and it usually rains here! So it had to be improved.
This is how the road looked before work started. Lots of branches and even many entire trees fell across the road, because of the unusually heavy snowing this winter.
But of course I can't build a road just on muscle power. So I hired the service of a roadbuilding contractor. Very enthusiastic, he came in the same day to bring the first truckload of gravel - and slipped off the road. Here he is dumping the cargo, under very risky conditions.
Even empty, the truck couldn't get out on its own, in this muddy, soft soil. A large 4WD tractor had to come to rescue the truck.
Machinery starts arriving. Here comes an ages old front loader. A steep road crossing in the vicinity serves as discharge ramp.
A motor grader came on its own wheels. The driver went to work without as much as asking where he had to work, and promptly tried to drive over the old bridge! This bridge was built for 4 tons. The motor grader weighs 22 tons. Here is the result.
Using a hydraulic jack, the machine was gradually raised, and the creek was filled with firewood, until the machine rested even again and could drive out of the bridge, fully demolishing it in the process.
It was decided to build the new bridge from corrugated steel tubes, with gravel cover. Here is the truck with the material.
A retroexcavator is a very versatile machine. Here it is reformatting the road on a slope too steep for the motor grader to climb. We are doing our best to avoid damage to the trees as much as possible. This crooked, half dead Avellano tree poses special problems, but with some goodwill the machine can work around and under it.
Further up the hill, the terrain is flat enough for the machine to bulldoze. This method is much faster.
After the road had been formatted, for the first time ever I could drive my car up to the place where my house will be built!
Unfortunately it rained again after this, and very much. I had to drive down while I could. The roadbuilding work rested for about a week, until the rain was over and the road had re-solidified a bit. Then the graveling work started.
This is where the material for my road is coming from. The quarry is located about 11km away from my place. The material is taken just as it comes from there, without any processing of any sort. It's a mix of stones of different sizes, coarse sand, and clay.
On the flat parts of the road, gravelling is easy. But uphill in very soft, wet, muddy terrain, it's a different matter!
The truck also had trouble passing some Notro trees, which were bending over the road. The driver wanted to cut them down. But behind them there were only some old, dead trees, and open land! No way. I bent them back with my car's winch, and tied them into position using some wire. Six trees saved.
And then, there is the old, bent Avellano tree which I'm trying to save. So far, the truck just barely passes beneath it. When this part of the road gets gravel too, thight maneuvering will be required.
But the truck driver needed a place where to turn around the truck. I had to allow him leveling an area for that purpose. The area chosen had no large trees. The front loader had been sitting unused for some weeks, and grass was growing through its openings.
At this point, almost half of the road has gotten its gravel cover. But the soil is so soft that the heavy truck sinks in anyway. Here is a closeup of one truck trail. More gravel is still needed here.
And then it rained again, and I had to build levees and evacuation channels with my tiny camping shovel, while the roadbuilders had holidays...
Then the work continued, soon finishing the steepest part of the road. The look of this photo is a bit misleading! The slope on this stretch is 16%!
Those apples are from New Zealand? Thanks for playing! Eat local for Thanksgiving | All You Can Eat | Seattle Times
In keeping with today’s Thanksgiving theme, the nice folks at Puget Sound Fresh have urged me to urge you to join their “Eat Local for Thanksgiving” campaign. Consider yourself urged. So, what’s the deal? They want to raise awareness of the fab foodstuffs available from local farmers, ranchers, fisherfolk, cheesemongers, et al, hoping to ensure that each of you adds at least one locally grown or produced item to your holiday meal. Take the pledge (I did!) and maybe you’ll win one of five heritage turkeys or a year’s supply of organic milk — no small (fingerling) potatoes. Need a few hints about local foods you might use? How ’bout these apples from the University District Farmers Market, which I baked into a pie made with leaf lard bought from a local farmer and Stone-Buhr All-Purpose certified sustainable flour, grown and milled in the beautiful Pacific Northwest and available at area supermarkets:
There is a terrible lukewarmness about this time as prophesied, but what exactly does it look like? Rev 3:17 teaches that the main characteristic is a false perception of self. Many will claim the riches of Christ who will not claim their own poverty of spirit. They will make much noise about how they are Christ’s and will receive all His riches, yet they will not admit that they are wretched, miserable, poor, blind and naked. They may lukewarmly take the title of sinner, yet refuse to own all which that means. It means the nature which we possess despises God, it means not only do we have NOTHING good in who we are but we are nothing of which God consists, it means we are opposed to God to our very core, in short it means we are ENTIRELY ungodly.
Now God imparts His nature on top of those who He claims as His children, but these children recognize that this nature is not of themselves, it is God’s who will give to whomsoever He will. With this new nature imparted we can turn Godward, yet with our old nature remaining (the only one we are allowed to claim as us) we are to be constantly reminded we are wretched, miserable, poor, blind and naked. We are never to disown who we truly are, for doing so is the mark of lukewarmness. It is to be as the Pharisee who thanked God that he was not as other men are (Luke 18:11). This is why the drunkards and harlots will enter the kingdom of heaven before most who profess the name of Christ. They actually feel their own condition right to the core, they know who they are!
I see the corruptions in the world today, I see how far opposed to God the world is, and I look in my own heart and realize that I am exactly like other men are, and were it not for the restraining grace of God, their thoughts/words/deeds might be mine.
We may be granted ability to forsake gross outward sin, we may be granted restraining grace for a season to try us, for us to see where our hearts really are, but what do we see because of it? Has the eye salve been applied, that we may see that we are ENTIRELY ungodly? Or are we lukewarm in our perception of self?
Rev 3:17-18 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.

will be getting back to this when i get a chance, just wanted you to know i read it…my first thought is that the pharisee you keep refering to is not saved and does not the holy spirit in him…I say that bc i have consistently said that we agree on the face that the Lord does bring us to our ungodliness and yes, even after salvation we know who and what we truly are…there are lots of “but Gods” in Gods word…we are wretched and vile but God…..For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, teaching us that , denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly, righteously and godly in the present age looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and saviour Jesus Christ who gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from every from every lawless deed and purify for Himself His own special people zealous for good works, SPEAK these things exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you. Titus 2:11-15 (pretty close to the same thing in King James Version also) so we differ on the fact that the word of God says NOTHING about claiming to be ENTIRELY ungodly AFTER salvation…it speaks about being godly, That is all we are differing on, I say I am a complete wretched, vile sinner but you say you are entirely ungodly although scripture does not say that about you now. And of course the only way I can be anything BUT UNGODLY is by the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in me….we agree on the condition Lee, not the word…it seems as if you would deny the power of the Holy Spirit by claiming to be ENTIRELY anything..anyway, this is just my thoughts right now….
It comes down to this. Are you as other men are? Are you as the adulterer is? Are you as the unjust are? They are entirely ungodly. To say you are not as other men are (entirely ungodly), is to be the Pharisee. And yes, the Pharisee was not saved. That is why I keep telling you this is important, because it’s IMPORTANT.
Luke 18:10-12 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. 12 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.
As Christ is 100% God and 100% man so those who are regenerated in Christ are 100% ungodly and counted 100% godly at the same time. What remains of self is 100% ungodly, and what is of Christ in the believer is 100% godly, yet because it is of Christ it is not for the believer to claim it of himself, only rather that he is counted godly for Christ’s sake. The unbeliever is ONLY ungodly and has no possibility of being godly apart from the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit. Yet on the other side of this, the religionist will not admit to being ungodly, and thereby sets up a righteousness based in self. This is why Paul says so clearly that Christ only died only for the ungodly, specifically for those who see themselves as ungodly.
The unbeliever is ONLY ungodly and has no possibility of being godly apart from the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit.
I am ungodly apart form the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit with in me…the problem is YOU do not think the Holy Spirit resides in me….
before posting this I typed two paragraphs and then realized that it doesnt even matter what I SAY…you have me decided on what little you know about me…you are trying to get me to a place that the Lord Himself has brought me to and by His continuing grace , when I see myself for who and what i am He draws me to Him and the power of the cross to remind me that I am now HIS child, no longer condemned…I am in the battle paul descrribes, the one spurgeon preaches on, the one you experience daily…you have your beliefs based on your understanding of scripture and you see some things differently than i do…I read some about the Plymouth brethren and I get that you think all established churches are apostate or on there way and that you do not even come close to knowing me or what I do, think or say but the Lord does and that is what matters…I think you assume soem things about me like you have me figured out by judging me by a group but that isnt right and I do not now want to judge you by a group…..I read some on the plymouth brethren and I now I have some opinions and being the sinner that I am I could wrongly judge you based on my thoughts but I wont…..
When the Holy Spirit resides in a believer they know the difference between themselves and Christ in them. Like the publican they know that all they can claim for themselves is that they are ungodly, they understand that they are only counted godly for Christ’s sake.
Unlike the Pharisee, they understand that they themselves are as ungodly as the ungodliest of men are, and have put no difference between themselves and the ungodliest of men.
Luke 14:8-11 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him; 9 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room. 10 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee. 11 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
Laodicean Lordship would have you sit at a higher place, but Christ says take the lowest place, the place of the ungodly.
see, I do not exalt myself nor do I think more highly than I should, I have the holy spirit conviction of who I am…..I exalt Christ and only Christ. I am not going to try to convince you of me…this should only point thse who read it to Christ…The holy spirit is leading me…
For anyone that would be reading this, yes we our ungodly and need to put our trust and faith in Christ..He died for us while we were yet sinners….Lee and I agree on this and MANY other things that he may not even be aware of…
I am not understanding where in lordship man is exalted and Christ is not…but again, remember that I defended lordship to the point that I understand it and that has been explained at the original blog that converstaion comes from…I stated very clearly what I believe the teaching to say and that is what I see in scripture…I know the original 2nd post has been removed but i have made clear to the author of that blog, not to follow the man that she believes to be a false teacher (that may have been via email)..my point in the post was not to defend him or any other teacher but to correct the mistakes in her post, which were never addressed, and to warn her of calling someone a false teacher without being sure of what she spoke. I see that you do not like the teaching for what i am sure is a valid reason, the readers of that blog could benefit from you explaining why. The author of that blog is putting out things that are not true and therefore the arguing ensues…the mistakes are being focused on instead of what you see as the real issue.
I am reading the things you have sent and have been reading on the dual nature and single nature. I am not just sitting here trying to find things to back up what you assume my position to be….whether i have two naturse, one being ungodly one OR i have one nature with two principles, one being ungodly I do not understand…as spurgeon said, “Great is the mystery of godliness, the believer is a great riddle to those who observe him- he is discerned of no man”. He says that the christian is two men in one and he says THERE ARE IN ALL BELIEVERS TWO PRINCIPLES…..SERMON 1459B I know that holy spirit dwells in me and that I can be wrong about alot if not most things. The links you send and the things that the Lord leads me to when having this conversation with you just confirms in me that I DO believe as Paul and as Spurgeon and as Jeramiah Burrows, and John Newton…maybe I posted out of pride or a misplaced sense of defending the word of God…I felt led to correct Jean on the things she said…so that could have just been pride
I pray that you post a blog that would point out the exact ways that the lordship teaching is exalting man…i for one would read it and be in prayer about it. Again, I do not know all things and I do not presume to know all about lordhip other than what I find in scripture.
To be fair to the lady at the other blog, I may have used different phraseology, but she was spot on, and came to the conclusions on her own. She could even have used much stronger language and not been out of line with regards to the false teacher.
I came by to help in her defense because I knew she would be in for a large spiritual battle against those who professed to have been her friends.
The Spurgeon sermon gets close to the matter at hand and defines the battle, but doesn’t get down to drawing the lines of ownership.
and then of another law in his members warring against the law of his mind. The converted man is a new man in Christ
Jesus, but the old nature remains within him. The first life in a Christian, in order of time, is the old Adam nature. It is
there from the first. It is born of and with the flesh and it remains in us after we are born of the Spirit, for the second
“I believe it is a serious misunderstanding to think of the believer as having both an old and new nature. Believers do not have dual personalities…there is no such thing as an old nature in the believer”
“The biggest difficulty in believing that sin is a vanquished foe is the constant conflict believers have with sin. When you destroy people’s convenient theological categories by teaching what God really says–that there is only one nature in the believer–many don’t know how to respond”
“I’m not convinced there are two natures; I think you have one new nature that has the possibility of sinning”
The lesson to learn from the Pharisee and the Publican is, that if there is such a thing as an ungodly man (and we know that there is), then ‘thou art that man’. To deny it is to deny who we are, and to exalt ourselves over the publicans of the world. To talk about the ungodly as though it is just them is a horrible travesty, it is not just them, it is us.
Answers: Other than the first one, which makes Adam culpable (and were it not for him I would have done it), the answers for the rest are ‘me’
For me to make a claim on the divine nature as though it were actually me, is to rob Christ of it. Therefore though the second nature may be counted as mine by imputation, all I can truly own as me is the first nature. That nature is ENTIRELY ungodly.
In essence, Lordship salvation proponents make no allowance for those who have a battle with the an extremely difficult flesh. It has placed its primary focus on ‘sins’ (what you do) rather than ‘sin’ (who you are). It swings at the branches and misses the root.
I also realize that you are giving the understanding of this an honest go, and I give you much credit for that. Just keep going for it! It is a truth that will require your full reception of to proclaim to those in your own circle of acquaintance, and they will hate you for it….but it must be done.
ok, I am going to read what you posted, to be honest, no I havent read them AND as far as the other teacher, I have not read his writings on the nature of man either…just to let you know, and I mean this with all my heart, the ONLY reason I hate to say entirely anything is because it seems blashemous to deny what is in me EVEN though it is not me, I can say me, the” just me” is entirely ungodly, my flesh, i struggle to say that with the holy spirit in me I am entirely ungodly…does that make sense to you? Not that I am claiming any glory of the work He has done but just that a work HAS been done….let me read what you have posted and I will go back to the article that I read and go from there. I totally understand the pharisee and the publican and believe it or not the men that i listen to preach that passage just the way it should be…I was the pharisee and I thought I was going to heaven because I was a catholic but oh my poor sinner husband now he was a different story….I ended up in a worse spot than my husband ever could have been in (to the appearance of men) and drug down to the bottom of myself, in a way I never thought I would be and God did show me that I am sin and ungodly…I get the pharisee and the tax collector, what I do not get is the denying the change within me…maybe your not denying it but it just seems like it…I see it more as two saved sinners: one praying, forgive me Lord, thank you for the work on the cross, thank you for saving me, thank you for working in me and the other one saying Lord forgive me, rotten me, i am so terrible but NEVER getting to the thankfulness of salvation, not able to live out that salvation, not looking to the love of Christ and being so overjoyed and thankful that every time that sinner sees the rotteness they immediately go back to looking to Jesus and not themselves…tell me if this does not make sense to you….I will read it….
are you saying that to teach the single nature view is heretical? Is that why you would call Dr Macarthur a false teacher?
“I get the pharisee and the tax collector, what I do not get is the denying the change within me…maybe your not denying it but it just seems like it”
I am not asking you to deny any change within you, I am asking you to renounce ALL credit for it. I am asking you to realize that it truly is not you, it is ONLY and ENTIRELY Him, and that can only happen when you see yourself as ENTIRELY ungodly. If that makes sense?
Like I said earlier, I am a thousand miles from where I started, but I have a million miles to go. I didn’t stay where I was, but my flesh (who I am) has resisted the travel every step of the way. My Travel Agent is entirely responsible for bringing me thus far, and I can claim NOTHING of it for myself. That is the war in Romans 7!
“are you saying that to teach the single nature view is heretical? Is that why you would call Dr Macarthur a false teacher?”
He denied the eternal Sonship of Christ (since renounced) with no subsequent conversion. If the Spirit is not testifying to one of the right person of Christ (John 15:26), that means one is not saved. PERIOD! In the time when he denied the eternal Sonship of Christ he was lost. He records no subsequent conversion. No matter how much truth he may emit, he is still lost! Unfortunately those on the Lordship side are almost infatuated with him.
that does make sense and I thought I did make it clear that I take NO, ZERO, NONE credit for anything done in me, through me that is good…and that if this is what you meant by entirely ungodly then yes that is what I am….where I am right now, before checking into anything: I see that lordship to mean a principle at eh time of conversion not a practice lived out afterwards…like, when God saves you, you know He is Lord, you admit that He is all and you are nothing, you KNOW you are not the master and He is..you just see God and Christ for who and what they are…not this, oh yeah, i dont wanna go to hell let me have some Jesus…do YOU say people can have Jesus on their own terms? Not as He really is?
I cannot speak to statement you made about macarthur denying sonship as I have never heard that before…I just think if you call him a false teacher because he doesnt agree on the nature of man AFTER conversion then that would not be right…To be a false teacher you teach a false way to salvation and what we are discussing is man AFTER conversion not prior to conversion…God does the saving, He saves us without us knowing every detail of it…that is why I say in principle every man saved comes to Jesus as Lord even if they do not know it because He is Lord…but we do not change the fact that He is Lord in our speech to the unsaved because Christ didnt…ok, that is all I have for now, I do want to read some more and get back into scripture on this…
so who is the real me after conversion? the flesh or the spirit? If I am not to walk as the ungodly then why do I refer to “the real me” as the ungodly after conversion…wouldnt the “real me” that is living eternally with God and has been redeemed by the blood of His Son now the real me?
we totally agree on the real us before conversion but I am seeing the new man as being me…didnt Paul tell us to crucify the old man and walk as the new and cant that struggle take place without it seeming like we are taking any credit for that new man?
If Spurgeon explains it the way that he does which is how I was understanding and explaining it do you say that Spurgeon was not saved or that he is a false teacher? I want to be sure you arent saying that ANYONE that does not call it two distinct natures but maybe refers to it as did spurgeon, flesh/spirit, old man new man etc….are not saved? I do not mean Macarthur, I mean all the rest of christians that may not even have thgouht all this through?
There is not one text in the New Testament that teaches that regeneration is the implanting of a “new nature” beside the old, or, that the renewed man has two hostile natures. What he does have is two hostile principles in one nature.
But I see another law in my members, warring against my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members (Gal. 5:17). For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish (Rom. 7:23). Here the great apostle teaches that the renewed man (one man and one nature still) is imperfect having two principles of volition mixed in the motives of the same acts. Paul does not teach in these passages, or any other, that the renewed man becomes “two men.”
Good points of discussion. I am out for the rest of the day and will respond to the rest by tomorrow morning.
If you re-read the Spurgeon sermon you mentioned he does deal rightly in recognizing the Adam nature remaining until physical death.
and sanctified—but it is enmity against God and is not reconciled to God—neither, indeed, can be. The old nature is of
the earth, earthy, and must be crucified with Christ and buried with Him, for it is altogether too bad for mending! This
old nature lives in our members, that is to say, its nest is the body and it works through the body.”
“I see that lordship to mean a principle at the time of conversion not a practice lived out afterwards”
That is quite opposite of the definition of Lordship Salvation. LS is actually concerned with the practice lived out afterwards. It is not just a receiving of Christ as Lord, but is concerned with submission to Christ as Lord. As I wrote in my post on Husbandship, one can submit to a lord without loving him, and one can love a lord without submitting to him. LS is the equivalent of reformed popery, or reformed Islam.
No. Jesus is Jehovah, nothing changes that. Abraham saw Christ in Gen 17:1, it takes the Holy Spirit to enlighten a person to understand that (1 Cor 12:3), yet enlightenment does not mean conversion.
“To be a false teacher you teach a false way to salvation and what we are discussing is man AFTER conversion not prior to conversion”
A false teacher teaches either: a false perception of Christ and His work, or a false perception of self. Macarthur has failed on both accounts.
“that is why I say in principle every man saved comes to Jesus as Lord even if they do not know it because He is Lord”
The real you after conversion is the same you as before the conversion (you must own that you are just like other men). The difference is that something new has been imparted to you by another, and is COUNTED as you. This new thing in you is Him, otherwise you would have been worthy to open the book (Rev 5:2-4). If the new man was you, then you would be worthy to open the book, but as it is neither you nor I are worthy to open it.
The believer is never to take ANY credit for that new man in the struggle, that is rooted in pride which is precisely the LS route. If he were honest with himself he would see his pride as one of those very things he would be claiming to be putting to death.
If Spurgeon explains it the way that he does which is how I was understanding and explaining it do you say that Spurgeon was not saved or that he is a false teacher? I want to be sure you arent saying that ANYONE that does not call it two distinct natures but maybe refers to it as did spurgeon, flesh/spirit, old man new man etc….are not saved?
To say one has a sin nature is to say one has inherited it by natural lineal descent, for that is what a ‘nature’ is. When one can rightly renounce they were born the first time the natural way, then they can deny they have a sin nature. Only Christ could ever make that claim. To teach otherwise does indeed make one a false teacher. As quoted earlier, Spurgeon clearly understands the two natures residing in a believer, one by their first (natural) birth, and the other by their second (supernatural) birth.
“There is not one text in the New Testament that teaches that regeneration is the implanting of a “new nature” beside the old, or, that the renewed man has two hostile natures. What he does have is two hostile principles in one nature.
But I see another law in my members, warring against my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members (Gal. 5:17). For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish (Rom. 7:23). Here the great apostle teaches that the renewed man (one man and one nature still) is imperfect having two principles of volition mixed in the motives of the same acts. Paul does not teach in these passages, or any other, that the renewed man becomes “two men.””
To state this is be the Pharisee in Luke 18:11-12 mentioned earlier. Either one admits they are like other men who have a sin nature or they deny it as this Pharisee did. Man doesn’t lose his original sin nature until he loses his body to the grave. This nature was born naturally and must die naturally. To say that one has two principles residing in the new nature of their supernatural birth is blasphemy of the highest sort. It is to attribute this ‘hostile principle’ so-called, to the the supernatural birth brought forth of the Holy Spirit.
As I wrote in my post on Husbandship, one can submit to a lord without loving him, and one can love a lord without submitting to him. LS is the equivalent of reformed popery, or reformed Islam.
what about you love Him so you submit to Him…You DO submit because you are His and you respond to His lordship due to the simple fact that He is Lord
this is what Macarthur says about what he thought about Christ even during the time he was wrong about Sonship….I have never heard him teach of a man being anything other than a vile sinner, wretched from birth…..that is why I say he differs on his opinion of mans nature AFTER conversion….again he never teaches perfection and never dismisses the struggle of the flesh and the spirit
But that is just Macarthur…..I am talking about other preachers that I know would in essence agree with Lordship to the point of this: I quote: “what is faith?
It is more than a mental assent to the facts-not lordship facts not savior facts. It is a heartfelt coming to CHrist and resting in Him for what He is and what He offers. It is an act of the heart that no longer hates the light but comes to the light…lordship salvation is NOT-emphatically NOT-anything other than salvation by faith (true faith) in the LORD Jesus Christ”..
this is quoting a man that agrees with lordship so how can you say he means one thing when he says this? This is where you are throwing me…these people (not just macarthur) are flat out saying what they think lordship is and it is not what was represented on the previous blog…there are others i could quote but they say the same thing…they say you come to Christ as Lord because He is Lord…yes you are vile sinner, yes He is a Holy God and when He saves you, you will love Him because He first loved you, your life will be in accordance with scripture and yes, that includes sin…not perfection…not lack of sin, there is scripture that is in the word that speaks to knowing you are saved by this or that…the evidences…and that includes your love for Christ, your love for light and not darkness…
I understand that alot of preachers are concerned with the texts in scripture that is concerned with the practice lived out afterwards…
again, it seems that instead of saying that lordship teaches something that a whole lot of lordship proponents do not teach would it not serve the body to speak specifically to a person and his teaching instead of generalizing? you are putting people into a spot where you are the judge of what you think they mean when they speak….that sounds like a dangerous place to be in and that is why I am posting to you and posted to jean, not to argue a point but to say that you cannot say that people mean one thing when they say something else..
…here is what spurgeon says: If the professed convert distinctly and deliberatly declares that he knows the Lords will, but does not mean to attend to it, you are not to pamper his presumptions but it is your duty to assure him that he is not saved…..that is how I am understand ing lordship…you come to Christ as He is and your life will show it…thats all….i do not speak for a man but for me……..
as far as what i asked you to speak to up top, I was wondering if you could provide the scripture in the New Testament that speaks to the two men instead of one man, two laws (principles) that Paul speaks of….what I quoted was taken from the other side of the dual nature theory…i get the old man new man, crucify the old man, NEW creature created in Christ…..seem to sound like me and spurgeonm saying it all…
to absolutely teach the nature of fallen man before a holy God…they do not teach salvation by works…they teach Christ in His fullness leaving out nothing…they teach a saving gospel……..
.I have heard all kinds and I am well aware that they are out there…in abundance…matter of fact its hard to find the one preaching the truth…but where I am they still exist…..we have to be cautious and stay in scripture and follow the Lord…i do not assume they are right in all that they say…they are sinful men as are we….they are fallible….
of course I am as all men, sinful…of course I have hope that lost men do not, I strive to not walk as the gentiles walk, I walk in the light as scripture commands
And you, who were once estranged and hostile in mind doing evil deeds He has now reconciled in His body of flesh by His own death, in oreder to present you holy and blameless and irreproachable before Him provided
that you continue in the faith stable and steadfast not shifting from the hope of the gospel, which you heard, which has been preached to every creature under heaven, and of which I , Paul, became a minister Col1:21-23
forgot my scripture references: if anyone loves me he will keep my word and my father wil love him and we will come to him and make our abode with him John 14:23
and why do you call me Lord Lord and do not do what I say ? Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and acts upon them I will show you whom he is like …..Luke 6:46
As ‘submit’ is currently defined by LS advocates you have to write Solomon out of heaven, David out of heaven, the smoking Spurgeon out of Heaven, the fat Moody out of heaven, the list gets pretty long….
These men did not submit to the will of God when they overate, smoked, killed, and idolized, yet they loved God and each of these men are His. The LS interpretation of Matt 7:21 would have them cast out of heaven, but we do believe these men are children of God, therefore the will of God must be something different than that proposed by LS advocates.
“The “incarnational sonship” view, while admittedly a minority opinion, is by no means rank heresy.”
It is always fascinating to watch a heretic justify his heresy as ‘not so bad’. Almost akin to asking Hitler’s opinion of his eugenics program.
Nevertheless instead of just saying he was wrong, and denouncing the heresy properly, he goes into how Augustine was so humble in reconsidering his own ‘little errors’ attempting to attribute that humility to himself. He just never gets any better…. The Devil has his counterfeits for nearly every grace of God, the only one he has not been able to counterfeit closely is humility.
Theologically speaking, by denying the two natures in man Macarthur attributes man’s sin after regeneration to the Holy Spirit instead of to man. To propose that there is something in man’s new nature that sins…. thereby attributes that sin to the nature put forth of the Holy Spirit in the second birth. Your nature is that which you are born with, the first nature comes by natural birth, the second nature by spiritual birth.
Ask your husband if he is in the habit of inviting people he considers dangerous wolves into his church? Tell him if he is ever going to be a good wolf hunter he can’t do that. The least he can do if he is going to be a good wolf hunter is to exercise a bit of discernment and not invite those he considers dangerous/persuasive wolves into his church. That is why it would be pretty scary to attend there, who knows who else he has invited?
Lordship looks to a formality and morality that can be accomplished through legalism as its ‘evidence’ so-called of salvation. The problem is that the ability to accomplish these things is also possible for the unbeliever, thereby annulling this as an evidence to be looked for.
An excellent example of the moral ascetic was Jonathan Edwards. If you read his resolutions you found he had very high aims, yet for something so base as the sake of vanity he shaved his head and wore a wig to fit in with the bigwigs.
He is a brother in Christ, but moral asceticism of his resident sin nature often got the better of him, which the Lord made manifest in his vanity.
submit as defined in Strongs concordance when used in James in reference to “submit to God” is to rank or place under, put in subjection…ie we are to submit to one another, wives submit to your husbands, submit to God, its scriptural to submit……
i would say it is just responding to the truth of who Christ is…I am not sure how you say LS advocates define it and I know there are extremes in LS just as in anything else and it may be those of
whom you speak…it seems that you say LS teaches lack of sin as an evidence of being saved, possibly, I do not speak for them all but I know the men I listen to teach evidences such as looking to Christ, loving Christ, desiring Christ …let me quote “love for God
, repentance from sin, genuine humility, devotion to Gods glory, continual prayer, selfless love, seperation from the world, spiritual growth, obedient living (Matt 7:21, Jn 15:14, Rom 16:26, 1 Peter 1:2, 1john 2:3-5) just to note, this DOES NOT say perfect obedience nor does it say no sinning, I know the last time I quoted something like this by someone else you disagreed so I thought I should put scripture…
, hunger for Gods word, transformation of life…with scripture references listed along side of each…what I am saying is that it is not all focused on manifestation of sin in your life…it focuses on your entire life…yes, David sinned grieviously but Davids life was lived with a love for God and with sorrow and repentance and with humility and a regard to do what was right in the sight of God….
…..like I said, there are those that are legalistic as well as those who are antinomion but they do not represent all who do or do not believe in LS….I get that you are speaking to a certain group..
if anyone loves me he will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come to him and make our abode with him John 14:23
what I see in scripture: Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks for this is Gods will for you in Christ Jesus…1Thess 5:16-18
Now, as to your next post about my husband, thank you for answering his question, he has graciously allowed me to have this conversation with you, against his better judgement, no doubt but I will say that we invite all to the church building, not all preach teach and serve but all are invited to come hear the word of God, and no this is not what my husbands response to you would have been, these are my words…I cannot hear your tone in your post so I may have taken that the wrong way…I certainly didnt feel love, humility or peace when I read it but I could be wrong…I spoke to the evidence earlier, I know some preach about evidence of blatant ongoing unrepentant sin as being a need to examine yourself in the light of scripture because scripture says that…I know they also preach the glory of God the Love of Christ, the love of others the fruit of the spirit, they preach it all not just sin manifestations…I have enjoyed our conversation and it has given me alot to ponder and I see a need to be careful about coming down too heavy on one issue above another…I know that if something is being percieved in a negative way then it must be examined in the light of scripture….as far as our original post on the dual nature I will continue my study as it is something i never even gave a second thought…I wish you peace and joy in your walk with the Lord….
The conversation was good. As you check the two natures of the Christian and come to a greater understanding of it, the LS stuff will fall by the wayside.
A bland and neutral definition of the term which is actually a relatively new invention being only 50 years old.
PS: The Lord has made many opportunities for me to preach in the church foyer or parking lot, that is why your husband ought not invite those of us he considers dangerous/persuasive types into his church. We are dangerous to the status quo in religion and the persuasiveness which comes only by Holy Spirit works equally well in bathroom or the pulpit.
Lee, AMEN and AMEN! May the Lord bless you brother in your walk. This blog and your website is one of the few genuine sites I have come accross on the web.
Only those who are truly owned by Christ see themselves as the rest of the world. I am just like my unsaved next door neighbour. I am just like my athiest friend. I am in no way better than her in thought, word or deed. I am entirely ungodly today.
It is only pride that can make us think we are any better than anyone else! I used to have that pride, even after I was saved. This is why I so agree with you when you say
“We may be granted ability to forsake gross outward sin, we may be granted restraining grace for a season to try us, for us to see where our hearts really are, but what do we see because of it? Has the eye salve been applied, that we may see that we are ENTIRELY ungodly? Or are we lukewarm in our perception of self?”
Many who proffess Christ with much zeal are blind to this truth! As you say trust Christ and leave the rest to Him. Amen. Thats all we can do, learn from Him and take His yoke, so many times we are so heavy laden by the yoke of legalism, but if only we trust Him.
Those who shout you cant be truly saved if you cant submit to Christ as Lord and all the rest of it, its just that they desire slavery to freedom. They desire to be in bondage, they know not the grace of God. Therefor they despise and mock those who are sons, the true Bride Of Christ, that is neither of the Lordship Camp or of Easy Believism Camp. They are the Bride Of Christ!
The aposle Paul clearly describes this battle in Romans 7:15-25. Even though we have been given a new (divine) nature upon receiving salvation, every christian still has to fight the flesh (sin nature) that resides in us. The everyday battles that we face when our flesh wars against our spirit should bear witness with our spirit that we are not better than anyone else, and that apart from the grace of God, there would be absolutely nothing godly about us.

Soohong fainted. Our money ran out. Committing genocide is one of the biggest crimes against humanity. I asked them to call you.
I'm pressing charges. They may be poor, but rich in spirit. This was one of the best days of my life. My grandma and my mom used to say this all the time. I didn't know Bradford and Nichael were related. The clothes are there. The file must be ready for tomorrow. To scream at the top of your lungs. Sometimes they say, "I can't go to school today. I'll go tomorrow." Indra was told he would never amount to anything, and he was desperate to prove them wrong.
Sue thinks he knows where to find Hilda. We had a rest in the shade. We must look after her children this evening. Charles reluctantly followed Kirk. Do you need any food? You can't leave. Why don't you start?
Lorien forgot all about them. Does Shirley have a computer? You've got better things to do. Tell her what you mean. Let's get in touch in another day or two. Cary isn't asking any questions.

My grandparents had a farm in Africa at the edge of the Indian Ocean. It was in Mtwara, Tanzania --- right on the sea-shore, I am told. This faded photograph shows my grandfather with the carcass of a lioness that had been caught trespassing. Here's one that shows my grandmother sitting, uncomfortably and in a sari, on the same lioness. I'm guessing the posing with the lioness was my grandfather's idea.
I like these old photographs as they show my grandparents in a time and place and in circumstances that I am not used to seeing them. My grandfather looking dapper in a white suit and various interesting hats, my grandmother at a "sundowner" (I don't remember ever seeing alcohol in my grandparents house in Kerala), my grandfather on a motorbike, with the rest of his soccer team (who seem to have had a penchant for interesting headgear). And then there's this adorable (and nicely framed) picture of my mother and her two siblings:
I'm in awe of my grandfather's spirit of adventure and perseverence that would take him, a high-school graduate, from the village of Kumbanad in Kerala to running a successful agricultural business in a far away land. It appears that Kumbanad, a village that I have visited precisely once in my life, has had an especially strong culture of emigration. This Outlook magazine article talks of how the village today is made up of old people whose children and grandchildren are in foreign countries.
At the time the first step to finding a job overseas was to go to Bombay. Not long after graduating from high-school he did exactly that. It was in his office in Bombay that he met my grandmother (as I was surprised to find out, knowing how involved he was in his children's marital decisions). While in Bombay, after several attempts, he found a job with a company in East Africa.
My grandparents' time in Africa, especially after the birth of their children, is quite well-documented in several photo albums. When I was at home recently I scanned in the oldest of those albums: faded pictures and all. It appears that his first appointment was in the Hasani Estates in Makanya (near the Tanga Railway Line), in the north of the country near the border with the Kenya. After a couple of years there they moved down to Mikindani in the south (near the Mozambique border) where my grandfather worked at the sisal estates. Sisal is a kind of plant fiber used for making rope. The Mikindani Sisal estate appears to be owned today by the same family that owned it then --- the Karimjee/Jivanjees. Here's a quote from a now-dead web-page that was cached by google :
Karimjee Jivanjee Estates Ltd was founded in 1939 to look after agricultural interests. The firm consisted of fifteen plantations growing sisal, coffee, coconuts, kapok, rubber, timber and fruits.
However acquisition of estates had commenced in 1921 with the purchase of Derema Coffee Estate in the Usambara Mountains. Derema is the oldest recorded estate in Tanganyika being formed in 1891 by the German East Africa Co. Production on Derema was changed from coffee to tea in 1933 following the damage inflicted by coffee berry disease and the 194o's saw the addition of Monga and Maramba Tea Estates in the Amani Forest.
Sisal estate acquisitions commenced in 1922 but the company's original Mtwara sisal estate was acquired by the British Government in order to create Mtwara township and harbour.
Karimjee Jivanjee Estates reached its peak in the early 1960's with sisal production at 12,500 tons per annum and tea production at 550 tons per annum.
In 1956, less than a decade after he got to Africa, my grandfather branched out on his own; starting his own estate in Mtwara (close to Mikindani) with cattle, poultry and cashews.
Tanzania has had a particularly comopolitan history because of its indian-ocean coast. Starting as early as the 8th century, Arabs, Persians, Indians, Chinese (possibly this guy?), Portuguese, Germans and Brits played a role. The Sultan of Oman controlled Zanzibar and the Tanganyikan coast from atleast the 18th century. The Germans started colonizing the area in the 1880s, and the Brits took over after WWI. The Germans built railway lines and introduced Sisal.
There have been Indians in East Africa for centuries. The Karimjee-Jivanjee family got to Tanzania in the 1830s (!). I'm not sure exactly why so many people from one particular part of India (Gujurat/Cutch) moved to East Africa over the past couple of centuries. Names that end in jee: Karimjee, Vassanji, Verjee, Nagji, Tyabji, Bhanji are all from a particular ethnic/religious group --- the Bohra/Ismailis of eastern India.
When I was an undergraduate in Texas, I was sitting at lunch one day with a kid of Indian-East-African origin (with a -ji last name). And we found out, to our astonishment, that his family came from Mtwara --- the same small town that my grandparents built their estate in.
My mother's Tanzanian past caught up with her when she worked in Oman for a short while in the 90s. As the Sultan Of Oman ruled Zanzibar until the 1960s, Oman has several citizens of Zanzibari origin who speak Kiswahili (rather than Arabic). So my mother was able to understand what her colleagues were saying even when they thought she didn't (though she owned up shortly).
When we were kids in Kerala my grandparents used to speak to each other in Kiswahili when they didn't want us to understand. And my aunt and my mom, though much less fluent, try that occassionally even today.
Unlike these other East-African Sepia Mutiny commenters, I can't claim much more of a legacy from my grandparents' east-african sojourn. They moved back to Kerala around 1970. Here's a set of some of their pictures.
This is an MRI image of my heart. My friend who works on MRI imaging needed real data of a beating heart so I volunteered. Now my heart gets to be displayed in a paper. With a little luck, maybe one day it'll be as ubiquitous as the picture of this lady.
Being in an MRI machine is an interesting experience. Perhaps not so enjoyable if you're claustrophobic or if you're really ill.

Yesterday I visited the first Christmas Bazaar of the month where I bought some handcrafted holiday decor and indulged in a cheese raclette especially imported from Switzerland; a tradition me and my Austrian/German expat friends enjoy once every year and really look forward to. This event also never fails to officially trigger my Christmas countdown mood for it means that my annual holiday back home with my family is very close. Only two more weeks and I'm back in good old Austria!
My joy is usually followed by a shocking realization that I still haven't organized all the Christmas presents on my list - I'm really not the person who thinks about this kind of stuff in July. So, if you are - congratulations! Any tips for me?
Well, I'm sure there are some of you who are as "ad-hoc" as me when it comes to Christmas gifts for all your dear ones. And who also favor handmade presents from the heart over mainstream, commercial and boring things that nobody really needs. Right?
So, I thought I'd do a series of DIY Christmas gift ideas that are very easy, beautiful and useful at the same time. The kind of gifts that give a warm feeling both to the giver and the receiver. One of my favorite personal gifts is a delicious handmade sugar scrub because you need very little ingredients and yet the outcome is just fantastic. Instead of posting a step-by-step DIY here on my blog, I scoured the web to compile a selection of my personal favorites for you. Enjoy no. 1 of my series and have a happy first advent!
Welcome to my wellness blog! This is my little "boutique" where I curate & create things for blissful living. My main ingredients for wellbeing: spa, yoga, aromatherapy and retreats in Asia - thanks for visiting!

Email is a shrewd choice when it comes to marketing your business. If you’re thinking about getting into e-mail marketing then use all of the tips in this article to help you get started today.
TIP! Email only the people on your list. If you mail those that are not familiar with you, your emails will be taken as spam.
Do not ever send unsolicited emails to unsuspecting customers. When you send out your emails to everyone, many people will mark them as spam. Not only is this bad for your reputation, but some ISPs might block your IP address if too many people complain that you are sending unsolicited marketing messages.
Don’t email people that you do not know. When you do a mass mailing to random recipients, they are often received in a spam filter. This type of random emailing can just cause a person to question whether they know you or your company, and they probably will end up caring less about your company if they run across it in the future. This can result in them deleting your email, which would mean your time was wasted.
TIP! Always proofread emails that you send. It is important that all the emails you send are correct.
Tailor your message to your audience. Encourage your subscribers to invite their friends to join your list too. At the end of every email, provide a “subscribe” button and a “share” button so readers can pass along your information to friends. Your subscription list will automatically grow as more people who are interested in your business sign up.
Create one clear message per email. You don’t want your consumers to be overwhelmed or bored by the content in your email. Build one clear, concise point for each email. Your customers will be happy that they’re not being bombarded with too much information.
TIP! Make sure you include limited promotions and special offers in your newsletters; this will keep your customers interested and always on the lookout for future emails. Using email marketing in this way will give customers a return on their time for reading your emails and will most likely gain you referrals as well.
Never use the cliche phrases in your marketing. Specifically avoid the “Buy now! Don’t use that approach. This is not a good way to go about doing this and you may be considered a spammer. Instead, focus on building a solid relationships through informative or useful content your readers will enjoy. They’ll appreciate this and will most likely buy from you.
Consistency is important. Make sure to be consistent with your colors and branding in your emails. Use a legible, easy to read font. By doing this, you begin to create brand recognition, and customers will look forward to your next message. In marketing with email, familiarity is very, very important.
TIP! Use A/B testing strategies when sending emails. Take one email and choose two different subject lines for that email.
Make sure you only email subscribers who give you permission to do so. If you fire off unsolicited emails, the recipients are not likely to take you seriously. Many customer are put off by receiving spam and it may hamper your relationship with your customer.
Limit your email communications to once a week. Chances are, your customers receive a ton of email everyday, just like you. If you send too many messages, you will just become part of the clutter. They may begin skipping them, or worse, deleting them without ever reading!
TIP! Try different email formats. The most urgent information and the newest offers should generally appear near the top of the message.
Branding your business is essential, and should be incorporated in your marketing emails. For this reason, it is worth designing a template that contains your logo, standard color scheme, and fonts that appear in your other marketing materials, such as your website. This brand recognition will create a more professional appearance.
Ask your customers for expressed permission if you want to send them email messages. If you fail to do this, you will destroy the trust of your existing customers and generate negative word of mouth. Some ISPs may even blacklist your emails, ensuring that your marketing campaigns fail and your profits diminish.
Enhance your campaigns in email marketing with both passive and active feedback. Active feedback is simply asking your readers for opinions and other suggestions they might have. You should also use passive feedback, which is more subtle. Utilize software programs or tools to evaluate what links are used most frequently.
TIP! Branding your business is essential, and should be incorporated in your marketing emails. Design an email template that incorporates elements from your site.
Hopefully, you’ve found more than a few promising ideas and novel strategies for email marketing in this article. Feel free to review this article at your convenience, or bookmark it for later reference. By making use of its advice, you will likely be able to improve the quality of any email marketing efforts you undertake.
Are you trying to use e-mail marketing, but aren’t getting the results that you want? Does the concept of marketing with email interest you, but leave you unsure of where to start? This article can answer your questions. In the paragraphs below, you’ll find advice for mass appeal e-mail marketing strategies.
TIP! If you plan to tackle email marketing, you need to know you have to have the permission from all those you wish to include on your email list. If you do not get their permission, you will get a lot of spam complaints and perhaps lose customers all together.
Be sure that you’re not sending out marketing emails that are unsolicited. If you are emailing people who don’t wish to be on your mailing list, they will most likely delete your emails. In addition to having a negative effect on your reputation, this could also cause ISPs to block you.
Do your best to keep your email message personal. Consumers feel like they can relate to a business that treats them in a personal nature, this makes them more inclined to purchase items. For example, if you are aware of the reasons for them signing up with your emails, add that reason in an email to them.
TIP! Limit your message to one clear one per email. Do not let your customers get annoyed or bored by your content.
Be certain you send correspondence only to those eager to receive it. Mailing messages to individuals with whom you are unacquainted will make you look like a spammer. They’ll wonder whether they are interesting in what you are selling or not. This most likely will lead them to throw your email in the trash, which in turn just wasted your efforts.
Use gentle marketing language, not the “Hurry up and buy! ” strategy. This is a very repeatitive way to go about things and you may be considered a spammer and lose a lot of customers. They are aware that you want to increase sales, so it would be best if you built a solid, professional relationship with them before encouraging them to buy anything. Your customers will appreciate being treated well and will return the favor by buying from you again.
TIP! Before you send out emails, make sure to proofread them. Correct any emails or newsletter problems you may have.
Test out variations of what you want to use on your subject line by using A/B testing. Choose one email, randomly split the mailing list in two and send each half the same email with different subject lines. Doing so will help you determine which type of subject line helps get your emails opened, and which kind will get them deleted.
Proper branding of your business includes a good marketing with email strategy. That is why you must take time to build a great template that includes all of your sites primary features. Doing so can help your readers to recognize your company instantly.
Try to enhance your campaigns for e-mail marketing with not just active feedback, but passive feedback, as well. Active feedback is that feedback that you receive directly from questions or comments provided by your customers. Passive feedback is generally invisible to your reader and more subtle. You can utilize any tools and other software that you have in order to figure out which links are receiving the most clicks.
TIP! When researching email marketing, use as many resources as possible. There are lots of great online books or even ones in libraries.
Change the format of your emails from time to time. For example, use plain text if you usually use HTML and vice versa. When done judiciously, it can make your customers feel a personal connection to you and your products.
Use pre-header material to enhance the preview of your emails. Use a preheader, it is a highlighted piece of text at the top of your email. A lot of email clients will put this after the subject line of your email; this will grab the attention of your customers.
TIP! Always get permission before contacting any customer via email. People typically think of emails that aren’t desired by them as spam.
Be certain that email marketing initiatives allow for recipients to opt out of further participation. Email messages can cost money, though not very much. You do not want your business to be considered in a negative way or to have your email address put on blacklistings.
TIP! Keep in mind that the ultimate goal with email marketing is to get your product sold. With that in mind, each email needs to be crafted to entice the reader to buy.
Email marketing is a great way to build your business, but only when you know what you’re doing. Thanks to the text you just read, you now know what it takes to use marketing via email to your benefit. Simply apply the tips above to see results with email marketing.
How often do you check your email? Most people tend to check their email a few times a day. Email is a great way to reach your audience. These are just a couple tips that will help you be successful with email marketing.
TIP! Use gentle marketing language, not the “Hurry up and buy! This is not a very effective approach. These kinds of approaches are overused, and can give your emails a spam-like feel.
Try not to overuse urgent language and phrases such as “Hurry!” or “Purchase immediately!” NA Customers may be put off by what appears to be “spam” at first glance. Instead, build a relationship with your customers and stay professional. Customers really do notice things like this and will be more likely trust you and your business.
Include special offers and promotions available only to recipients of your emails. This form of email promoting not only gives your readers a real value for their participation, but also encourages them to refer friends. Consider giving even greater discounts to those readers who do refer new customers.
TIP! Proofread anything you send out via email. All correspondence should be completely coherent and error-free.
Always obtain permission before you contact your customers via email. When people receive unwanted emails, they consider them to be spam which they ignore or delete. Recipients never even glance at their contents. Your ISP may take action against you as well because sending out lot of emails can be seen as spamming, which may be against their policies.
Do not send email to anyone who has not given you permission to do so. Anyone who spams in any format will instantly receive a negative reputation. Most people will not only delete the email, but also resolve to never do business with you in the future.
TIP! Be consistent. Keep your company’s logo and the colors and style you use the same in every email.
Emails that contain only boring marketing and sales copy are mush less likely to be read than those that also include useful information. Make sure that your subscribers receive special articles that are only available via email. Promote special offers on products and services in your emails that are exclusive to your email customer. Send greetings for holidays or a personalized message for birthdays for instance.
Try to send only one email campaign message each week. Your customers often will get several messages a day and are very busy in their lives. Over time, they will start to “tune out” your email messages if they see them too frequently, wasting all of your efforts.
Email promoting is a clever way to stay in touch with your clients and customers. Take the information you have learned here and apply it to your own marketing with email campaigns to help you achieve positive results. It’s pretty simple to promote your business when you use an effective email promoting campaign.
Marketing via email is one of the most effective methods of advertising today. To get started with e-mail marketing today, there are so many things you can do to get started.
TIP! Focus on your target market. As you increase your readership, encourage your subscribers to have their friends opt-in to receive your emails, too.
Only make one clear message for each email you send. You don’t want bored customers or ones who are overwhelmed by too much content from your newsletter. Develop one key message and ensure it’s short and brief. Your customers will respond more positively to a message that is easily understood and goes straight to the point.
Promote special offers or limited time sales exclusively through email as a way of fostering excitement in your customers to be receiving your emails. E-mail marketing makes your readers feel more valued, as well as encourages them to invite friends. Additionally, having a referral rewards program will help you grow your customer and email base.
TIP! Keep your emails consistent. Make sure to be consistent with your colors and branding in your emails.
Try different email formats until you find what works best for you and your readers. Always place new offers and the most vital information at the top of the emails you send. Try out different approaches to see what gives you the best reaction. Once you know which ones will work and which ones won’t, keep doing the successful ones! Your customers will be more comfortable with something that is useful and familiar to them.
Only send email to customers after they have agreed to receive your mailings. Most people are inclined to ignore or delete messages from unknown senders and your efforts will be wasted. It may violate the policies of your ISP if you do mass emailings to people who have not asked to receive your emails.

This can be done in a few different ways, including providing information on new product launches, revealing new ways to use existing products, or offering discounts on popular products.

TIP! Use passive and active feedback to enhance email marketing efforts. Active feedback is obvious: ask for suggestions and opinions from your readers.

Mid 1990's me ** y***s o*d coming off a major surgery. Father bought me a porn mag with Lisa Ann as cover girl. Still she gets me off now just as she did then..woman is timeless. Love her.
The amount of work that has gone into it was quite ridiculous but it's cool to see that it's so well received!
Yes nice ass and I too would like to have seen her face, after all you look at it morein conversation befor, during and after & en between.
There's not enough lingerie videos on avatar-awards.eu. Thanks for doing the community a great service!
Some of the best parts were cut out...wanted to see her slowly slide her tits out of her bikini top and slowly show off her pussy. But it goes from bikini to pretty much naked!
At least, I’m calling it a heatwave. Though I can remember when I first moved to the city and suffered through almost all of October at unseasonably warm temperatures. Here’s hoping we’re almost at the end. Today is the first official day of Autumn, so I guess I have to get going on a fall playlist, too!
Summer’s End is a collection of some of my favorite stuff designed to sound like it’s from 1986, but was really made this year. Some of it is more thoughtful than the rest, but it’s all good nostalgia generation, and totally perfect for running around New York in short shorts and sunglasses in the late afternoon. That time of day when the heat radiating back up from all the concrete and out of the subway grates is almost worse than the hot summer air itself.
Spotify is pretty prickly about how it will play it, so I’m real open to other suggestions if you’ve got em. Otherwise, enjoy, and feel free to subscribe for my fall playlist (whenever that happens to get posted. Likely mid-winter at this rate).
[…] up some stuff while I was away, so I’ve got an interview with an XTube star coming up soon, a brand new end of summer playlist that I just posted last night, and a new (and retitled) 5 For the Weekend that will go up in a few […]
Hi! I'm Tyler. I'm a writer, elite companion, and general penis enthusiast. I'm so glad you found your way here! This blog is a collection of thoughts about male sexuality, pornography, and sexual health. You can find out more about me here.
This blog has a TON of super adulty stuff in it. You gotta be 18+ and into that (or at least be working on an incognito tab, bro).

Lan shook his head sightly. 'He was better. But he thought I was finished, with only one arm. He never understood. You surrender after you're dead.'
Simple zone that is done for Trials Stone and for Trans questing. First thing you do is wait to 9 o'clock pm mud TIME, to check just type TIME, then of course be in the zone in question.
Right near the western entrance to this zone is an in where a guy will ask you to play dice with him, go up into the rooms and do two things
2) In the room to the south you will find a book, just take everthing from said book and head to the central courtyard with the fountain
OK First thing from here is to go to the southern tower and open the door with the key you found. Follow the path upward and get the brass key that lies there on the ground.
Then go back to the fountain and go to the north tower. The key you got should open the door then press upward. Use your friend to remove the trap from the door by simply speaking TRAP. Then have him enter the door by speaking ENTER. The next step is to tell the thief to PICK and he will unlock the door north. I usually go back south from this point to make sure that my thief is safe, but i bet you dont have to. Kill the zombie and loot the rapier.
Take your thief back to the south tower and go back to where you found the brass key. Rinse repeat with the door and lock door in the portal. Just put the rapier in corpse to finish your little quest. The ghost will drop a key be sure you pick that up :P
Once you are back at the fountain go up untill you find a switch can't remember if you need to remove trap on the switch or not but unlock and open it to release an imp. Kill and loot key and head for the graveyard south-east-ish of square. Enter the the blue portal and follow the path downward. Find the beast on the way and kill for its key.
Next Find Zaalgies and his imp along the path downward. He isn't terribly hard but for newbies i wouldnt recomend it highly. He loads a few semi-useful items and above all the hexstone for trials.

Demi has been in love with her older brother's best friend Royal since she can remember. But at 18 he leaves her family and her father forbids her from ever contacting him again. He's gone.
7 years later Royal turns up on Demi's doorstep as she holds vigil by her fiancé's hopsital bedside as he lies in a coma. But her fiancé had broken up with her before he crashed and now Demi feels she must stay by him. Even more reason to stay away from Royal... especially as she can't afford to be heartbroken again. But Royal is not going to walk away so easily this time.
This took me over a week to read at a time where I didn't have a lot going on... and for me, that's a long time.
Angst: There was a great amount of angst in this and I presume the purpose was to build suspense and propel the plot but I got so wound up and frustrated. If Royal and Demi could just stop for 2 seconds and just TALK about things instead of shutting down and jumping to conclusions and making promises and gestures but never acting on it... good grief! It was exhausting.
Demi: Half the time I feel for her, other half I want to shake her up. She was stuck in a tough spot knowing Brooks had cheated on her and left her but no one else knowing she she had to stay by him for appearance's sake. But it was all going to come out anyway re the credit cards and the reported being pregnant and Demi planning on setting her lawyer father after her so why even bother keeping up the act!? Nevermind she was terrible at it, walking out of his charity event and allowing Royal to park his car - overnight - at her house! Just cut the damn strings and grow a pair!
Royal: So I liked him... sort of. I guessed in some way why he had gone away for 7 years and wasn't far wrong. But I didn't like how he shied away from just being honest to Demi. He deserved for Pandora to go and tell Demi before he did. He wanted the best of both worlds - to walk back into Demi's life with NO explanation - "yet" - but immediately pick up where they left off...
Story: It was focused a lot on Royal trying to win back Demi but I skim read a lot of it. There was drama involving Brooks and his affair and manipulation of Demi. For a book with a lot of dialogue there was very little said and I lost interest quite quickly. Neither Demi or Royal were willing to discuss actual issues or their situations - but they were willing to rekindle their long lost relationship physically while Demi delved into a battle of if she could trust him or not...
This just wasn't for me. There was too much unsaid and it caused immense frustration and annoyance beyond the usual tension level.
There have been so many books that I've loved prior to this blog so I thought it a good idea to start posting my favourites across di...
I am well aware how difficult it is to make a film, put on a stage play, create a television show, write a novel, let alone make something of note. (That appreciation doesn’t stop me from having high standards though.)

Meru tells the story of three men - Conrad Anker, Renan Ozturk, & co-director Jimmy Chin - as they attempt to reach the summit of Mount Meru, one of the most dangerous peaks of the Himalayan Mountains.
This is one of those documentaries that is great because of content instead of form. The at home shots are very cliche, with tracking shots done with DSLRs on sliders abound. The great thing about this movie technically is how much footage was shot. Extraneous conversations, accidents completely separate from the Meru climb, * climbs made a decade before Meru are all fully documented for thee talking heads to refer to. The climbs are also a sight to behold.
But this isn't a movie people watch for the technical aspects anyway. This is about the human spirit. This is a film about three men doing everything in their power to overcome the dangers of their craft to achieve their goal. And it's one of the most inspiring documentaries I've ever seen.
An absolutely stunning documentary about the expedition undertaken by a tight crew of three mountain climbers attempting to reach the top of the notoriously dangerous Mount Meru (while filming the whole thing!), how MERU didn't snag an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary is beyond me. It is thrilling, gripping, emotionally powerful, visually spectacular, and it certainly doesn't wear out its welcome at a swift 90 minutes.
It makes me angry that I saw the lame, forgettable EVEREST on a big screen last year, and not this instead.
Okay but I can’t even get to the second step of the attic ladder without my fear of heights kicking in

Yes, it's true!! Flat Stanley visited us here at the Amherst Town Library, along with his friend Emily. He even sat in on our Jr. Book Club meeting--didn't have a lot to say, but he was a very good listener!
Here are our Jr. Book Club members, working hard on their contributions to our handbook, "Perilous Pitfalls, and How to Avoid Them" inspired by our discussion of the book Roxie and the Hooligans by Phyllis Naylor. We came up with some great ideas!
Madame Thenin leads a group in a celebration of all things French--the kids learned to sing French songs, say some French words, and even made a special craft--tres bien!!!
Some of our Jr. Book Club members are showing off our beautiful, newly-covered pillows--thanks to Amy Littlefield, who did all the work!!

How To Introduce Music To Children: Early childhood learning principles and methods (EduMusica - music education for children Book 1)
Early childhood learning is extremely important for later development. Music is the universal language and is also deeply connected with emotions. This is why quality introduction to music in early childhood is very important.
The book describes principles and proven methods of how to introduce music to children. This approach is focused on children, which are 3 to 6 years old, and do not play an instrument yet. However, their musical skills are developed in an optimal way in order to allow them to play any instrument after the completion of this music introduction training.
The book describes the basic learning proces, as well as methods how to develop the child's voice, the sense of rhythm and melody, and also motoric skills.
This book is inteded primarily for kindergarten educators, which can improve their musical activities in the classes. However, also parents can find a lot of useful information regarding how to implement the pricniples of early childhood learning. The learning process should be done through play, through various musical activities, which develop certain musical skills. You will find descriptions of such musical activities, along with suggested instruments you should use (bells, claves, whistles, drums, etc.). It will help you to conduct musical classes in kindergartens, or have fun while developing your child's potential.
The book tries to be concise, giving short and simple answers, allowing you to implement the suggested activities as soon as possible. However, if you want to explore deeper, you are invited to visit our website www.EduMusica.es, where you will be able to find additional resources, like videos with examples of some musical activities, or more in-depth explanation of the principles and methods.
I was inspired by a YouTube video as well as a fellow lumberjock’s project to make a few of these of my own. I turned the handles on my lathe, used some scrap copper pipe from my water softener installation for the collar, and used some old drill bits that I reground for the cutter on both. The left one is made of Koa scraps with a 3/8 inch bit and the right is made of Cherry scraps with a 1/4 inch bit. Thanks for looking!
Nice work Matt on the tools. Never tried the drill bit thing yet but heard they work well. I enjoy making my own also. Seems like I tend to grab for my own every time I turn. Now make yourself a few carbide ones. Its easy and fun. Top 2 and bottom one are store bought. If you make any more let me know, I’m always interested in turning tools. Working on another one now. Thanks for the pics.
Those are nice doubleDD! I’m definitely going to have to make more of my own tools. I’ve never thought about buying carbide and making custom tools out of it. I’m going to have to now, though! Yours look incredible. One thing I like about the ones I made is that I paid $10 for the bits, and besides the tools I used to make them, that’s all the money I have in them. And they’re customized to exactly how I wanted them. I’m definitely going to make more.
This is my first try and I’am happy with the ribbon. This site is a great place to learn new things. The box is black Walnut.
Very cool looking work Ted, I am going to have to give the old wood ribbon a try some day. Thanks for sharing !

Preservation Pantry’s root-to-top, stem-to-core method recycles every part of fruits and vegetables so that farmer’s market produce stays delicious long after the season ends. Whether you’re an experienced homesteader or a novice canner, Marshall shows you how to create recipes for canning and preserving that you can then incorporate into finished dishes.

Web Hosting Bandwidth Calculator 1.0 Web Hosting Bandwidth Calculator is free software for estimating the monthly bandwidth needed for a web site. This can help determine which web host or hosting plan is appropriate. Enter the size of a typical web page, or have it calculated automatically from a URL or file. Then enter the number of hits or visits expected during a time period, and use the resulting bandwidth estimate to aid in finding a good host for your traffic needs.
NT Meter 1.51 An advanced tool for network traffic monitoring and statistics. It monitors the bandwidth usage of a specified network connection on your computer, graphically and numerically displays its state in real-time. With NT Meter you can easily check the current state of the network connection and view detailed statistical reports.
Multiple interface meter It seens to be the same software "Bandwidth Meter Pro". And it measures the bandwidth for each interface, or all as one unique interface, as you wish. However, you need to select each interface you need to measure, being undesirable when you have virtual interfaces being added or removed from your system at any time. Other poor feature is to configure each rates you need to measure in backgroup, if you forget to do it, you don't have the information from the past.
ShaPlus Bandwidth Meter 1.3 ShaPlus Bandwidth Meter remains in tray and displays the bandwidth consumed for the session, day and month. This will be useful for people with limited bandwidth/month internet connection. Other Features : - Option to make meter always visible. - Transparency of meter can be adjusted. - Option to exclude bandwidth during certain period of day. (for those who have unmetered bandwidth during certain hours of the day)
Thanks a lot for your bandwidth meter. Works great.It\'s getting harder and harder to get anything for my OX 10 10.3.9. I\'ll guess I\'ll have to bite the bullet and get a new computer.Thanks again.Digby Sarkassian.
nice stuff...it\'s user friendly...maybe it will better if you put some profile management, so anyone who have more than 1 internet access can use the bandwidht meter without reset the counter...
Excelent I like the Bandwith meter, over the last few days we have been able to see on how quickly the mb add by doing basic stuff, like checking emails on so on.Thanks

One more Question. If the Minolta (ND Filter installed) gave me an F-stop value of 16 while filming at the beach, sunny conditions of course, would this be correct with the filter in place? Or should the f-stop be F11or F8? If the fstop is showing 16 can I open up another 1/2 stop and get a good exposure?
The most important thing you need to find out is 'is my camera's light meter still giving correct exposures?'. The only way to know that is to shoot a test roll on reversal film. You can't second guess that. Sure, by contemplating the sunny 16 rule, or by using another camera you can decide if the camera's reading 'sounds about right'. But you can't know just how right without a test roll.
As for using an ND filter, no problem. Screw it on and use the camera as normal. The camera's meter will see through the nd and expose accordingly. I am not sure what nd factor the hoya #4 has. Usually one thinks of factors in terms of thirds of a stop. A full one stop factor (or three thirds of a stop) is called a '.3' So I am not sure what a #4 is. But not to worry, you can find out by simply using it on your camera and seeing the difference.
As for opening up half a stop, what was that about? Were you thinking this because a beach is a typical 'back light' situation? If so, then that is fair enough. Depends how back lit the subjects are though.
Still photography filters often seem to use the confusing system which is only in full f-stops of 2,4,8, etc. Each doubling is a halving of the amount of light (one stop).
That doesn't answer your question. But if your light meter is TTL (through the lens) like most super 8 cameras adding the ND filter should not put your exposures out assuming your camera is working.
BTW, If you want to use your cameras TTL lightmeter, it's good idea to buy grey card. It is very helpful in most situations.
Thanks to all of you for your help here. First I should say that yes the automatic exposure works very well! I have used this camera many times with 64T. As I stated earlier I am now using Ektachrome 100D. I shot a roll on Father's day, and that is now being processed. Once it returns I will see how it turned out. The camera does read 100D film so it should be fine. I guess my real question was, after installing a ND filter, what Fstop does the camera open up from? Another words what is the starting Fstop the camera is metering from to open the aperture after the ND filter has been added? Let's say I see an Fstop of 16 after the ND filter has been installed, would this mean the starting Fstop was 32? Or does the camera start from an F22? I am using the Sunny 16 logic here but with a twist I suppose. Hopefully this makes sense to someone ha ha! I guess I also would like to find out if I can open the aperture a little more at the beach if I see an Fstop of 16, could I go to F11? Or would this bring in to much light? I like brighter images when I project them on the screen. I have used this method a few times with 64t and all looks good. I guess my lack of experience has me wondering if anything larger than say an F16 at the beach would be to much for 100D, even with a ND filter. Also I would assume that if the Nd filter opens the aperture up 2 more Fstops than 16 would be probably correct at the beach? I am not looking for exact calculations just something to gauge by when shooting in different light. The sunny 16 rule is something to look at when shooting under certain lighting conditions. With 100D is it a little different. Hope all of this makes sense. In my mind it seems too.
Shanec8mm, if your lightmeter reads f16 behind ND4 filter then correct aperture without the filter is f32.
Bakanosaru, ND4 is not same as ND6, but ND4 is the same as ND.6. The so called "cine ND filters" are also in the same scale, they are just named after their optical density: ND.3, ND.6, ND.9, etc.
mauka wrote: Shanec8mm, if your lightmeter reads f16 behind ND4 filter then correct aperture without the filter is f32.
Thank you this answers my question. f32 is what I thought the camera would be metering from. Yes the Hoya filter I am using reduces light by 2 stops.
So when I ran film on Father's day the f32 I saw in bright light was probably correct then. I was not using a ND filter when filming that day. The Minolta has never left me down so it will probably do just fine at the beach, and areas around the beach.

Why Nuclear Plants are a safe zone from terrorist attacks – Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy Australia
There has been a lot of contemplation over the consequences of occurrence of an attack by a large aircraft similar to the 2001 World Trade Centre attack in New York. This time the target being a nuclear facility aiming at radioactive materials. Studies show that nuclear reactors would be robust as compared to any other civil installations used to resist such attacks. A thorough study financed by the US department of Energy and conducted by US Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) concluded that the US reactor would be strong enough to withstand attacks from large commercial aircraft.
A fully fueled Boeing 767-400 weighing over 200 metric tons and flying at its precision speed of 560 km/h close to the ground was used as the basis of the study. The wingspan of this plane was greater than the diameter of reactor containment buildings and has 4.3 metric ton engines 15 meters apart. The analysis used two approaches to assess the impacts of the attacks. First, they focused on the impact of a single engine because this would be the most direct and detrimental missile on the centerline of the containment building. Secondly, they assessed the what-ifs of the entire aircraft when its fuselage made a direct hit on the centerline of the containment building, in which the engines would ricochet off the fuselage. In both cases, no part of the aircraft, no matter how hard it hit the centerline, penetrated the containment and other studies affirmed this fact.
Penetrating reinforced concrete is not as simple as it seems, it has a lot of impediments that the terrorists wouldn’t even lay their hands on. For instance, even a relatively weak reinforced concrete would only succumb to high-speed artillery shells or specially designed “bunker busting” ordnance. An aircraft hitting the containment heavily-reinforced concrete would immediately disintegrate with little or no impact on the containment reactors. Findings documented by EPRI in 1981 reported that a lot of testing are in place to assess the implications of even the worst possible realistic chances of core melting and containment failure would cause very negligible if any to the public no matter the cause of the containment failure.
By 1988, there were extensive testing to prove that a nuclear plant would stand the impacts of a massive aircraft attack and Sandia National Laboratories in the US was tasked with the duty of demonstrating the unequal distribution of energy absorption when a large aircraft hit a hardened target. This was to see if a proposed Japanese nuclear power plant would stand the impacts of an aircraft attack. For this demo, they used a rocket propelled a 27-metric ton F4 Phantom jet which had both engines close to its fuselage, would hit hard on a 7m thick slab at a fast speed of 765 km/h. Most of the impacts went to the destruction of the aircraft itself, actually about 96% of the kinetic energy within the aircraft was responsible for its own destruction and slightly on the penetration of the concrete while the other remaining about 4% was lost off trying to penetrate the 700-tonne slab. The maximum damage on this experiment was only a slight 60 mm.
As early as the late 1970s, there were already conclusions put in place by the UK Central Electricity Generating Board on the possibilities of a fully laden and fully fueled large passenger aircraft deliberately slamming into a nuclear reactor as a consequence of a hijack. They deduced that no possible or foreseen damage would happen to the nuclear reactor since the aircraft would crash up on the many obstacle buildings and concrete even before reaching the concrete biological shield surrounding the reactor. By the 1980s, there were already plants in the US that were structured and deigned to literally stand the hard hits of a fully laden large military transport aircraft and maintain a cold shutdown with precision.
The US has always been proactive in matters of security measures brought about by the mishaps of such events and has put up very stern security measures. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission is mandated to oversee these measures and require that any nuclear power plant should have laid out measures to ensure the safety of the public from danger of radioactive elements in case of any breach in the plant. It requires plants to setup barriers, a non-penetrative security station as well as the physical structure to be strong enough; all these would sum up to $2 billion to the industry. Anyway, these regulations check on:
The reactor containment buildings are designed to withstand any form of danger. With a lot of reinforced concrete coupled with a number of safety shutdown systems that are able to withstand even the trials of hurricanes, floods, aircraft attacks or even tornadoes, these buildings are constructed in such a way that they become resilient and withstand any physical catastrophe or threat.
The physical requirements of the barricade should be composed of thick layers of concrete reinforced with steel in order to ensure maximum safety. These concrete barricades are in layers in which they protect the radioactive nuclear elements.
The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires that each and every nuclear plant should deploy well trained and well-armed security guards that cover the grounds with very tight security each and every minute of the day. Also, there must be hi-tech electronic surveillance that works hand in hand with the security personnel in taking cover of the nuclear plant.
Periodic tests and mock drills are should be conducted by the plant to demonstrate that the plant can withstand raids of well-trained paramilitary force. These mocks are conducted in such a way that they resemble the real-life scenario in which the plant might be under attack or siege, and the plant security personnel should disable this threat. The attackers would be in possession of weapons and explosives trying to break in and it is upon the security to end the attack. The mock drills are conducted under the supervision of Nuclear Regulatory Commission where they assume to have an insider within the plant that feeds the attackers with vital information on the equipment within the plant. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission assesses the drill and if they require any necessary reinforcements to the already existing security measure, they advise from the results of such a drill.
The nuclear power plant might have threats from within in that plant personnel might be part of a terrorist group or might be aiding in the same course. So, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ensures that plants have programs in place to avoid any such instance. It requires that energy companies should conduct impromptu drug tests to at least half of its employees annually. Employees pass a very strict background checks evaluating their education, psychological, criminal and drug related histories for starters. New employees and contractors are subjected to a mandatory drugs and alcohol screening tests which they must pass to be considered fit to work.
The US Federal Bureau of Investigation goes ahead to classify nuclear plants as ‘hardened’ targets because of the rigorous security measures and activities put in place in the maintenance of the premises.
There was a study conducted in the 1970s examining the possible effects in case a terrorist attack was successful and caused a breach in the containment structure and a meltdown in the core, in which such an occurrence would never happen. The study showed that these radioactive materials would stick on to the surface of the containment or become soluble salts trapped in the remnants of the containment building. Though there were some radioactive materials that would escape the containment reactor that would still reach the general population, and it is only under such an extreme situation, and only under these rare conditions. This damage would only affect a small population on several kilometers from the plant facilities.
While there were already robust structures put in place to withstand the tests of attacks by the start of the 21st century, the 2001 attack was an eye-opener that led to reinforcement in the security measure and oversight of NRC on such plants. The various studies in place have time and again depicted that these reactors would stand the ultimate force of any attack and would retain all its radioactive elements untouched, even under the attack of any paramilitary sabotage on the plants, giving more people peace of mind. Clearly, the massive structures that are already in place would be very hard for terrorists to even try to attack, even if they attack, they would cause little or no damage to the physical structure itself. The radioactive element will be safely protected and such attacks would not result in any radioactive releases.

All readers like a good seduction regardless of what we’re reading. As writers it’s the seduction of words and the stories in our heads and hearts that push us. The characters become real people we often view as family members, and we want to share them with the world.
In the quest of sharing our families with as many people as possible, some of us writers have created street teams or launch teams. Teams that in a way become a different kind of family. These teams are made up of readers who love reading romance and are eager to share their loves with as many people as possible via social media, blogs or personal connections.
One such team is the NDcent Dames, a group of readers who help spread the word about my stories. The Dames are looking to grow, and the first book that would be available for an early review is SEDUCED IN SAND, the 5th installment in my Tulle and Tulips series.

i know this girl very shy, i want to teach her how to dance salsa but she doesn’t seems ready to hit the clubs and try it out so my last options were one of our places wish she doesn’t wants to do
please if anyone of your guys knows a dance studio in san francisco i could use for a couple hours let me know
I’ll be visiting San Francisco later in September and would like to rent a condo or studio for a week, do you have websites to suggest?
there is any one there that can tell me where i can find a place to rent in north beach san francisco to do my workshops. need to be flat, carpet, cozy, a good space to fit 10 to 15 people sitting in circles with just chairs. like a yoga studio. no tables. thanks
I dunno how cozy you need but Fort Mason has rooms they rent out for many uses, and probably cheaper then you’d get from a private source.
Try finding private organizations that have buildings that aren’t used all the time who may be willing to rent out. Going to the organization and asking may even bring attention to the org that they /could/ rent out their space for income. They may be interested in the opportunity. They may also not be interested, be respectful. One type of place that I think of is churches. I’m not sure of the content of your classes, but if it’s church appropriate, then maybe try talking with a few local churches to rent out some room during their off nights. They get a little extra money, they get publicity, and you get a nice room out of it.
You could also try such places as Masonic Lodges. They’re private buildings that commonly rent out for parties, meetings, get togethers, and sometimes, weekly events such as yours. Find a local lodge and call them up (or check their website), see if they’re willing to rent out.
I’m sure there are many other options, but there are tons of churches and Masonic Lodges everywhere. Shouldn’t be too hard to find a place.
Hello! I’m going to work for 1 year in San Francisco and will be looking for an app to rent. The company I’ll be working for is in South San Francisco (not very far from the airport). Thereby, the questions:
SSF being so close to SF makes it expensive to live there as well. The further down the peninsula it gets cheaper and the areas are much nicer. Millbrae,burlingame san mateo are all cheaper than SSF as the commute is longer but it is not to long. You can still be in SF in 30 minutes time.
i have a home in the bay area that i would like to rent to movie studios for shooting and/or housing crew and/or actors
I’d like a safe neighborhood within easy walking distance of a grocery store and fast food places. My target rent is $1,500 to $1,900 and I don’t care if it’s a large studio or 1 bedroom. I would also need to use public transit to get to downtown. I’m a single straight guy in my early 30′s.
Well, I’m sure there are some better suggestions but you could always try to Western Addition, I go to the University of San Francisco which is in the Western Addition and I like it. It’s a little bit quieter than anywhere downtown and there are plenty of stores, I go to the Lucky Market on Fulton and Trader Joe’s on Masonic and I can walk to both (although I usually take the bus because I’m lazy). Also, there are three bus lines I like to call “Old Faithful,” the 5, 31, and the 38 all of which take you to Market Street (but remember that after 6:00 P.M. The 5 will drop you off right in the Tenderloin so if you need to go downtown at night take the 31). You should try going to http://www.city-data.com/forum which you have to register but it’s free, the people in the San Francisco forum all live in San Francisco and they can give you more specific examples. Avoid going to the Tenderloin and stay away from Fillmore Street. Also, although it’s close to downtown, don’t be tempted by the cheaper prices of the Civic Center and Van Ness area, it’s really loud, dirty, and way too close to the Tenderloin for comfort.

Very very cheap accommodation so obviously expectations need to be accordingly. Location is absolutely perfect if you want to be close to Khao San Road with loads of restaurants and shops. The front desk demands a deposit of THB 1000 (cash) at time of check in which would have been nice to know before arrival. The pool area was great (with being in the heart of Bangkok) The room was very basic and the air con was horrible!! Very noisy, did not cool down the room nor help with the humidity at all!
Easy to navigate and get an overview with this portal. However the front desk demanded a deposit of THB 1000 (cash) at time of check in. It would have been nice to have been informed of this at time of booking.
Nice journey. The hotel is very well located. In the touristic area. the swimming pool is very pleasant.

Despite how long it's been since her last interaction with Ella, Soleil can't help the good-humored lilt in the sound of her voice. She's amused, of course - recalling just how much chatter there had been when Ella first arrived on the scene. Although she had long severed ties with the Orlavs, she still considers Ella to be someone of a little more than just a simple acquaintance.
Jameson Orlav 07/09/18 "Chin up, buttercup." Jameson tapped the tip of his blood stained finger against the crest of Ella's chin, "If you hadn't put the hlupák down, then I would have." He grinned, "I enjoyed watching you take care of it, though."
Jameson Orlav 01/30/18 Jameson saunters into the upstairs of Valar Morghulis, looking for Ella. He slings himself onto whichever sofa is closest, his legs dangling over the side as he waved her over lazily. "Ella." He drawls, "Please tell me why you keep some of these insufferable pledges around. Getting rid of people isn't all that difficult. I can help!"
John Doe 01/18/18 “Sounds like you have been in the wrong kind of marriage. I’m fortunate in that I am in the right kind, but I know for some they have to just take whatever they can get.”
John Doe 01/18/18 “Yes, that is the aroma of contentment, happiness and a great deal of sex. It’s intoxicating really.”
Miryam 10/02/17 *Takes the jug back replacing her straw being careful not to infect the Frankenstein Doll*
Sure, I'm happy to be 'the dungeon' for infractors against the mutt. But why wait? Toss a few down for fun...
Really?! I would LOVE to play with Hank. I'm great with puppies. He'll be nice and tuckered out for you when you get home. :)
Ouch. We’ll see how you feel when he pisses on all your sh-t. And before Quinn offers, we’re never dogsitting. Keep your shady dog over there.
Lloyd R Darrow 09/24/17 "I'm not too concerned about you sharing a city with my wife. If you're stuck in New Orleans, I can always make the trip." He allowed a pause in the conversation, mentally considering his calendar. "I'll chalk it up to business." He was already walking back towards his house now, ready to wind down the conversation.
"You know where to find me once you decide. Have a pleasant evening, Ms. Donovan." With that, he disconnected the line.
Lloyd R Darrow 09/24/17 Lloyd grinned, shaking his head as he continued to pace further from the house. She wanted to play dumb, and he wouldn't deny his own amusement. She would even earn a brief chuckle from his lungs. "If that's your truth, then so be it. Caused a bit of a mess on my end of things.. But I like a challenge every now and then. Keeps things interesting."
Lloyd R Darrow 09/24/17 Lloyd had just cleaned up the mess Ella had created. And at the end of it all, he stepped out to make a phone call. He shot a glance back towards the house, ensuring he hadn't been followed. He waited patiently as the phone rang, beginning to speak once it connected.
Atticus Hammond 09/23/17 Atticus looks at the redhead with a mix of horror and disgust. He touches butts because Mackenzie tells him it builds character. NOT because he wants to touch any other butt but Camille's. Staring at the grotesque woman, acknowledging the wink and her words, he only has one response:
Jameson Orlav 09/15/17 Jameson has been tasked. Well, it's not really a task, per say. More like, some smelly werewolf who lives in the mansion upstairs had insisted that he take these odd looking severed heads and deliver each of them to a respective patron. The Doctor doesn't quite understand why, but he doesn't actually care in the least. Tiberius, as he had introduced himself, had paid him a pretty penny to see that the deed got done.
He doubted that the mutt had expected him to put his own spin on the delivery, however. Jameson waited until the guy fled to go out and find some pretty pink boxes. White ribbons would accompany the painted cardboard- tied at the top into fancy, frilly bows. There's no way that any unsuspecting victim would come to realize what was actually inside of the box until it had been delivered.
Deranged doesn't even begin to encompass Jameson Orlav. To each person he drops off a box. While they're away, of course. His last encounter inside the house had brought immediate trouble for Ella. He would look to avoid that this time, if it was possible.
To Gideon, Quinn, and Ella herself. Inside each of their rooms they'd find a box. For Quinn and Gideon, their room would house two.
On the first and oldest head in his possession he would swipe the lipstick over the full lips of the dead girl. The remainder of her face remained pale, her skin tinted icy blue thanks to being both post-mortem and cold. This head was going to Ella Donovan. The home wrecker. No matter her faults, she always presented herself as beautiful and plush.
And yo, there's no sign that Jameson has been here. Just so we're clear. Let's all relax on the coronary front for now.
I'm ok. It's been a rough couple of days, but I think I got everything calmed down on my end. I'm looking forward to coming home. I know we will be out for a little while longer.
That makes sense. Everything always feels numb when you're drunk. It's not my favorite part, but it beats advil.
Grand. Whichever is comfortable and convenient for you. Not sure stained teeth are quite necessary, though.
Given our mutual interests, I would very much like to discuss the relationship of our Sanctuaries. I am in New Orleans should you like to chat. My number is attached.
Jesus, he's still missing? I've been away for some time. Figured he'd already found his way back. And, no. My wife's behind is perfectly sized.
And where the hell did you lose him? Another accidental confession of love send him running for the hills?
Quinn Abernathy 07/29/17 Swallowing, Quinn considers her options. A quick glance around is made, and the girl steels herself, placing a smile on her face. Everything is fine. Everything is going to be fine.
Of course they're scarecrows. To scare the crows. From the vegetables. They're supposed to be scary. Did I make them too scary?
I'm ready as I'll ever be. Bring a bat. I found a metal pipe that might be important but we can discuss that if we make it out alive.
There might be more intimidation in numbers, but I can't guarantee this won't turn into a massacre. Someone might die. Preferably the possum/rat/thing.
Greetings from the Lufcuh! I haven't met some of you yet, and I'm sorry for that! My real name is Quinn. I like moonshine, puppies, and karoake. I'm currently practicing my drinking skills to beat Orson on our next bar trip! If you need anything, let me know!
I've never been to New Orleans before. I suppose I could manage a brief stay. If I come, I expect a po'boy.
I have six inches on you easy, you sl*tty f*cking leprechaun. Go hump a cactus before you get into a fight you won't live to see the end of.
Yes! He's taking me to the bar. He thinks he can out-drink me. Jokes on him. I'm gonna get him white girl wasted and then interview him.
Yea!! That one! Good looking with the accent. We gotta find his profile again. I need to see it. I NEED to.
Ella!!! I made a friend! He looks big and scary, but he's actually really nice. He has a good smile, too. Did you Tinder him? What did his Tinder say?
"Yeah, got a little pressure from the wife to start campaigning. I was going to take you up on the offer to make a banner for us, but figured you were busy with the new Sanctuary. Didn't want to bother you with the trivial stuff, you know? Congrats, by the way."
Quinn Abernathy 05/04/17 Quinn looks at her phone and giggles at the message. It can't be helped. Quickly, she types a reply.
'I'll be right over! I'm not a catfish, though. I don't think. No way could I hold my breath under water for that long!'
Quinn Abernathy 05/04/17 Within minutes, her phone chirps for her attention. An alert from Tinder! Quinn squeals to herself, squirming in a happy sort of dance where she sits in the cafe. Coffee nearly spills, people stare at her in bewilderment. What could possibly be so exciting in this day and age?
She unlocks her phone, opening the app to reveal the face on the other side. "Ella... bored af. Af? Lufcuh Hhh-mu. Maybe she's Jewish? Sounds Jewish? That's nice. Party everyday. I like those. Jameson... must be her other friend."
Quinn Abernathy 05/04/17 She had heard from a very friendly stranger that there was a way to find new friends. Quinn wasn't sure if they had the same definition of friend, but she figured she would give it a shot. Ironically, the friendly stranger did not end up being a friend. In fact, he'd been too friendly and invited her over to see his puppy.
Having no idea what she is actually doing, she downloads the Tinder app (like the Ke$ha song?) and makes herself a profile. "Q-U-I-N-N... age 31..." she stops and stares at the screen, completely missing every other field.
Lloyd R Darrow 05/03/17 "Must be the accent." His grin grows wider, a slight shake to his head as he grabs the two cards, sliding them back towards his body victoriously. "So tell me, how is your not so private love-affair with Doctor Orlav unfolding?" Frankly, the man is amused. One had to admire her brashness, unless of course her brazen nature came in-between their marriage.
Lloyd R Darrow 05/03/17 Momentarily distracted by the buzzing of his phone, the man takes a moment to answer his wife before setting his phone down, screen unlocked and facing up. "Goldfish, mm? My mother always had a thing for Old Maid." After a short scoff, he slaps down his first card - a 7. By no means a good card, but it was certainly better than a 2.
"I should not have spoken so soon.. Perhaps luck is not on my side, after all." He falls silent as he sips from his beer, eyes meeting hers with a closed-lip grin.
Lloyd R Darrow 05/03/17 With a smirk and a scoff, he moves to sit opposite of her, a beer of his own in hand. "Trust me, Ella, I won't be the one crying. Unless of course you're some sort of card shark, in which case, I'll shuffle first. Can't risk you weighing the deck on me."
After a swig of his ale, he sets his bottle down and splits the deck, the thrum of cards against his skin the only sound unless he evens them out against the desktop. "Solitare, you said? Why not.. War?"
Lloyd R Darrow 05/03/17 Along with the aforementioned beer and pizza was Lloyd, an amused glint in his eyes. "No, no. I've a handle on everything." Slipping past the slender red head, the man is careful not to set the box or the six-pack down upon any paperwork that appears sensitive. "Just to be clear, I will not allow you even a single victory, Ms. Donovan. While I can appreciate that it is a special day for you, I take cards quite seriously."
I think you may need to clean the lenses, or adjust the prescription, if you intend on keeping them.
Nah... he won't be mad at you. His angry is taken right now. As for the glasses... they're kinda old. Scissors?
Lloyd R Darrow 05/02/17 Lloyd was never a talkative man to begin with, and while alcohol seemed to have loosened his tongue some, he was rather reserved on their walk back to the compound. The lawyer rarely stayed on The Order's campus, as a family home was obviously more convenient. Standing outside of her door now, her hand on his chin, Lloyd allows the situation to warrant a small smile.
"Another time." Temptation, while beguiling, was no longer his weakness. At least he could rest easy knowing she was now home safe. "Goodnight, Ms. Donovan." After planting a kiss against the blush of her cheek, he breaks away from her touch, feet carrying him in the direction of home.
Lloyd R Darrow 05/02/17 As Lloyd follows her to the door, one hand rests at the small of her back while the other steadies her, though the man is by no means more stable than she. As they depart the bar into the cool evening air, the opportunity presents itself once again to walk away. Yet, Lloyd follows, like a moth to a flame.
Soleil Whitaker 05/01/17 Soleil let out an amused snort, and held up her hand. "No, no," she replied, "I think we're going to stay out of this one. There's no competition in my mind, anyways" - she paused to tap her temple - "Thank you, though."
Lloyd R Darrow 05/01/17 Lloyd allows the agave liquid to carry the distaste in his mouth away, verdant eyes looking at Ella anew. Love his wife? What a trivial question. Of course he loved his wife. Love, however, never promised fidelity.
"Love is inconsequential, Ella. Surely you're smart enough to know it accounts for very little at the end of the day." He raises a hand, thumb skimming gently across her chin, his expression unreadable. "You are rather clever, aren't you, Ms. Donovan?"
I don't know if I can? I'm actually hanging out with my ex and trying to save Jameson's ass from certain death, currently.
Soleil Whitaker 05/01/17 "You know, Ella," Soleil laughed as she sauntered by, "I could get behind that if I weren't so into me and Rhiannon as best couple." She flashed a friendly grin at the redhead; her words weren't intended to be confrontational - just an acknowledgment of the flyer she'd just been handed. As much as she loved Elouise and as loyal as she was, Soleil found the Jameson-Ella dynamic rather entertaining.
Noura Orlav 05/01/17 I have really high hopes. I've already started planning your wedding. I have a scrapbook. You look pretty damn good with your head pasted on Kate Middleton's body. Jameson isn't very convincing as Prince William, but it's an improvement.
I never did catch your number. At any rate, I'm free for drinks this evening if you are. I'll be at Yevgeny's until 11.
Lloyd R Darrow 04/18/17 "Seven?" The man pauses, a hand reaching up to scratch his cheek as he ponders the prospect. He'd simply have to let Cait know he would not be home in time to tuck the boys in. No sweat. "That should work fine. I will clear my schedule."
After a few awkward attempts, he successfully retrieves his papers from his new acquaintance. "I am a naturally hot-blooded individual, though. I believe I'd be best served keeping you warm, if anything. And I have a coat." His stark tone is far from flirtatious, but it's simply in his nature. Must be the accent. "It was a pleasure meeting you, Ella. I shall see you at seven."
Lloyd R Darrow 04/17/17 "Free? Tonight?" He enunciates the words only to better comprehend the question. The lawyer is a literal man, working in fact. That is why the law suits him so well - he is able to function in a world of black and white; right and wrong. But, Lloyd is under clear instructions. Socialize, be welcoming.
Lloyd R Darrow 04/16/17 Nervous would be an understatement for the poor man. He is innately awkward, still socially inept even with his own spouse. So, factor in an embarrassing introduction to a complete stranger, and Lloyd is due for a stroke at any moment. "Do I.. Love my wife?" He blinks several times, unsure if she had just actually presented him with such a loaded question.
"I.. In a manner of speaking.. It's impossible to say.." He finally pauses from his cascade of fragments, clearing his throat thereafter. "She had children!" He pipes back up, being just as disastrous as before, the poor ball of nerves. "I, ahm. Yes. I love my wife."
Lloyd R Darrow 04/15/17 Lloyd shuffles down the halls, distracted by paperwork he shuffles through with dexterous fingers. Tongue clacking lowly against the roof of his mouth, the lawyer continues on, stocking feet gliding against laminate floor in an almost child-like fashion. Out of the corner of his eye, a red-head stands. Without much attention to detail, he stuffs the paperwork under an arm, quickly sliding over to make a comical, abrupt appearance before Caitlyn.
"Hey, Cait. What are y-" He cuts off, his face a mask of sheer horror. They're multiplying. "I thought.. No. Not my wife. Hello, I'm Lloyd." The man offers his hand, the stack of papers consequently cascading to the ground, slipping every which way, and generally making a disaster of his before-meticulously sorted files. This first encounter isn't awkward at all.
Elouise Warrock 04/13/17 Been thinking those insults up all day, I'm sure. Glad to see you're so concerned about my ass, and my child.
He has a great ass, so I wouldn't be surprised. Have fun with the major disappoint that will be his ultimate rejection!
Elouise Warrock 04/13/17 Touché. At least I'm not an unwashed trollop, which I'm sure is hard for you.
You can gawk at my husband all that you'd like, but unfortunately enough for you nothing will ever come to fruition. He's a loyal man. And you're just...not good looking enough to ruin a marriage over.
Noura Orlav 04/13/17 I'm glad you didn't even pose that as a question, because drinks should never be a question.
Soleil Whitaker 02/07/17 Soleil kept grinning as she thrust out her hand. Ella seemed innocent and sweet enough. "People are indeed friendly," she agreed, nodding, "For the most part, anyways." A couple of faces flashed through her mind - there were some dwellers of the Realm who scared the living sh*t out of her. Luckily, she hadn't had any unpleasant encounters. Yet.
"Pleasure is mine, actually. If you ever need anything, Ella," she continued, nonchalantly digging the toe of her boot into the ground, "Don't be a stranger. I'm always around."
Soleil had heard all the latest commotion and drama regarding the Orlavs and some new girl. Afterall, it made the front page of this week's issue of Death and Style. Who the f*ck was she? Soleil had to find out for herself.
She was passing by when she recognized the girl from the picture printed in D&S. She figured it wouldn't hurt to make herself known to the stranger, so she approached slowly. Clearing her throat, she brought two fingers up to her forehead in a small salute. "Hello," she said, announcing her presence, "I'm Soleil. I just wanted to give you a friendly, yet late welcome to the Realm." Soleil hoped the other girl wouldn't find her behavior suspicious, and offered a wide smile in attempt to thwart any initial animosity or uncertainty.
Did she just... oh God. She did. Noura found a spirit animal. She knows she did, because she can practically feel the annoyance coming from home. Lowering her hand once sure of her composure, a solid grin can be found painted upon her lips. "Just try not to feed his ego too much."
-Has appeared out of nowhere, fingers tangling against long strands of bright ginger hair. Is entranced. Captivated. Allured.-
Jameson Orlav 02/02/17 Eternally hypersensitive to the atmosphere and energies around him, there isn't a second of this strange girls elevated enamoring that he doesn't pick up on.
He's teetering the line between uncomfortable and intrigued, and though her fingers lingered against his hand, he's the first to pull away.
"Pleasure, Ella. I'm not sure that's the best idea but.." Chocolate eyes narrow beneath knotted brows, "Are you hanging around Moscow for a while?"
Elouise Warrock 02/02/17 Elouise's eyebrows lift in utter amusement. "Good luck with that. Let me know how it goes."
Elouise Warrock 02/02/17 Elouise can't help but scoff. And then her trigger finger itches. A condescending smirk plants itself on her now decidedly hostile visage.
"You mean the oaf that just lumbered off? He's my husband. And you won't be getting his number. Best steer clear of married men, especially ones with violent wives."
Handsome? Handsome. Yes, he was quite the handsome fellow. Jameson straightens up, composure tight, as though he were preening. A bird putting his proud feathers on display.
"My name is Jameson." He extends a hand, offering calloused fingers for the girl to shake, "And you are..?"
Lennox Orlav 07/25/18 "Playing hard ball, I see. I can admire that." Lennox nods to himself, appearing thoughtful. He can play nice for however long it's necessary. Patience is key.
Dark eyes shift toward the woman walking beside him, a small furrow between his brows. "No. My memory is decent even when I've been drinking." And how he fervently wishes it wasn't. "Why?"
Lennox Orlav 07/25/18 Pretty, but not too bright. How disappointing. Seems his baby brother's taste in women isn't fantastic, which he already knew. Seeing it firsthand drives it home.
"First you imply I'm hot and then say I'd be handsome if I shaved my unibrow. Your indecisiveness might make a man self conscious. I can't figure out if you're flirting or insulting," he chuckles.
Lennox Orlav 07/25/18 "Because I asked," Lennox grins. "You're right, I could be a serial killer. I'll start to walk the opposite direction if you like..." He begins to turn but stops at her name and goes back to where he was.
"Elouise. I'm Lennox, your lunch meal ticket." His face twists. "Ted Bundy? Really? Maybe if he got rid of the unibrow."
Lennox Orlav 07/21/18 "Consider me prepared. Fortunately for us, we can order all the desserts you want," he laughs, obviously undeterred at the knowledge of this woman poaching from his plate. "You do need to share one more thing with me: your name."
Soleil Whitaker 07/20/18 Soleil presses the call button as soon as she receives Elouise's most recent text. It's clear that meeting in person isn't an option, and Soleil is tired of this futile back-and-forth messaging. She wants an answer, an explanation. Something, anything. The line rings a few times before the call connects, and when it does, Soleil is speechless. She'd been prepared to yell, curse, and scream at the woman she'd once loved vehemently, but now... in this moment? She's unable to make a sound.
Lennox Orlav 07/20/18 "What a delightful death it would be." Winks. "Let me guess... you'll be eating half of mine, too?"
Lennox Orlav 07/20/18 "I thought millennials were all about equality. That means you pay half, right?" The grin indicates his teasing. "Yes, you eat, I pay. Try to leave some for me, if it's not too much to ask."
Lennox Orlav 07/20/18 "Why not a lunch date first?" Lennox chuckles. "A lapdance would be great but I'm not that much of a d-ck. No pressure."
Lennox Orlav 07/20/18 "No. I would remember that particular pleasure from such a beautiful woman. Are you offering?"
Lennox Orlav 07/20/18 "By all means. I wouldn't dream to think you may care even the tiniest amount. You go on not caring and I'll enjoy my half Snickers you so kindly shared."
Lennox Orlav 07/20/18 "I'm disappointed." Lennox accepts the half Snickers and takes a bite. "You did share a little, if not the full bar. Does that mean you care a little, too?"
Life has a nasty way of giving you the finger when you finally think everything is perfect. One day, all is well, the next, it isn't.
I love you but am not in love with you, and I can't see falling head over heels for anybody any time soon.
"They were so hospitable. How dare they take me under their wing and give me a home. Total garbage."
Come now, that's no way to behave. I'm forwarding you the details to an apartment in the city. Drop by and let's see what we can get up to.
Deep down, Soleil knows that's a lie. Elouise had been her best friend; the bond they shared was unmistakable, undeniable. More importantly, it's permanent. The young Whitaker hated Elouise for the things she'd coerced her into doing, hated herself for being so easily betrayed. But, the older woman would always, always hold a small part of Soleil's heart captive. And that, perhaps, was what she hated most.
It’s not hatred or resentment that push the words out from between her lips. Rather, it’s unabashed honesty. Soleil’s view of the woman had changed drastically in the days following Trista’s death - the affair had just acted as a catalyst for her abrupt departure from Moscow.
Elouise is practically sprinting away before the younger woman can continue with her response. Logan gurgles quietly in his car seat, fully awake and attentive. Soleil steps closer, fingers reaching out to caress the infant’s rosy cheek. Their eyes lock for a moment, and Soleil can’t help but notice the uncanny resemblance in the child’s features. She’d been swindled. Again. Forced into a situation that she knows will turn out to be more than problematic.
With a deep breath, Soleil retrieves her phone to type out a quick message to her wife. This is not going to end well. Soleil can feel it.
Soleil Whitaker 12/11/17 If Soleil Whitaker is at all phased by Elouise’s new nature, she most certainly does not let it show. She stares, arms still crossed over her chest. “I will always be grateful for what you did for me, Elouise. I’d be dead without you,” she states without a hint of insincerity. The older woman had, indeed, saved Soleil’s life. And yes, they had loved eachother - vehemently in their own ways. Truth be told, Soleil could never hate Elouise. Not for the affair, at least.
“I hate you because you used me, not because we slept together. I hate that you knew what I felt for you, and exploited it. You manipulated me for your own selfish benefit.”
In Jameson’s frequent absence, it had been Soleil who’d kept his bride company. In El’s desperate search for him, Soleil had been the one to clean up the mess. Any request for assistance, the young Whitaker would come running, no questions asked. It’d only been in hindsight that Soleil was just a pawn in Elouise’s game.
“I’m not doing you any more favors. We took care of eachother when necessary. But, that child is not my responsibility.”
Soleil Whitaker 12/11/17 The sudden physical contact is enough to set something loose in Soleil’s composure. “Don’t f*cking touch me,” she seethes. The blonde’s hold is a lot stronger than Soleil remembers, but it’s blatant rage that gives her the strength to yank her arm away.
She glances at the infant, who stirs slightly at the sound of her raised voice. Shaking her head, she continues, more quietly, “I’m done doing you favors, Elouise. Maybe you should’ve taken a second to think before you slaughtered all the people who could’ve taken him.” The comment is intended to sting, and Soleil hopes that El is beginning to get the message.
“We’re finally happy again. I’m not letting your inability to care for another human being f*ck that up.”
Soleil Whitaker 12/11/17 The request of aid hadn’t even come in the form of a question. Rather, it had been a statement, as if Elouise had caught a whiff of the momentary hesitation. Soleil had always been a complete sucker for her best friend, and that dogged devotion had f*cked her in the end.
She traps the words behind her teeth. There will be no bending under El’s charm; Soleil’s jaw sets, hands clench into tight fists. The request takes her by surprise, but it’s pettiness and resentment that first prompt her to reply. Of course Elouise needed help. And of motherf*cking course she had sought out her former right hand man.
Soleil doesn’t wait for a reply because she’s already made up her mind. She’d taken the time to methodically erase every hint of Elouise, the Order, and her time abroad. Absolved of the marital offenses she’d committed against Rhiannon, the young Whitaker had vowed to never initiate contact, or seek El’s company. In this moment, she is still true to her word.
“I can’t,” she states firmly, arms coming up to cross over her chest, “And even if I could, why would I want to?”
Soleil Whitaker 12/11/17 There’s no doubt in Soleil’s mind that Elouise has some kind of plan in place. She’d been sent coordinates, a sign of standard Orlav meticulousness. It doesn’t take long to reach her destination.
Soleil runs a hand through her brunette locks - the platinum blonde had seemed a little too immature for her newly assumed maternal duties. Hazel eyes meeting icy blues for the first time in months. Something’s slightly awry in the woman’s nature, and the unfamiliarity sends a chill down Soleil’s spine. Still, she steps closer.
Straight to the chase. Get in, get out. Every second that passes in the blonde’s intoxicating proximity is a reminder of Soleil’s sins, weakening the still fresh sutures of her restless heart. Her resolve wavers just as her gaze drops, hands shove themselves deep into coat pockets. She inhales sharply, the shock of cold air giving her resolve new fervor.
The call is disconnected before Soleil can even finish the thought. Of course the older woman would have some kind of plan that Soleil would only be privy to in the moments just before it’s implemented. She mumbles, hoisting herself off the couch and up the stairs to change out of her ‘comfy clothes.' It’d been a short conversation, but in just those few minutes, Soleil had been drained of her energy. Typical of any correspondence with Elouise Orlav.
As promised, she receives a text with an address. Keys, wallet, helmet. How pathetic it is that she’s, once again, running to El’s side. But, her guard is up this time. With her family in mind, Soleil is cautious, and hyperaware of the older woman’s tactics - she’s over the Orlav charm.
Soleil Whitaker 11/09/17 Soleil falls silent, taking note of the way El inhales sharply. She listens for Wilson’s steady heartbeat on the floor above, picks up on the sound of a car passing in the street. She feels… weird. Elouise Orlav had always been an enigma to her, not only because she’d kept particular details hidden for the majority of their friendship. But, something in her tone does not sit well with the young Whitaker. Her free hand reaches up to fidget with a lock of platinum blonde hair. She’s not quite sure how to proceed with the conversation.
“I’m tired of all this cryptic, secret bullsh*t, El. I stood by your side for a long time, no questions asked. But, I’m over it. Secrets kill."
Soleil Whitaker 11/02/17 Soleil can’t help but scoff. “You’ve been watching, huh? That’s a lot, Elouise. Even for you.” The young woman had chosen to ignore the fact that she was under constant surveillance in Moscow - it wasn’t a secret that Dr. Orlav and his wife liked to keep the Order’s members in check. But, to know that El had been watching, even after the demise of their relationship, does come as a shock.
“I do know him, actually,” she states, now standing to pace the length of the living room floor, “We’ve had minimal conversation, but we're at least acquaintances."
Soleil knows Elis Griffyn to be a conversationalist, a man of curiosity and quick wit. They’d first interacted during Elis’ ‘Be More Cordial’ phase, and had engaged in a few more polite conversations in the weeks to follow. But, beyond his gentlemanly manner and curious sense of humor, Soleil knows very little of the man.
Soleil Whitaker 10/30/17 “Who told you that?” Soleil asks, shifting to the edge of the couch. Concern is now palpable in her tone. “Elouise, what’re you… what the hell is going on?”
She’s speaking over the other woman, ignoring the affirmation of eternal love Elouise holds in her heart. But, at the mention of Wilson, her train of anxious and worried thoughts come to a screaming halt. “How do you know about Wilson?”
The Whitaker women hadn’t necessarily made the adoption public knowledge. Of course, Margot and Callum knew, but outside of family, very few people knew that they’d finally started a family. Her brow furrows as she tries to recall if she’d ever mentioned it to Elouise before their falling out. She’s been so caught up in her newly acquired maternal duties that all the days had started to blur together. Every day spent with Wilson and Rhiannon feels like an unsatisfactorily small moment.
Soleil blinks. The sound of her voice is enough to make the young Whitaker’s heart skip a beat. It’s different, not quite so… lively. as it used to be. But, it’s familiar enough for Soleil to know, for certain, that she’s speaking to Elouise Orlav.
It comes out as a whisper. She’s frozen with the phone pressed firmly to her ear; she wouldn’t be able to hang up, even if she wanted to. Somehow, her free hand lifts to clasp over her mouth. It’d been weeks since the last time they’d spoken. In fact, their last correspondence had been an expression of regret and disdain for their relationship.
A small part of her psyche is still angry, and Soleil wants nothing more than to let the fire rain down on her former best friend. Why now? Why do you keep coming back? Why can’t you just leave me the f*ck alone? Questions race through her mind. Instead, she lowers herself onto the couch slowly, and takes a stabilizing breath.
Soleil Whitaker 10/27/17 Life is good. Better than good. It’s perfect. After the affair, she’d harbored some pretty nasty feelings for Elouise Orlav. Now, her old life is a distant memory. The life she has now - the one she’s built with Rhiannon - is all she could ever ask for. Over the last few weeks, Soleil has grown comfortable in the routine of being a mother - she has abandoned her late, lazy mornings of television and cat naps. Instead, she wakes when her wife does, showers, brews two cups of coffee, and makes eggs and avocado toast for breakfast. She’s learned to be domestic, to be a homemaker - a role she would’ve scoffed at six months prior to the adoption.
It’s late. Wilson is asleep in his room - Soleil knows because she can hear his steady breath, and rhythmic heartbeat from the living room. She takes a moment, reveling in the stillness of the house. The living room is tidy, the kitchen cleaned top to bottom. The only thing she’s missing is her wife. Her phone rings as she pours herself a glass of wine, and without a glance at the caller ID, she accepts the call.
“Hey, babe. Are you headed home yet? I have an open bottle of wine, and an insatiable craving for you."
Because if you truly love someone - if they really mean that much to you - you don't f*cking betray them the way you betrayed me.
Soleil Whitaker 09/26/17 The young woman freezes. For a moment, her resolve weakens. But, she quickly realizes that even if Elouise is being honest, there is no benefit in falling for her charm. Soleil had done it once, and it almost cost her the life she'd worked so hard to build.
Soleil Whitaker 09/26/17 Soleil is just getting out of the shower when her phone chimes. Curious as to who might be texting her at this hour, she plucks the small device from its place on the window sill. The young Whitaker almost hurls the phone at the adjacent wall, shocked by the name that appears on the screen.
Her grip tightens as she glances at the closed bathroom door. Rhiannon is on the opposite side, still tangled up in their sheets. After the affair, Soleil had made a silent promise to cease all communication with the Orlavs. She’d made an exception when Elouise sent Fish home to New York.
Admittedly, she finds herself thinking of their relationship from time to time. But, Soleil knows that she’d cut off her own arm before she ever reached for Elouise Orlav again. That being said, she types out an noncommittal, yet honest response.
I can understand that. Not a great deal of babies do from what I've heard. I got calming spells though *coughs*
Lucius Dalca 09/16/17 Lucius watched Autumn bouncing off to get food and clothes with a devious grin before checking his phone on the side arm of the couch.
True. I can't help it though. Not many people call pull of ginger but I know I look damn fine. It's no wonder you can't stop thinking about me. I think about me all the time.
Not at all. Would just be cool to hang out but my diary is filling up so wanted to get you into it for this week before it's too late.
ELOUISE PRUDENCE. THERE CANNOT BE A BABY INSIDE OF ME. We literally just had this conversation and Atticus will tie cement blocks to my feet and throw me into the ocean.
I promise not to eat you so long as you don't start looking or smelling like fried chicken. Or scrambled eggs. Or rhubarb pie?
Soleil Whitaker 09/11/17 Soleil and Rhiannon are thrilled to have their three-legged, cuddle loving canine back in New York; the brownstone finally feels like home again. The younger Whitaker sits on the edge of the kitchen counter, watching her wife put away the last of dinner's leftovers. She smiles, the happiness in her heart radiating throughout her muscles and bones. When Rhiannon retreats into the living room, Soleil pulls out her phone.
Out of impulse, she'd told Elouise to cut ties and delete her contact information. Perhaps hypocritically, she hadn't brought herself to do the same. Her thumbs hover over the touchscreen keyboard, poised to tap out a lengthy text expressing her feelings for the woman she'd once called her best friend. Instead, she types the two most honest words she knows.
When you free next? I have a date tonight and another Thursday but I should be able to slip you one in one evening if you're bored and lonely.
I'm bloody waiting, woman. I've done all I can possible be do aside from turn to mist and shimmer to the goddamn airport like some sort of vampire.
I'm always cute. If you're wearing a onesie, I'm forcing you to sit alone in steerage. First Class is for the classy people. Be classy.
Jesus Christ, woman, it's a good thing I have so many air miles. First Class or I'm going home. Come pick me up - I'll grab my travel Scrabble.
Jameson is not going to get to Logan while he is with me. You know that. This might be the safest place for the both of you.
It's whatever you want it to be. I'm not up to much so you can come over if you want and hang out. I'll ping you the address. No robe this time I'm afraid.
I doubt he minded. He adores Logan. He loves babies and kids in general... so do I. Give the little one hugs and kisses for me.
I've not seen many babies in clubs, but that doesn't mean we can't be trendsetters. Japanese are odd ducks and they love things that are kawaii. So like, that should mean Logan is allowed in without question.
Say when and where. I'll be there with my finest 'going out' attire. Spoiler: It ain't much. The good news is drinks will be free all night long.
...oh, me. You're telling me, that's why you texted. Umm fvck yes? It's actually been a hot minute since I had such a good time I forgot what happened.
Elis Griffyn 08/22/17 Elis grins and picks up his boombox, leaving the tequila bottles where they sit.
Elis Griffyn 08/22/17 "Ugh! You don't call, you don't text. How else am I meant to make you like me? I'm on the edge here, Elouise. I'm on the edge."
He drops his hands to his sides and sighs all the sighs a man could sigh in his current predicament.
Elis Griffyn 08/22/17 Oh! He had a plan for this bit too. And as the onesie-clad wonder appeared in the window, Elis put down the boombox and grabbed two packets of Cheetos. With hands securely gripped around the bags, he applied pressure and pop, their contents sprung into the air like cheesy, delicious confetti. He raised his voice and declares...
Elis Griffyn 08/22/17 With a boombox in his hands and tequila in bottles on the floor, Elis Griffyn stood before the doors to The Order and hit play.
Lucius Dalca 08/18/17 Lucius was all but happy to take Logan into his arms and cuddle the tiny baby, "Such a handsome boy" He chuckled softly before answering Elouise, "Moana is a great movie! But why are you showing my newphew the Shining???" His eyes narrowed down at Elouise slightly before laughing again, "Thank you though for the room, Ill take it! We aren't moving from London though we just figured since we are going to be visiting Romania a lot then why not have a house there too, ya know? You can come and visit any time too. Its a bit warmer than Moscow." He paused then grin slightly.
That was a really lovely song. I wish I could hear you sing it. Unfortunately, the hazmat suit I'd be forced to wear in your vicinity makes it rather hard to hear. And, the most important part, I don't actually want to be near you. How the fvck did you get my number? Are you stalking me?
Lucius Dalca 08/17/17 Lucius smiled when Elouise came out with Logan and hugged her back, "She is still in Romania with my folks. She wanted to do more house shopping but asked me to give you a hug and a kiss for Logan for her, which reminds me." He leaned over to give Logan a small kiss on the top of his head, "Hows is my adopted nephew doing??" He smiled wider at the baby then looked back up at Elouise, "I like Moscow. I heard of your invitation and decided to represent the coven. You got a room for me to stay in?"
"I can promise I'm not flirty. Certainly not with you. I believe your leg-hair is longer than mine."
Jameson Orlav 01/01/17 It takes only Elouise's entrance into the room for Jameson to forgo the rest of his work. She finds his lap, curling up easily as she always had. But before he fulfils his duty in the exchange of words, he pulls himself away if only slightly, fingers tucking behind the dip of her neck and thumbs pressing her chin to tip her head in the direction of his own.
Autumn Summers 12/28/16 "You need to be telling your husband that, love, not me, though I am glad you're willing to talk to me about it," she softens the rebuke with her gratitude. Elouise may not be all there, or entirely reliable, but she's still a friend.
Leaning over, Autumn gives the other woman's cheek a kiss. There is nothing beyond a platonic relationship implied in the gesture. It's meant for affection and comfort.
"Indeed you will. Go on home and fix things. I know he adores you, and you him. You've had time to think and cool down. Off with you." Knocking back the rest of her Johnnie, Autumn winks and flashes a cheeky grin. "I promise not to take it personally."
Autumn Summers 12/27/16 Autumn nods. She is not the type to nag. She makes a statement and leaves it up to whomever the words are directed at take them as they will. Elouise is no exception to this.
A faint, answering smile curls her lips. "It's amazing how easily another person can become your entire world, isn't it?"
The hand holding the smoke closes around the glass and brings it to her lips. Proper sips this time, savoring the scotch the way it should be.
"I'm glad you messaged me. If you do ever need a place to escape for a little while, you're always welcome at my house. It's big but just me and Maddie." The smile broadens.
Jameson Orlav 12/19/16 Elouise is laying flat against the floor. It was a good thing she decided to speak up or he would have stepped right on her. Still, Jameson can't help but think that she seems a little off. Her insistence that he sit procures a loosely furrowed brow over his gaze. Its as though she's about to tell him that she has the plague. Or wants to.. leave him.
He shutters as his heart flutters, but he sits. Not flat against the floor, but with his legs crossed beneath him. Then, without warning, she presents her ailment to him. Simply, with no argument or stall. It makes sense to him now. Her anguish. Her mourning.
"El, you're.." Teeth grind blindly against his lip while he tries his hardest to digest, "Is this real? You really are?"
An energy begins to build inside of him, but it does not resemble anger, or bewilderment. He doesn't seem to be ill tempered or disappointed, but simply.. Happy. Happy as a grin spreads across his lips, lighting his eyes as the smile spreads over them. Jameson pounces, his limps wrapping around his wife, squeezing harder than he had realized as laughed into her hair.
Jameson Orlav 12/16/16 Again, he gets another alarming text from Elouise. While she promises no trickery, he can't help but wonder what was waiting for him on the other side of the cell phone. It was just their thing. Playful banter. Frivolous lies. It was all in good fun, usually. But Jameson doesn't jump right away. Instead, he sends a text back;
And finishes up what he is working on, knowing that it won't take him very long. Numbers could always wait, but he's got so much meticulous work backed up on his desk. He would soon need to hire an assistant..
Soon, he finds his way to their suite. The door is open, as it often is during the day when they were around.
"Ellie?" Jameson pushes through the doorway, eyes searching the room for the blonde as he sheds his jacket. "Where are you? What's wrong?"
Jameson Orlav 12/05/16 Did he get to sleep? Of course not. Not when she was out. Not until she got home. Always. Jameson sits up in bed, glasses setting against his nose as he read through his copy of a newly published medical resource journal. Boring? Maybe. But necessary.
Then she busted through the door. Brownie crumbling from her mouth. Eyes bloodshot. Tequila breath invading the room.
"Elouise?" He shuts the book, setting it to the side and throwing the covers from his legs. "What the.." Oh. The how. So Noura couldn't even wait 24 hours to turn his life upside down. "Listen, you're already making this into a bigger deal than it needs to be. Really."
Jameson Orlav 09/22/16 Elouise draws away from their simple embrace and the in sudden lack of connection between thrm, Jameson almost allows a sound of detest to emanate from within his throat. The man brings down soft white teeth against his lower lip for a split second, catching the sound before it falls from his mouth.
She stares at him, waiting for him to break the silence, but he allows it to linger. Maybe longer than Elouise would have preferred, but Jameson doesn't get moments. Not moments of the savoring sort, at any rate. So he would allow them what felt like eons to digest the energy. After all, it had taken them many pranks and morph-child deaths to get here.
"Finally." Jameson's hand moves from the space in her hair and his fingertips are trailing lightly over the delicate skin of her jaw. This is before his hand cups at her cheek, and his thumb begins to rub absently at the corner of her mouth and over her chin. His expression is soft, and his eyes dance wildly. Aflame with amusement. Eagerness. Excitement.
Jameson Orlav 09/21/16 Breathing wasn't on Jameson's mind. He may not have even noticed if he'd stopped. The man is completely oblivious. Had his own breathing become erratic now that he'd initiated an outward display of sorts? When she looked up at him, searching for certainty with those bright eyes of hers, did his own breath hitch?
He couldn't be sure. But what he was confident about was the fluidity of his movement, and the way his reactions to her always seemed to come naturally. Jameson's instinctive way of feeding off of Elouise's energy was filled with nothing if not positivity.
So when he begins to lean forward once more, and his fingers find the mess of blonde tucked behind her ear, he doesn't think twice about allowing them to tangle. One hand finds the curve of her back to pull her just a little closer, and Jameson's touch is more gentle than he seems capable as his hand cradles the nape of her neck. All of his hesitation melts when he finally presses his lips against her own, simple and unassuming.
Jameson Orlav 09/21/16 Curious eyes have dropped to where her hands have reached for the fabric of his jacket, flattening against the leather. A grin may have tugged at the onset of his mouth at the corner almost involuntarily as she spoke.. As it often did. Jameson is a stubborn man, and being such meant he was not normally the type to be read. It seemed much harder for him to hide with this damn quinoa around all the time.
"Yes, fine." Jameson leans against her touch just a little, until her hands wander to the tops of his shoulders, "You do deserve it. Props are in order for your taco enthusiasm and your willingness to dress in matching onesies."
He's rolling his eyes, but he smiles. A toothy, almost goofy grin. He's amused, whole heartedly and without an excuse or a cover.
There's very little warning when Jameson leans in and the inches between them close quickly. He stops when the stubble of his face is brushing against the perfectly smooth skin of her own. In an apparent display of affection, the man nuzzles the very tip of his nose and lips against her cheek, and if she paid close attention, she would feel him smile.
Has anyone ever told you that you're ridiculous!? I mean truly, inexplicably, undisputedly... *trails off*
Children: Abigor&Mya Kravenoff,(Deceased)Scout(Deceased)Twins Marcus & David Venom(14 years old born dec.7)Triplets Dylan,Arya,CC (born 9/3/16),Robert William (August 3,2017)
Marah Danielle St. Claire was born in an aristocratic family of pure blood wolves. She had an older brother Marcus, a twin brother David and a baby sister Rhianna. when she was 5 years old a vampire Master turned her older brother and took him away when she was 10 Marcus came back and murdered her parents. The remaining 3 children were separated never to see each other again.When Dutchie first came to the realm she was a mere 15 year old just a few short months of turning 16. She was alone knowing no one till a man with dark hair and dressed in black approached her handing her his card telling her his name was Knight Kravenoff. She placed the card in her pocket not sure if she would ever need it. A few days passed when she took him up on his offer and gave him a call. He helped her with her problem but their story didn't end there they continued to see each other and one thing led to another and just after her 16th birthday they were wed,Years past and they had 2 children Abigor and Mya. But soon their life would have a messy ending with lies from who he thought was his friend and the death of their children. That was when she found her twin brother David.After her break up with Knight she married Danny Ocean Years later she found out he was the reason for her divorce from Knight. The Marriage was to fail from the beginning and never should have been. He refused to let her go till he died then she was free. A year later she met a nice guy just a year older then her his name was Velkin. They had a good life but then it ended with his death. For months after she believed that she was cursed and never to know love again till Digger Venom entered her life. They had 2 children together twin boys David and Marcus named after her brothers.
The greatest loss of all was the deaths of her sister and brothers and weeks later her husband Digger. Not wanting to go on she was killed but before her death she was turned by a Carpathian Vampire. For 6 years she lived their ways and even changed her name . All was great for years till she met a man . Promises were made then broken. Feeling betrayed and mostly used she left Ireland vowing never to return with hatred of those who lied and deceived her. On her Journey she contemplated death till she came across and old dear friend a fellow wolf. Who changed her mind and returned her to her rightful roots. That of the wolf. Little do her enemies of the real wolf that dwells within her.Now she has returned to LA her City. The city that she had fond memories along with that of heart break. But being back she has managed to run across many of her old and dear friends and some new ones. Also 2 very close friends whom she holds deep in her heart and one of the is the main key to her past. This is a new year with new beginnings where it leads only the fates know for sure. But she does know the road she is on its nothing like the past months that she spent promised and wishing on a false dream. No more lies and no more deceit in her life. She has found the one who accepts her for who she is and doesn't have to pretend and be what he wants her to be. He loves her for her and always has. She is herself again an Alpha Wolf and may god forgive who ever crosses her again.
A lot has happened these past months. The anger she once had for a man is gone. Her first love Angel Knight Kravenoff is back in her life. They have talked about getting back what they lost years ago. And that the love they had is still there. He has helped her with the nightmares that haunt her of Danny Ocean showing her he is dead and gone and cant ever hurt her again.
After a lot of disagreements and hostility Marah found out she was not only a blood Boru from her Grams but her parents were indeed her parents or so she thought till a evil master vampire told her he planted the papers and that her real parents were Marie Reilly and Ronan Boru. She also found out after 7 years He was the one who killed her brothers David and Marcus
Thanks, Marah. No real secret, just a lot of...patience. *she laughs again* Something of which I sometimes lack. But I know you can do!
Dita Morgenstern 09/12/18 [is terrified of children.] I try to avoid them, yes. Lots of things happened when I was a child that makes me avoid them.
Dita Morgenstern 09/04/18 [smiles sweetly.] I don't have many friends, just Miss Dessa, Miss Bree and Miss Maeve. I don't know where Dresden went so ..I just have lady friends. [nods.] And now you! This is so exciting!
LillyEmperium 09/01/18 Hmmmm.... I suppose you're not going to know what happened for you to become popular like this. Congratulations
Dita Morgenstern 08/29/18 [blushes.] Thank you! But I'm sure it won't be necessary. Everyone has been very nice to me so far.
[scrunches her face.] I don't really have any special talents to offer. Maybe I could blind them with my camera flash?
Dita Morgenstern 08/28/18 [giggles at Marah's sigh and her words.] I would never ask! I was just curious.
Dita Morgenstern 08/22/18 [tilts head ..traditional witch?] Oh, of course. Some people don't like to follow traditions do they?
[nervous laughter.] Wow, I never thought of that as a possibility. Dragon scale armor must be cool looking.
Dita Morgenstern 08/19/18 [frowns at the mention of the woman's husband passing.] I'm very sorry to hear, Miss Marah.
Dita Morgenstern 08/19/18 [giggles.] I just didn't think acupuncture with heels would be any fun for him.
[giggles.] Noooo. I made the 'Last Supper' in the flesh. But I can't get the 'Christ' off the wall. He's stuck.
[blinks.] It smells just awful. The Last Supper didn't last. I'm still trying to get the idol off the wall but it's stuck.
Dita Morgenstern 08/18/18 [eyes wide, Dresden has never told her dragons exist.] Dragons? They exist?!
[contemplates if she likes dragons, there's a joke there somewhere.] I don't know if I do, Miss Marah! I've never met a Dragon before! But I suppose I do because I can't judge them if I've never met them before..
LillyEmperium 08/18/18 *hugging her, Lilly smiled*i knew eventually everything would work out. You're father is well, as is everyone else. kinda just out an about right niw
LillyEmperium 07/15/18 there maybe another way, you not lose him. I have most of the books, it should be there.
LillyEmperium 07/15/18 *blinking she looked at her* you mean had. Yes I know of it, as well it's location
LillyEmperium 07/14/18 *Her brow furrowed as she looked to Marah* I felt a return, I knew it was him but he never came where he should have. I knew to an extent of Velkens return, but didn't expect this. A blood curse you say? It is possible, there were dark moments for both my father's. Few very dark ones for Ceph. I may have to approach him to tell exactly what was done... I might have to ask another for help as well. But there is generally a cure for every curse.. Just takes time to find it.
Ciaran_M_Boru 07/13/18 That will be easier said then done but good luck.I dont remember much of him I was young when I met him.
Ciaran_M_Boru 07/13/18 Whats the riddle ? You should see if lilly can help you . Ceph was her blood you k now.
Ciaran_M_Boru 07/13/18 "Dad tried that I should of told him all that was going on. Curses a rent easy to cure you know. Hope it works for you though. Da know about this?"
Ciaran_M_Boru 07/13/18 Oh my god stop! I am not a child that needs protecting .tell me what you want me to know. Why are you covering your arm? -He looks at her-
Ciaran_M_Boru 07/13/18 "I honestly wasnt looking for any one when I came back. I do know of them passing though. I have been to the grave yard for them already. How are you doing?"
Ronan Boru 04/17/18 Do I even ask? congrats on the most wanted. *Ronan looks at her and places the posted down.*
Alrick Ivanoff 03/08/18 "Will come." He said rather eagerly. His cousin had indeed been a busy man to father so much children. The clan would rise once more.
Alrick Ivanoff 03/08/18 Children? There were more out there? Tho was indeed good news to Alrick who stood and sheathed his sword. "Must meet young cousins." He said pulling back his hood showing is bearded face.
Alrick Ivanoff 03/07/18 His eyebrows shot up when she mentioned Angel. Add that she was married to him he drew his sword and drove it into the ground as he knelt before her. Once again he did his best to choose his words. "Angel is older cousin." He said with a bored head. "Is Ivanoffs duty to protect Kravenoff."

Raising the profile of Black women killed by police violence, demonstration forces candidates to address racial injustice
Demanding that pervasive racial injustice and police brutality against people of color be addressed on the campaign trail, protesters with the Black Lives Matter movement interrupted speeches by Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley Saturday evening.
Cutting off O'Malley's prepared remarks during the annual Netroots Nation convention in Phoenix, Arizona, activist Patrisse Cullors described the urgency driving the protest. "Let me be clear—every single day people are dying, not able to take another breath," she said. "We are in a state of emergency. If you do not feel that emergency, then you are not human. I want to hear concrete action plans."
Protesters said they were galvanized by this week's one year anniversary of the police killing of Eric Garner and the suspicious and tragic death of Sandra Bland. During the event, they chanted and challenged the candidates to "Say her name," referring to Bland and other women killed while in police custody, and to "Say that black lives matter."
The action made it clear that the minority vote should not be taken for granted by candidates on the left.

S200 combines nutrient technology and a revolutionary delivery package to convey an effective, next generation stimulant package for the environmentally sound resolution of oil contamination.
S200 is a bioremediation accelerator used for the remediation of hydrocarbon spills, or leaks. It is a non-intrusive, cost-effective remedy for the cleanup of these hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons include but are not limited to gasoline, #2 up to #6 diesel fuel, jet fuels, kerosene, lubricating oils, hydraulic oils and crude oils.
S200 is a thin white liquid and as such can be sprayed with traditional liquid spraying equipment, such as: pressurized sprayers or backpack sprayers. The recommended application rate is approximately 1 to 1 by weight of the S200 as compared to the hydrocarbon being remediated. In order words, use 1 pound of S200 for every 1 pound of hydrocarbon you are remediating.
For applications on water, first, stop the spill and clean up as much free product as possible with skimmers, mechanical equipment, etc. Once that is resolved, apply S200 to the surface of the hydrocarbon/water mixture.
On a square footage application, the amount to use is approximately 1 to 10 pounds of S200 for every square yard of surface area. The amount sprayed is dependent on the amount of hydrocarbon on the surface you are spraying.

FINRA found that Credit Suisse’s suspicious activity monitoring program was deficient in two respects. First, Credit Suisse primarily relied on its registered representatives to identify and escalate potentially suspicious trading, including in microcap stock transactions. In practice, however, high-risk activity was not always escalated and investigated, as required. Second, the firm’s automated surveillance system to monitor for potentially suspicious money movements was not properly implemented. A significant portion of the data feeds into the system were missing information or had other issues that compromised the system’s effectiveness. The firm also chose not to utilize certain available scenarios designed to identify common suspicious patterns and activities, and it failed to adequately investigate activity identified by the scenarios that the firm did utilize.
Brad Bennett, FINRA's Executive Vice President and Chief of Enforcement, said, "It’s critical that firms have effective AML systems in place so that they can comply with their obligations to review and report suspicious transactions, including those involving trading in microcap securities or potentially suspicious money transfers.”
FINRA found that from January 2011 through September 2013, Credit Suisse failed to effectively review trading for AML reporting purposes. The firm expected its registered representatives, who were the primary contact with the customers, to identify and report to its AML compliance department activity or transactions that were unusual or suspicious based on “red flags” described in Credit Suisse’s AML policies. Its AML compliance department was then required to investigate the potentially suspicious activity, document its findings and file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) where appropriate. However, the systems and procedures the firm used to monitor trading for other purposes were not designed to detect potentially suspicious activity in order to cause the filing of a SAR, where appropriate, and the other departments and branches of the firm did not effectively assume responsibility for reviewing trading for AML reporting purposes. For example, the trading of one of the firm’s customers, a New York-based hedge fund, followed patterns commonly associated with microcap fraud, such as depositing and then quickly selling, with the proceeds being wired out of the account shortly thereafter. However, no one at the firm reviewed the activity in the account for AML purposes.
In addition, Credit Suisse’s reliance on representatives to escalate potentially suspicious trading failed to account for the fact that most orders it received from its foreign affiliates came in to the firm electronically and thus were not seen by the firm’s sales traders.
FINRA also found that from January 2011 through December 2015, Credit Suisse failed to effectively review potentially suspicious money transfers. The firm used an automated surveillance system to identify red flags of potentially suspicious activity. FINRA found that the firm failed to implement the automated surveillance system properly, including by failing to ensure that the data that was being fed into the system was adequate and by failing to utilize available scenarios that were applicable to the money-laundering risks presented by its business. Although Credit Suisse self-identified some of the deficiencies and retained a consulting firm to assist in evaluating them, the firm initially failed to devote adequate resources to resolve the issues in a timely fashion, and some of the deficiencies remain unresolved today. In addition, FINRA found that Credit Suisse did not have adequate staffing to review the tens of thousands of alerts the automated system generated in any given year.
Additionally, FINRA found that Credit Suisse’s procedures were deficient as it relates to compliance with the prohibition of the sale of unregistered securities. Certain Credit Suisse customers deposited and sold microcap shares through the firm, which should have raised red flags indicating that the shares were potentially part of an illegal distribution. The firm’s procedures failed to instruct its representatives, prior to executing trades in microcap securities, how to determine whether those securities were registered or subject to an exemption from registration. These failures extended to potentially suspicious trades made in omnibus accounts of the firm’s foreign affiliates. As a result, FINRA found that from 2011 to 2013, the firm facilitated the illegal distribution of at least 55 million unregistered shares of securities. The firm subsequently implemented additional procedures limiting the trading of microcap securities.
FINRA's AML Investigative Unit identified the violations during an examination of the firm. The investigation was conducted by the Department of Enforcement.
In settling this matter, Credit Suisse neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the entry of FINRA's findings.

ROCOCO reconstructs ancestral gene clusters. Given the topology of a phylogenetic tree and the gene orders of the leaf nodes, it calculates optimal sets of gene clusters for the inner nodes. The optimization criterion combines two properties: parsimony, i.e. the number of gains and losses of gene clusters has to be minimal, and consistency, i.e. for each ancestral node, there must exist at least one potential gene order that contains all the reconstructed clusters.
The underlying model, the labelling problem and the method are introduced in [STO:WIT:2009] by Stoye and Wittler. A more recent, extensive description can be found in [WIT:2010]
In the current version (2.0), two sequence-based gene cluster models are included. That means, paralogs in the gene order are incorporated in the model. ROCOCO provides a graphical user interface (ROCOCO-Compare) to compare and explore the reconstruction results. You can load results from different internal nodes or from different gene cluster models to look for similarities or search for specific genes. You can download Rococo-Compare as a jar archive from the dowload page or execute it using the Java WebStart technology.
71So the king and Haman went in to feast with Queen Esther. 2On the second day, as they were drinking wine, the king again said to Esther, What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled. 3Then Queen Esther answered, If I have won your favour, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given methat is my petitionand the lives of my peoplethat is my request. 4For we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be killed, and to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as slaves, men and women, I would have held my peace; but no enemy can compensate for this damage to the king.* 5Then King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther, Who is he, and where is he, who has presumed to do this? 6Esther said, A foe and enemy, this wicked Haman! Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen. 9Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, said, Look, the very gallows that Haman has prepared for Mordecai, whose word saved the king, stands at Hamans house, fifty cubits high. And the king said, Hang him on that. 10So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the anger of the king abated.
20 Mordecai recorded these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, 21enjoining them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and also the fifteenth day of the same month, year by year, 22as the days on which the Jews gained relief from their enemies, and as the month that had been turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, days for sending gifts of food to one another and presents to the poor.

travel books: the Bank of Spain. They came over with the gold shipment. They spent three months counting it, day and ni,(,lit, and then checking the figures. Now they want to go home!" When I asked Sloutski how it would end, he said: " They'll be lucky to get out of here when the war ends. For the present they will have to remain in our hands." A few days before Sloutski told me the story of the cashiers of the Bank of Spain, I had noticed in the Moscow press a list of high Ogpu officials who had received the Order of the Red Banner. Among them were several familiar names. It occurred to me to ask Sloutski what distinguished service had brought them this coveted decoration. He said that the honoured men had been the leaders of a special squad of about thirty trusted officers who had been sent to Odessa in December to work as longshoremen. An enormous quantity of gold had arrived at that time frotn Spain. Stalin would entrust only the highest officials of his secret police with the job of unloading the treasure, fearing that word of it might get out. He made Yezhov personally pick the men for the task. The operation had been surrounded with such extraordinary secrecy that this was the first I myself had heard of it. One of my associates, who had gone on this unusual expedition, described to me the scene in Odessa. The entire vicinity of the pier was cleared and surrounded by cordons of special troops. Across this cleared and empty space from dock to railway track, the highest Ogpu officials carried the boxes of gold on their backs.

Marriage equality is now the law of the land in every state of the United States of America. On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court announced its decision in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges. The Court’s decision guarantees same-sex couples the freedom to marry and the right to have those marriages recognized by every state.
According to the Supreme Court, the Fourteenth Amendment requires all states, including the State of Texas to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and to recognize any marriages that were previously performed out of state.
Before the Supreme Court’s ruling, there was a patchwork of various marriage laws differing from state to state. Some states allowed same-sex marriages, while others had laws in place to prohibit it. The Supreme Court ruled those state laws that prohibit gay and lesbian couples from marrying are unconstitutional, and a violation of the individual rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution.
“In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.”
This judicial decision marks a crucial moment for civil rights in our country. Unfortunately, there are those in our nation and our state, who despite the court’s ruling, are vowing to continue their attempts to restrict marriage access for gay and lesbian couples. It is more important than ever then, to know and understand your rights, and to ensure that you are being treated fairly under the law.
Over the next few weeks, we will be discussing matters that pertain to this ruling in more detail. We will be covering issues such as the right to legally marry, parent-child relationships, spousal benefits, discrimination issues and more. Follow along with us as we discuss the details of this landmark ruling that offers marriage equality to all the couples in our country.
If you are facing discrimination or having difficulty obtaining a marriage license, contact Alexander Law Firm. We will listen to you, discuss your options, and help advocate for your rights.

Niemeyer criticized the process that led to the selection of the site, arguing that it should have been preceded by in-depth study of the urbanization of the region in order to guarantee the organic integration of the fair with the future expansion of the city. He would have also preferred a coastal site. His proposal put forward an entire new city quarter, with the fair as its focal point, accommodating a culture and leisure programme. Between the fair and the sea coast he proposed zones for housing, commerce, sports, entertainment and tourism – the latter forming a link between the fair and the sea – paying particular attention to the problem of housing, which he saw as being debased and subjected to commercial interests.

GRIT 02 examines the death of analogue broadcasting by way of readings from numerous sources describing the process of enclosure on public spectrum, the airways and the cultural diversity it affords humanity. The digital spectrum promises to further the spread of sameness the world over.
Homogeneity means “being similar throughout”. What homogeneity brings to societies is an illusion. Sameness is celebrated. Difference is discarded. It is a monoculture, a folly. Sameness will be our undoing.
GRIT 02 includes extracts from the Frequency Post series curated by Garton for KunstRadio, samples from works by Warren Burt, Pei, Steve Law, Ollie Olsen, Jin Shan and Garton.

Did you collect anything when you were a kid? I was the queen of collections. To give you an idea, I collected rocks from our driveway (kids have simple minds), postage stamps (those things are maybe worth some money now…), Precious Moments figurines, and, best of all, Lisa Frank stickers. For all you roughly 20-to-30-something year-old ladies out there: REMEMBER LISA FRANK??
Lisa Frank stickers were the best because they were ultimate girly. Rainbow colors, butterflies, ponies, and I don’t even remember what else. And stickers, wow. Imagine the profits the Lisa Frank company was making on stickers. Stickers: tiny pieces of colorful, glossy paper with an adhesive back, marked up 300%. Maybe I should get into the sticker business.
Until that day, however, I’ll stay in the cookie business. (And by business, I do not mean to imply that I actually have a cookie business; rather, I just make a lot of them.)
This is another quality recipe from The Cookie Dough Lover’s Cookbook. I’d never even made whoopie pies before, but I’d always wanted to. So naturally, cookie dough whoopie pies seemed like a great place to start.
These are great sandwich cookies because the cookie halves are soft, chocolaty, and cake-like. And the cookie dough center? Can’t go wrong with that.
Mix together until dough is all moistened and no large lumps remain. The mixture should look like thick cake batter (and taste like it too!).
Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until cookies are set. Let cool for a few minutes on the pan before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. They’ll look like rounded, fluffy cake cookies.
Start mixing up your cookie dough filling by beating your brown sugar and butter until light and fluffy.
Throw a dollop of cookie dough filling between two whoopie pie halves, and mush them together lightly until the filling reaches the edges.
Apparently April is National Grilled Cheese Month. I have never heard of this before, but who am I to complain? I love me a grilled cheese sandwich, so I thought I better squeeze this Jalapeño, Cream Cheese, and Cheddar Grilled Cheese Sandwich recipe in before the month officially comes to a close.
There’s something extremely comforting about eating grilled cheese. My grandma used to make grilled cheese sandwiches and soup for us every Sunday after we got home from church. I would always be absolutely staaarving (as children usually think they are) and subsequently thought that a can of Campbell’s soup and a regular grilled cheese sandwich never tasted better.
When my little brother was a toddler, he liked to eat lemons. Scratch that. We liked to give him lemons and watch him make a sour, puckered-up face after tasting the juice. It was so cute. And it wasn’t as mean as you might think, because even though he made the funniest face after sucking on one, he always reached for it again and again. So we weren’t just torturing him. Moral of the story: Lemons are fun to feed to kids.
April 20 at 19:00 we invite you to meet with the artist Noemi Goldberg, who currently resides in Kiev and is preparing for the presentation of the May Svoge project.
Noémie Goldberg’work invites us to think differently our preconceived mental images on space and the subtle distortions of space itself brought about by these preconceptions.
Whether with the façade windows of the Centre Flagey, the building of the Lille Art Cente or then again with the floors, walls and windows of the Maison d’Art Actuel de Bruxelles, the Artist cuts, sticks and traces through the space she invests. She takes over the architectural elements : walls, windows, vitrine, ceiling and floors. Each of her ephemeral installation is site specific. She deliberately blurrs the terms that define space, sets up different circulation through it, suggests new relations within it, troubled, discontinued, spatialities.
Because the primary goal is to be open to different, unexpected spatial experience and to refuse any forethought notion of it, this work is by definition extremely flexible, adapting itself to external criterias i.e. the type of space (its finality, the context in which it exists, the duration of the installation)
A federal judge recently invalidated an ordinance concerning hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, passed in West Virginia last January. The Fayette County Commission’s ordinance banned fracking wastewater from being stored, disposed of or used in the county, except for temporary on-site storage.
The commission argued that county officials are allowed to protect residents’ health and welfare, but Judge Copenhaven ruled that the state has greater authority to manage fracking wastewater. The decision also served as a summary judgment on a lawsuit EQT Production Company filed against the commission regarding the ban and came just before a hearing was set to be held on the case. The commission plans to appeal the decision, according to The Register-Herald.
Frack wastewater contains endocrine disruptors, which are linked to birth defects and certain cancers. Researchers found these chemicals in a Fayette County creek near a storage site owned by a construction company that also sued the commission, according the The Register-Herald.
A June report by The Center for Public Integrity reveals that within the Marcellus Shale gas-drilling region, states have inconsistently regulated the industry’s by-products, which also include sludge, rock and soiled equipment. For instance, the report found intrastate transportation of radioactive sludge to landfills without much oversight. In May, environmental and community groups filed suit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency seeking stronger regulations for frack waste.

In the circumstances that you caught it, it is indeed a trophy. However, at a glance the fish hanging on your wall could look like just a decent overslot. A 30" on fly in skinny water is certainly a trophy for that situation but if i were to go into the surf and throw a few cutbait lines out i could catch several larger.

The King of Slub is a 23oz Unsanforized Japanese Selvedge denim with an extremely slubby uneven texture. A result of low tension weaving techniques, and the use of custom developed irregular sized “King Slub Yarn”. The King Slub Yarn was developed over a 2 year period, as standard Slub yarns could not produce such an extreme three dimensional texture. The yarn is rope dyed with indigo and due to the thickness and irregular shape of the yarn indigo absorption varies from section to section. Over time with wear, as the indigo starts to fade, a wide gradient of indigo becomes visible, and the thickness of the yarn allows for an extreme high contrast three dimensional textured fade. Other details include, contrast stitching, classic red line selvedge id, buffalo leather patch, dark copper buttons and rivets.

We are denim nerds. We use Japanese selvedge denim which is woven slowly and painstakingly on old shuttle looms. Why Japanese? Because they are the only people on earth who obsess as much about denim as we do. Japanese fabric has more character, higher quality and way more soul than modern mass produced denim, and as a result it ages and fades beautifully with wear and wash. We travel to Japan multiple times a year to find new fabrics, working with denim mills to develop crazy things like glow-in-the-dark denim, cashmere blends, raspberry scratch-n-sniff, reflective denim and rainbow fade denim.

My 05 RSVR has developed an annoying habit. Occasionally when I press the starter button, the engine will turn over fine but it won't start, no other symptoms, no lights on the dash. I've tried going into diagnostic mode but there's no codes up. The charging system is fine, the battery is fine. I've taken the tilt switch apart and it seems in good nick, but I can't understand how that could possibly go wrong being as it's only a brass spacer which should sit on a bit of plastic until the bike falls over. I did have an accident where the bike fell onto it's left side a couple of months ago (the wiring to the immobiliser looks ok) and it's done about 48000 miles now.
I had to get trailered home one night last week and the next day when I went into the garage the bloody thing started straight up so I couldn't trace a fault.
So, what could this be? I think the sidestand switch cuts the starter motor, I'm not sure what the immobiliser does & No one will (understandably) tell me how to bypass it anyway.
I can't use it now as I'm never sure it will start up after work. (I'd use my 02 Mille but some berk did a U-turn in front of me last week so that's awaiting the insurance assessor now.) Not having a lot of luck!

As soon as the needle went in, I thought I was going to faint, or puke—or both. I later realized that this was purely a response that I developed because I was afraid and didn’t know what to expect. In other words, it was psychosomatic.
If someone had told me what to expect my first acupuncture appointment, I probably would have had a much more enjoyable experience. Since then, I’ve had dozens of treatments, and never anything that (negatively) affected me like that. Usually, I just fall asleep. And that’s saying a lot – for someone who has taken only a few dozen naps in his entire life.
That’s why I want to share with you some of the most common things to expect when you have your first acupuncture appointment.
I’m a current doctoral student in Chinese medicine, and one thing a professor of mine said really struck me.
I’ll never forget the first time I laughed spontaneously during an acupuncture session. Since I had never experienced anything like that in my entire life, I was pretty afraid and (again) didn’t know what was going on.
After about five or ten minutes with the acupuncture needles in me, I started to feel a little choked up with laughter. You know the feeling where you’re in church, where you have to be quiet, and your parents are glaring at you as your brother or sister tries to get you to laugh?
Because you’re in church and you can’t laugh, you try to bottle in the laughter and it just creates this pressurized feeling, where you feel like you’re going to explode with laughter? The more you try to conceal the laughter, the more the pressure gets, until eventually you just lose it? Well, that’s what it kind of felt like for me.
I tried pushing the laughter down, until eventually, I lost it. I laughed so convulsively that – for 20 minutes – I couldn’t stop, until I had tears streaming down my face. A few minutes later, I fell asleep, and woke up to the acupuncturist asking if I was ready.
I’ve seen this in many other people and patients too. I’ve also had it happen to me one or two more times. Besides laughing, plenty of people start spontaneously crying.
The typical scenario is that the person feels a strange urge to cry, and they don’t know why they’re crying, but tears are streaming down their face.
What’s interesting (regarding how acupuncture releases emotions) is that most of the time, people don’t feel sad. They just can’t stop crying, and they don’t know why.
Of course, the third most common reaction is that people just fall asleep. The strong relaxation response sets in as you feel the tingling and listen to the little white noise machine.
Eventually you drift off, and you start dreaming. If you have a hard time sleeping at night, you may find that it’s really easy to fall asleep in the acupuncture room.
You might be wondering, “Does it hurt? What does it feel like? I hate needles, so why on earth would I let someone put ten or twenty needles into my body willingly??”
Acupuncture needles are not hypodermic (e.g. hollow, in order to draw blood, which generally means they also need to be larger)
About three of them feel slightly sharp when inserted, and within a few minutes it goes away and changes to a feeling of relaxation
As a result, they aren’t designed to even be thick enough to draw blood, they aren’t designed for cutting or slicing, and are a fraction of the size.
Clinically, one study sought to see what the primary side effects were over 3,535 acupuncture treatments and found:
Slight haemorrhage (2.90%) and hematoma (2.2%) which generally just means getting a black and blue welt near an acupuncture point, like a raised bruise.
Another study found pretty similar results as far as “side effects,” went, like bruising, nausea and dizziness, for the most common side effects. 2 2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK185079/ ×
Every once in a while, a scaremonger comes along and says, “Acupuncture is a DANGEROUS practice, look, this one person died from it!”
In the United States, 2016 was a year where research profiled in the British Medical Journal reported that properly prescribed medical treatment is now the 3rd leading cause of death: 4 4. https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/05/03/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death/ × 5 5. https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/05/03/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death/ ×
In their study, the researchers examined four separate studies that analyzed medical death rate data from 2000 to 2008. Then, using hospital admission rates from 2013, they extrapolated that based on a total of 35,416,020 hospitalizations, 251,454 deaths stemmed from a medical error, which the researchers say now translates to 9.5 percent of all deaths each year in the U.S.
According to the CDC, in 2013, 611,105 people died of heart disease, 584,881 died of cancer, and 149,205 died of chronic respiratory disease—the top three causes of death in the U.S. The newly calculated figure for medical errors puts this cause of death behind cancer but ahead of respiratory disease.
Mentioned in a World Health Organization report, the rate of death or serious injury (e.g. organ damage), or a hospital admission from acupuncture mentioned in one observational study of 190,000+ patients was a combined 0.024% . 6 6. http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/88/12/10-076737/en/ × That works out to about 45 people. 7 7. http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/88/12/10-076737/en/ ×
Obviously, there are problems with this information. E.g. we don’t know the reporting standards in Asia (like China), or the rate of adverse events. But inside acupuncture circles, it’s extremely rare to see series injuries or hospital admissions from it.
Most of the time, people tend to feel a deep sense of relaxation, pain relief, buzzing, tingling, and numbness, and every once in a while, a bit of a sharp sensation upon insertion (that goes away after several minutes).
Other than that, most people have a great first experience and begin to crave the feeling of relaxation from acupuncture.

In September 2017, Amazon announced plans to locate a second headquarters in a metropolitan area with at least a million people.[45] Cities needed to submit their presentations by October 19, 2017 for the project called HQ2.[46] The $5 billion second headquarters, starting with 500,000 square feet and eventually expanding to as much as 8 million square feet, may have as many as 50,000 employees.[47] In 2017, Amazon announced it would build a new downtown Seattle building with space for Mary's Place, a local charity in 2020.[48]

I think people mostly think I'm exaggerating when I tell them that for me the fun is in being nominated for awards, not in winning, but overall that's true. [...] I guess it's because I've been an awards judge and have watched what happens (all too often, everyone's second choice wins, because everyone can agree on that), and because the gap between win and lose is so small. I like being nominated -- it makes me feel like I've hit an award-nominated level of quality, and that feels good. Beyond that, it's a horse race and the end result of the horse race doesn't matter. I realise that there aren't a lot of people who feel like this about awards, and I'm also aware that it's easy for me to say, because I've already got my fair share of awards and more, so talking about not caring about the actual winning can sound, frankly, smug. But it's still how I feel. [But I could really use 35,000 euros...]
And this [the Edge Hill] is a good award: there's not enough attention paid to short stories. They're seen as trivial, or not as good as novels. They have that whiff of unreality about them that means that people who only write short stories are always being asked when they will be writing a real book. I've not seen another award given to single author collection regardless of genre.
I write fiction. My latest novel is Zeroes, the first book of the Zeroes trilogy (YA fantasy), a collaboration with Scott Westerfeld and Deborah Biancotti. My novel Sea Hearts is published as The Brides of Rollrock Island in the UK and the US. I've also written Tender Morsels and five short story collections: White Time, Black Juice, Red Spikes, Yellowcake and Cracklescape.
The light bulb for my torchiere light went out a couple days ago. Turns out it’s a weird bulb, so I had to buy it online (at topbulb.com), but then I stuck in the new bulb, and nothing turned on. Turns out the bulb didn’t die (though it seemed that way), the fucking light died!
Then I realized the recently-installed cheap CD changer still doesn’t play MP3 CDs properly. Better than before, but it still skips. And it can’t be a power issue anymore since it’s getting it direct from the battery. Grr. I hate stuff like that. I may just return the damn thing.
Oh yea, and Windows XP crashed while I was recording something off TV for Olivia. Nice. Luckily I rebooted and I think I only lost 2 minutes of commercials from the recording, so no harm there. But still.
On a final breakage note, yesterday I hit CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE by accident went I meant to hit CTRL+ALT+DELETE. When running X, CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE shuts down XFree86 entirely, if you don’t know (while CTRL+ALT+DELETE does nothing–I needed to send that command to my Windows server which I was VNC’ing into). Well, it turns out that somehow, by shutting down X at the wrong time, my Gnome panel’s clock applet wouldn’t start. Had to dig around the error message to find the solution, but in the end I had to copy my root account’s gconf entries for /apps/panel/profiles/default/ and then re-customize my gnome-panel. Havoc sure was right awhile ago when he said gconf can corrupt sometimes. I didn’t listen, and I had to rebuild my panel as a result.
It’s finally done! I have finally managed to get my new and improved pixelmonkey.org site online. I am now fully powered by WordPress and Gallery, two amazing projects (written in PHP) which allow for blog/content management and photo gallery management. I even integrated the two together by having them share stylesheets wherever possible.

The body and neck were stuff on clearance from Warmoth. I think they were real cheap cuz the guitar weighs like 25 lbs. I dunno why I put the dings in it, I was being impatient waiting for my soldering iron to heat up to fix a bad pot in it. Paint is duplicolor covered in glitter from some arts n crafts store.
Do you feel there is a big difference with how ric 12 strings are setup with the bass string first instead of the high octave string first? I'm curious about the differences.

I don't remember noticing any major differences the few times I played models with the octave string first. I have a Guild acoustic 12 string set up that way, but the vibe is quite different from the electric. I would think perhaps the attack would be a bit more clear with the bass string first, especially when picking single string runs and arpeggios

Yeah, I had been jonesing for a 12 string for a while. I would search eBay and look at the oddball brands that came up and was surprised to see Peavey. I think I paid $560 and it's defintely an above average guitar.
I rally like the looks of the old Hagstroms, the ones that look like the II or III, but I wouldn't take a chance on an old 12 without being able to check it out in person first.
The tone controls also affect whether or not the pickups are hum bucking. Tone control all the way up shorts one coil, making it single coil.
I think the neck on your Peavey is probably better than the necks on old Hagstroms. I had a six string Hagstrom III. The necks are really thin.
Chankgeez wrote: I think the neck on your Peavey is probably better than the necks on old Hagstroms. I had a six string Hagstrom III. The necks are really thin.
I've had a handful of 60s Hagstroms and yeah, the necks are toothpicks (I eventually sold all of mine because of that, and I like thin necks), but from what I've heard the 12 string necks are a little more accommodating. Never confirmed it myself though.
I still have all the parts I need to build a guitar, minus the body and a good neck...time to head over to Warmoth
threads like this always fill me with inspiration to build my own custom weird-o-caster that has a bunch of ridiculous options but then I remember that i lack so much patience to do cool shit that I'd likely end up fucking something up.

Dockers in the Jakarta International Container Terminal (JICT) are facing a future of uncertainty after the Indonesia Port Company (IPC) made a deal with global network terminal operator Hutchison Port Holdings to let them operate the port for the next 20 years.
The union has been ignored when it has attempted over the past year to discuss concerns and seek a transparent process.
There has been no open tender for the concession and the process has been rushed even though the existing JICT contract only expires in 2019.
Four workers involved in union activity to voice these concerns were sacked and only reinstated after strike action by the union.
This concession must be cancelled and a transparent process be put in place to handle the situation. IPC also needs to consider JICT Union’s argument that the port should be owned and managed nationally.

Hi Hoang, Im new to unreal modeling. I see you have used Spotlight to get scene litup instead of a Sun light. I have a scene and i am struggling to make it look realistic with the lighting. I would really appreciate your help with that. I can use your TIPS If you can suggest some. Please.!!
I'm sorry to be the bad guy here, but that's no design. It's just a box and so small at times that the camera can barely grasp an usefull view – and that is with a far greater FOV that the human eye. Get out of the BOX and start creating. Real human freindly spaces – providing one knows waht a human really finds comfortable and not it is trained to see as comfortable .Nice imagery should always come second. Please do not take offense as I only add comments where I see potential. All best !
no idea how I found this video but interesting to watch – not quite sure if I like the music choice though 😀

This is beautiful cluster of gleaming pyrite crystals. It comes from the Huanzala Mine in Peru and the entire specimen measures 2.5" wide.
The mineral pyrite or iron pyrite is commonly referred to as Fool's Gold because its metallic luster and pale brass-yellow hue give it a superficial resemblance to gold. In the old mining days, pyrite was sometimes mistaken for gold. Pyrite is the most common of the sulfide minerals with the chemical formula FeS2. Pyrite crystals occur in many shapes and habits. Smaller (druzy) crystal aggregates may give off a beautiful glistening effects, and larger crystals may be perfectly formed, including fascinating cubes, penetration twins, and other interesting crystal forms.

Healthy joints make happy people who move freely. If you or someone you know has osteoarthritis, you’ve witnessed the kind of pain that can derail daily activities.
Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, and it occurs when the cartilage on the ends of your bones wears down over time. The symptoms usually develop gradually. At first, there may be soreness or stiffness that seems more like a nuisance than a medical concern. But paying attention now can help you avoid pain later.
Osteoarthritis, or OA, may also affect the neck, small finger joints, the base of the thumb, ankle, and big toe. The pain may be moderate and come and go without affecting the ability to perform daily tasks. Some people’s osteoarthritis will never progress past this early stage. For others, the pain and stiffness of more severe osteoarthritis may make it difficult to walk, climb stairs, sleep, or perform other daily tasks.
Staying physically active and maintaining a healthy weight are the keys to living well with osteoarthritis. Too little movement can lead to stiffness and weak joints. To prevent and manage osteoarthritis, it’s important to get a good balance of rest and activity each day.
1. Physical therapy. Studies consistently support the benefits of an evaluation by a physical therapist and instruction in appropriate exercise to reduce pain and improve movement.
2. Aerobic, muscle-strengthening and water-based exercises. A good exercise program promotes muscle strength, improves range of motion, increases mobility and eases pain. If you have painful joints, there are a number of ways you can keep exercising and protect your joints. You might explore swimming, water aerobics, chair yoga, gentle yoga and Tai Chi.
3. Weight loss. Maintaining your recommended weight, or losing weight if you are overweight, can lessen your pain by reducing stress on your affected joints. This is especially important to ease pressure on weight-bearing joints such as the hips and knees.
4. Walking aids. Canes and walking poles can reduce pain in hip and knee or OA. Ever seen people hiking with Nordic poles? It’s a different kind of workout that can take some pressure off your joints.
6. Knee braces. For osteoarthritis with associated knee instability, a knee brace can reduce pain, improve stability and reduce the risk of falling.
7. Heat and cool. The heat of a warm bath, heat pack or paraffin bath eases joint pain. Others find relief in cold packs. Still others prefer alternating the two.
8. Medication. Pain relievers, particularly NSAIDs, can be used to reduce inflammation and help get you active enough to exercise. Topical creams are also used to help you move more and ease discomfort.
If you’d like help getting started with a safe exercise program that will strengthen your muscles and protect your joints, contact the Wolfson Health and Wellness Center, Baptist Health and JOI Rehabilitation, or the Y Healthy Living Center.
If you have a joint injury or concerns about long-term osteoarthritis pain, please contact Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute, with locations across northeast Florida.

Charlie is Emma’s room-mate, and they have an undieing প্রণয় for One Direction. Thats all they talk and dream about. Emma is besotted with Niall and wishes one দিন that he would spot her and realise they would make the perfect couple. Charlie on the other hand likes to make Emma think that shes not too keen on Niall, but really she’s just as besotted. Is this the beggining of a tale of heartbreak and break-ups; অথবা the start of a sweet romance. প্রণয় is about making sacrifices; but does Emma really understand any of that.
“Agh, alright then lets go to bed, its gonna be a long night! Here’s hoping for a dream about Niall... as he is ‘dreamy’ after all”
I liked your story and I agree that you should write more!!! Your story was INTERTANING. I like Niall as well but he's not my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you and reading some more of your stories. Once again I really lied your story and I will tell my other friends on FANPOP to read it and let you know what they thought about it. Please write back.

Understanding Correlation & Diversification: Diversification means finding investments with low correlations with traditional stocks and bonds.
Welcome to the latest installment of “Over 90 Percent of What Planned Parenthood Does,” a series on Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona’s blog that highlights Planned Parenthood’s diverse array of services — the ones Jon Kyl doesn’t know about.
You know what they say: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Public health experts agree that vaccines are one of the most important advancements in medicine, and are incredibly safe and effective in preventing infectious disease. Many infectious diseases that used to lay waste to their victims are now unknown to many of us in the developed world — polio, whooping cough, measles, and rabies struck fear in the hearts of our forebears, but most young people today barely know what they are (although low rates of vaccination can still lead to outbreaks, such as 2008’s measles outbreak in Tucson). Smallpox, once a terrifying scourge, has been wiped off the planet thanks to vaccination campaigns.
Vaccines work by introducing antigens to your immune system. An antigen is a substance, such as a protein on the surface of a virus, that the immune system can recognize as dangerous. It is then able to attack the pathogen and, often, create a “memory” of that pathogen so it can attack it in the event of reinfection. The antigens in vaccines are very safe, and can be derived from many sources, such as inactivated (dead) or attenuated (weakened) pathogens, or fragments of pathogens. Some vaccines, such as those protecting against human papillomavirus and hepatitis B, are made with laboratory-synthesized fragments of the surface proteins of viruses, which are sufficient to produce immune response despite being completely noninfectious.
Planned Parenthood Arizona offers vaccinations against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and human papillomavirus (HPV). All three of these viruses can be transmitted sexually, and hepatitis B and HPV can cause cancer if the infections become chronic. The hepatitis vaccines have led to all-time lows in rates of hepatitis A and hepatitis B; the HPV vaccine is still new, but emerging evidence suggests a possible decrease in HPV rates as herd immunity grows. Vaccination doesn’t just benefit you and your partner(s) — it benefits society as a whole. Continue reading →
Hepatitis isn’t commonly thought of as a sexually transmitted disease (STD) — for most people, hepatitis conjures images of contaminated food or unsanitary restaurants. But hepatitis should be on the radar of anyone who is sexually active. There are several different viruses that cause hepatitis, and some can be sexually transmitted, including hepatitis A (HAV), hepatitis B (HBV), and, to a lesser extent, hepatitis C (HCV).
While HBV is most efficiently transmitted through blood, it can also easily hitch rides from person to person via sexual fluids. However, we covered HBV in depth last year in observance of World Hepatitis Day. As May is Hepatitis Awareness Month, we’ll turn the spotlight on HAV and HCV for this month’s installment of our STD Awareness series.
HAV spreads through fecal-oral contact and is more widespread in parts of the world with poor sanitation. It is relatively rare in the United States, although in 2003 there was a hepatitis A outbreak outside of Pittsburgh — the largest in the United States — that was traced to improperly washed raw scallions. All told, there were 650 confirmed illnesses and four deaths. HAV is very resilient and can survive outside a host for long periods of time — other foodstuffs it can contaminate include filter-feeding shellfish, which can concentrate HAV from contaminated seawater in their tissues. When these shellfish are undercooked, they can pack quite a punch as billions of virus particles are released into the unsuspecting diner’s body.
Vaccination against hepatitis A confers lifelong immunity while sparing you from illness caused by a natural infection.
Unfortunately, no matter how well you clean your fresh produce or how long you cook shellfish, certain sexual activities can increase your risk of acquiring HAV. As with intestinal parasites, which can be present in minuscule amounts of fecal matter, so too can virus particles be present in microscopic bits of feces. Oral contact with the anus (“rimming” or anilingus) is the riskiest activity in terms of HAV transmission — oral-genital contact can also do the trick, as can manual contact between the anus and the mouth. While hepatitis A outbreaks have been reported among MSM — men who have sex with men — populations, oral-anal contact is associated with increased risk for HAV infection regardless of sexual orientation. To reduce your risk of sexual HAV transmission, use latex condoms or dental dams during oral activities. HAV can also be transmitted via blood, and hepatitis A outbreaks have been reported among IV drug users. Continue reading →

Common rail injector is one high precision component in diesel engine systems.Its working performance directly affects the power, economy and reliability of the diesel engine.According to the requirement of mixture formation and combustion, fuel injector shall have a certain injection pressure, a certain injection stroke, and an appropriate injection cone Angle.In addition, the fuel injector should be able to quickly cut off the fuel supply when it needs to stop the fuel injection, no oil dripping happen.
Common rail system components are sensitive to the water in the fuel system, especially those components like common rail injector with precision control valve that are lubricated by diesel themselves.Once the water enters the system it may cause problems such as corrosion of components or poor lubrication.Below there are some main faults & problems in the common rail injectors we usually experienced:
When the oil injection pressure is too low, the carbon deposition, spring-end wear of the spring-hole or the drop of the spring force will cause the injector to open earlier, close later, and form an undesirable spray atomization phenomenon.
When moisture or acid in diesel cause the needle valve to rust and get stuck,the cylinder seal cone is damaged, the combustible gas in the cylinder will also enter the matching surface to form carbon deposit, causing the needle valve to stuck, the injector will lose the function of oil injection, causing the cylinder to stop working.
Tip:Remove the injector, take out the injector nozzle and pull out the needle valve with tools. If it is not easy to pull out, put the nozzle into diesel oil for about 20 minutes to be heated before taking it out.
The needle valve moves back and forth frequently in the needle valve hole.Meanwhile the intrusion of impurity pollution in the diesel oil will gradually wear the needle valve hole guide surface, so the gap increases and the scratch mark appears, resulting in increased leakage in the injector, pressure reduced,fuel injection quantity decreased, lag in fuel injection time, causing the engine starting difficulty.When the injection time delays too much, the diesel engine cannot even run.So you need to replace the needle valve coupler.
When the temperature of the diesel engine is low, it is difficult to start, and the exhaust pipes have white smoke. When the temperature of the diesel engine rises, it turns to black smoke.High fuel consumption.
When the common rail injector is working, the sealing cone of the needle valve body will be frequently impacted by the powerful force of the needle valve, together with the constant injection of high pressure oil from the point, the cone will gradually wear or spots, thus causing the injector to drip oil.When the diesel engine temperature is low, the exhaust pipe will emit white smoke, and when the diesel engine temperature rises, it will become black smoke.Check whether the movement of needle valve is flexible and the cone should be free of wear.Or you need to change one new common rail nozzles.

Very often I receive or send an introduction email to two parties, either for a general introduction or to help solve a specific problem. Usually it’s the two parties being introduced who need to chat, and not me. So I do what I’ve seed to be the common pattern and asked to be moved to bcc so that when they hit reply all I am taken out of the chain. I also do the same when someone introduces me, and It’s clear that the introducer shouldn’t be in on the continuing email chain.
Today however I received an intro email from angel.co (Angle list’s return email) and in the email they did something very clever. their email is below. When I hit reply all (which I did lazily as a guaranteed way to include the other person in the email) there was no sign of the angel.co address in the to or cc fields.
They did this by manipulating the reply-to header in the email chain. It may be an old hack or an old trick, or even part of the design of the email standard to begin with. But I’ve never manipulated the reply-to field before and this is absolutely a great way to handle emails connection between two users. Not only is the other part in the email chain, and the send is not on reply-all, it also works for regular reply. Here is an edited version of the headers. I also noticed that mail was processed by SendGrid, so maybe this is actually a feature of sendgrid’s email management service, but in any case, I think it’s brilliant and clever.

The ruby csv library requires quite a bit more typing, and the documentation for it is easy to misunderstand.
One of my primary needs, is often data wrangling. Changing the contents of a csv file for use in another framework, whether it’s reverse coordinates, stripping unwanted columns, or adding needed columns to the data, and I always trip up on how to dump the changed CSV after manipulating it.
As a reminder to myself, and maybe a hint to others, I’ve include the proper way to dump out your arr_of_arrs, once you’ve manipulated it as you will,
The important bit is remembering to do an each loop of your arr_of_arrays object. This for instance will not produce the desired results:

I’m calculating over 1000 travel startups in the last decade with less than 50 ‘successful’ startups.
It may be too early to tell, but I essentially agree with this post on Pando Daily from a few months ago. Travel was one of the early candidates for a market that could be disrupted by the creation of the Internet. There are several very profitable companies that have fundamentally monopolized the space. In the US Market, there is Expedia (created by Microsoft in partnership with GDS’s) 1996.
Orbitz.com (created by United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines & Northwest Airlines in 1999). Two of Orbitz’s founding creators no longer exist. Travelocity.com was created by Sabre (a GDS) which was wholly owned by American Airlines at the time. Priceline.com was founded by Walker Digital (a very successful company with over $300M in revenues in 1998).
So of the big 4 Online Travel Agencies in the US, none represents what we typcially consider a startup, and 2 were actuall existing players in the market just shifting from offline to online.
If you look at the last decade, there a few very successful companies but very few that started in a dorm room. Kayak was started by Paul English (an exec at Intuit) and Steve Hafner who was part of the original Orbitz team. They started with a ton of funding and industry experience.
ITA Software was essentially a true startup. It slogged along in the “Might Make it” status for 15 years before getting snatched up by Google. Granted they had > $100M in revenues and > $200M in funding for many of their final years, but with a limited supplier chain and colossal failures in attempting to scale from Shopping Engine to PSS provider there was never going to be any future other than an acquisition for ITA. Still an $800M acquisiton deal is clearly a SUCCESS.
Farecompare has done very well (founded by Rick Seaney & Graeme Wallace from work they did at Hotels.com)
Flightcaster (Evan Konweiser, ex-kayak staff member) was purchased by NextJump. I’m not sure NextJump is successful, but I guess I count this as a good exit.
More recently there is Gogobot (too soon to tell whether it will last, but it has strong user growth)
Sidestep and Swoodo, both acquired by Kayak can probably also be considered true startups that succeeded by getting acquired. ($200M for Sidestep, unknown for Swoodo). But now we’re venturing outside the US Market where there are a few other notables:
Skyscanner (11 years in the making, started on the backs of 3 guys, 2 of whom kept their fulltime jobs for a while)
There are many more notables like ClearTrip.com from India, but the point I’m trying to get it is this:
In just 2010-2011 Tnooz lists in excess of 300 startups in the travel space, only Gogobot and Hipmunk from that era are surviving at any significant level of success.
The era of the Travel startup may be over. The cost of creating a startup in other areas is just too low, and trying to disrupt the travel space without serious connections and money is seeming less and less likely. I’m not sure if developers will ever stop trying to tackle this space, but it’s certainly beginning to seem less and less likely that they will succeed.
Want to mention some other companies that you think qualify as ‘successful’ travel startups? Send me a note or comment and I’ll update my post.

I’m always astonished by the articles that discuss startup failures. There are many definitions, but in the tech community. If you’re not fully funded or have overwhelming user acquisition momentum within the 1st 12 months, you probably fall in the FAILED category. This one doesn’t attempt to cover the whole 90% statistic, but looks at a few side by side cases. Worth looking at.

I am subscribed to The List Serve, it’s a service where 1 member writes 1 email that we all receive each day. Content tends to be very advice oriented, “never give up, pursue your dreams, be happy”. Sometimes it’s confessional. Sometimes it’s instructional. Often it’s insipid. But I still skim it everyday and today there was a Gem so I’m re-posting it here without permission.
So the story goes…..A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold that the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. The dung was actually thawing him out!
He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing under the pile of cow dung and promptly dug him out and ate him.

Julie Pura lived in very humble circumstances in the Philippines as a bag weaver and a mother of six children. Julie's village did not provide a large enough market to make her bag trade sustainable, so the family had many unmet needs.

With her first payment from Elevita, Julie was able to cement the dirt floor in her hut and purchase a motor scooter, her family's only mode of transportation. Julie even hired other needy women to help finish her bags, sharing the wealth. It is this kind of domino effect Elevita hopes for when contracting with rural artisans. Well done, Julie!

Does bidding aggressively on its way to your most competitive keywords increase conversions on that traffic quality? Or double opt-in however is it just like there was a waste of money? What your thinking it happens when you in the first place high bids on your page show a really specific keyword? What your thinking it happens when you can configure to target that near-synonym that but more importantly you're not quite sure that these platforms will work? If they want what you've never had some troubles with the guts to try, the ACE tool lets you see where you experiment safely. Have on your metrics you always gone for popups forms on the long tail? Try reaching out to a really short, obvious keyword you are trying to see what happens.

It's said for testing tools that calls to take an immediate action which use these plugins because the word "get" are one of the more powerful. Test group members and this theory!

There are two large parks in Haida Gwaii, formerly called the Queen Charlotte Islands; Naikoon Provincial Park on Graham Island in the north, and Gwaii Haanas National Park on Moresby Island in the south. The third and only other provincial park in Haida Gwaii, Pure Lake Provincial Park between Masset and Port Clements, has no camping facilities.
Naikoon Provincial Park gets its name from a corruption of the Haida word ‘Naikun’ meaning long nose, which was the Haida name for Rose Spit, one of the most prominent features in the park. Tow Hill, formed of volcanic rock, which solidified about 2 million years ago into faceted basalt pillars, rises from the flat bogs of the Argonaut Plain at the mouth of the Hiellen River. With an elevation of 435 ft, the top of Tow Hill is almost the highest point in the park. The interior of the park remains undeveloped. The northern edge of Naikoon Provincial Park is a long stretch of sand beach, dunes and surf. Agate Beach Campground, located near Tow Hill, has picnic tables, fire pits, outhouses, drinking water and a roofed kitchen shelter. The campsite is open year round. There are also three small shelters along the east coast of the park. Naikoon Provincial Park is 22 miles (35 km) north of Skidegate.
Misty Meadows Campground, located near the Naikoon Park headquarters in Tlell, south of the Tlell River, offers picnic tables, piped water, covered cooking shelter and toilets, all within a short walk of the beach. A camping fee is collected.
Masset Recreational Vehicle Park, located on the east side of Masset on Tow Hill Road, offers vehicle sites overlooking the Delkatla Wildlife Sanctuary. Power, TV hookups, flush toilets and showers are available. A fee is collected, and the park is open year round.
Hayden Turner Park on the west side of Queen Charlotte City offers fairly primitive vehicle/tent sites, plus several walk-in campsites and a nice beachwalk.
Kagan Bay Forest Service Recreation Site, just west of Queen Charlotte City, has beautiful user-maintained campsites in Kagan Bay, with picnic tables and toilets. The campground is located 3 miles (5 km) west of town on Honna Forest Service Road.
A private forestry road leads north from Queen Charlotte City, and then west across Graham Island to the west coast, and a pair of Forest Service campgrounds on Rennell Sound. The Cone Head Forest Service Recreation Site has space for vehicles/tents, and is about 9 miles (15 km) north, past the Rennell Sound Forest Service Recreation Site. Rennell Sound is the only point on the west coast accessible by road, but the final descent from the alpine down to the shore is a startling 24% gradient, one of the steepest public roads in North America. The Hill is not suitable for large campers and trailers. Check your brakes before making the steep descent down to the coast. The rugged coastline, great hiking and excellent fishing make the trip to Rennell Sound well worthwhile.
Across Skidegate Inlet on Moresby Island lie four Forest Service campgrounds. To find them, drive 9 miles (15 km) east from the ferry landing at Alliford Bay to Sandspit. Follow the main road south from there as it leads to two Forest Service campgrounds on the island’s more sheltered east coast. The Gray Bay Campground 13 miles (21 km) southeast of Sandspit has two locations and space for vehicles on the gorgeous beach south of Sandspit. A smaller, vehicle campground on Sheldens Bay is located about 7 miles (11 km) farther south.
Southwest of Alliford Bay is the vehicle recreation site on Mosquito Lake, 27 miles (44 km) from Sandspit, which offers a boat launch, a day-use area and excellent trout fishing. At the head of the Cumshewa Inlet is the vehicle campsite at Moresby Camp, 4.5 miles (7 km) beyond Mosquito Lake. Moresby Camp is the favoured location to launch small boats and kayaks to explore the Gwaii Haanas/South Moresby Park Reserve, and offers good Coho and Spring salmon fishing in the fall.
Elsewhere in Haida Gwaii, camping is not organized. There are no formal campgrounds in Gwaii Haanas National Park (managed by both Parks Canada and the Council of the Haida Nation), because there is no road access to the park. The park was formed in 1987 amidst a tense confrontation that divided the island’s population, as well as public opinion across Canada and around the world. There are perhaps only 6,000 permanent residents in Haida Gwaii, but 3 million people pledged their support to see logging stopped in this area. At the height of the confrontation, 72 Haida were arrested and charged with criminal contempt of court, an act that shocked the international community. In a gesture of good faith, the Canadian government passed a resolution to support the Haida’s wishes, and Gwaii Haanas was formed.
Random camping is the rule in Gwaii Haanas. You camp where you please, preferably on sand or stone, or wherever else you will have as little impact as possible. Camping is not permitted at T’anuu Village, or on Gandla’kin (Hotspring), Ata Naa (House), Copper, Jeffrey, Rankine, or Skung Gwaii (Anthony) Islands, or Slug Islet. These areas are particularly sensitive cultural sites or important bird-nesting areas. If in doubt, ask at any of the Watchmen base camps. There is no camping at any Haida Gwaii Watchmen site in the park except for Windy Bay, or Hik’yaah, where the stand against logging was taken by the Haida Nation back in the 1980s.
Visitor Centres are located in the Sandspit Airport and in the village of Queen Charlotte City on Wharf Street. Both centres have a trip planning area with marine charts and topographic maps to assist you in planning your route, and a marine VHF radio to check the weather and sea conditions. The centres operate from May 1 to September 30.
The officce of the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site is located in the Haida Heritage Centre at Kaay Llnagaay in Skidegate.

And then every now and then a flathead comes along. What a big fight for an average size flattie ! He thinks they look bigger holding then upright but they gotta be about 25-30lbs for that statement to be true.
Not only can Varina High School football team hire good coaches, they also know a thing or two about fishing in the winter on the Mighty James River. Remember - it's always 72 degrees on the Catfish Cadillac. I should say and it's true all 3 pics look like different fish but this fish weighed in at 48lbs. Not a fifty or 60 but give em about 12 months and he'll pull even harder.
Deonta Gail is the MAN holding the fish and he also had a 32lb and a few dinks. His personal best to say the least !
- - - - - -did I mention it was a 24 ft Sweetwater Pontoon from Southeastern Marine that is made to fish in.......full curtains covering amost 90 sq ft of nothing but pure HEAT in the winter time - - -

Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species website, we are grateful for your input.
Taxonomic Notes: Two forms previously treated as subspecies or synonyms of M. basilaris are currently recognised as distinct species: Handbag Totes Messenger Ecotrump Women Shoulder Bag Yellow Shopping Casual Crossbody Canvas M. nigripectus (Sélys, 1879) and M. kricheldorffi (Karsch, 1891); however there is not universal agreement that these should be treated as distinct species, although they are treated as such here. A subspecies M. b. japonica (Förster, 1897) occurs in Japan.
Matrona basilaris is widespread in China and north Viet Nam at least, capable of surviving in secondary forest habitats and well represented in protected areas. For this global assessment Least Concern status is justified for the species.
Range Description: As currently recognised Matrona basilaris basilaris occurs at least in north Viet Nam and China (Hämäläinen 2004), where there are records from Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Guandong, Guangxi, Hainan and Yunnan. The exact distribution of the species is not entirely clear due to taxonomic problems. M. b. japonica occurs in the Ryukyu Islands.
Ecotrump Yellow Canvas Handbag Bag Casual Women Shopping Messenger Totes Crossbody Shoulder Population: This is a common species in suitable habitat in much of China at least.
Major Threat(s): Habitat loss; this species is threatened by deforestation. However M. b. basilarisEddany Eddany Pin Ten Pin Tote Canvas Ten Bowling Bag Bowling champion tAnAprZqxB is still a common species in much of its range, capable of surviving in secondary forest and well represented in protected areas.
Conservation Actions: There is a need for further distributional data, and for the resolution of taxonomic issues. Beyond this M. basilaris does not appear to need specific conservation measures across most of its range, apart from monitoring of populations to check for any decline.

It's Only a Matter of Time Until Israelis and Americans Decide to Test the Syrian S-300 Air Defences
My childhood was very nomadic, living in a new place about every year or so, and I had to learn to adapt quickly to new situations. From my beginnings in the south , I was always observing my surroundings and compiling visual references.
My socioeconomic level forced me to be resourceful and creativity was encouraged, especially sewing. Early on I was entranced by fabric and textiles, and now print and pattern have become my ongoing obsession. My textile focus is splatter painting, discharge dyeing and marbling.
My years as an art teacher allowed me to see the imaginative way that children create without fear. I'm a daydreamer and I see the world through the eyes of my inner child.
I love the expressive form of fashion and interiors, and have a special affinity for Scandinavian design. I sew and create almost every day, and I love to teach and inspire others to make things. I am now an 'empty nester' and live with my hilarious husband in middle America. We also collaborate on art and home decor projects together for our brand FORTRESSco.
In this time of trial we need to be encouraged and comforted by one another. The temptations of Satan are greater now than ever before, for he knows that his time is short and that very soon every case will be decided, either for life or for death. It is no time now to sink down beneath discouragement and trial; we must bear up under all our afflictions and trust wholly in the Almighty God of Jacob. The Lord has shown me that His grace is sufficient for all our trials; and although they are greater than ever before, yet if we trust wholly in God, we can overcome every temptation and through His grace come off victorious. {EW 46.1}
If we overcome our trials and get victory over the temptations of Satan, then we endure the trial of our faith, which is more precious than gold, and are stronger and better prepared to meet the next. But if we sink down and give way to the temptations of Satan, we shall grow weaker and get no reward for the trial and shall not be so well prepared for the next. In this way we shall grow weaker and weaker, until we are led captive by Satan at his will. We must have on the whole armor of God and be ready at any moment for a conflict with the powers of darkness. When temptations and trials rush in upon us, let us go to God and agonize with Him in prayer. He will not turn us away empty, but will give us grace and strength to overcome, and to break the power of the enemy. Oh, that all could see these things in their true light and endure hardness as good soldiers of Jesus! Then would Israel move forward, strong in God, and in the power of His might. [47] {EW 46.2}
God has shown me that He gave His people a bitter cup to drink, to purify and cleanse them. It is a bitter draught, and they can make it still more bitter by murmuring, complaining, and repining. But those who receive it thus must have another draught, for the first does not have its designed effect upon the heart. And if the second does not effect the work, then they must have another, and another, until it does have its designed effect, or they will be left filthy, impure in heart. I saw that this bitter cup can be sweetened by patience, endurance, and prayer, and that it will have its designed effect upon the hearts of those who thus receive it, and God will be honored and glorified. It is no small thing to be a Christian and to be owned and approved of God. The Lord has shown me some who profess the present truth, whose lives do not correspond with their profession. They have the standard of piety altogether too low, and they come far short of Bible holiness. Some engage in vain and unbecoming conversation, and others give way to the risings of self. We must not expect to please ourselves, live and act like the world, have its pleasures, and enjoy the company of those who are of the world, and reign with Christ in glory. {EW 47.1}
We must be partakers of Christ's sufferings here if we would share in His glory hereafter. If we seek our own interest, how we can best please ourselves, instead of seeking to please God and advance His precious, suffering cause, we shall dishonor God and the holy cause we profess to love. We have but a little space of time left in which to work for God. Nothing should be too dear to sacrifice for the salvation of the scattered and torn flock of Jesus. Those who make a covenant with God by sacrifice now will soon be gathered home to share a rich reward and possess the new kingdom forever and ever. [48] {EW 47.2}
Oh, let us live wholly for the Lord and show by a well-ordered life and godly conversation that we have been with Jesus and are His meek and lowly followers. We must work while the day lasts, for when the dark night of trouble and anguish comes, it will be too late to work for God. Jesus is in His holy temple and will now accept our sacrifices, our prayers, and our confessions of faults and sins and will pardon all the transgressions of Israel, that they may be blotted out before He leaves the sanctuary. When Jesus leaves the sanctuary, then they who are holy and righteous will be holy and righteous still; for all their sins will then be blotted out, and they will be sealed with the seal of the living God. But those that are unjust and filthy will be unjust and filthy still; for then there will be no Priest in the sanctuary to offer their sacrifices, their confessions, and their prayers before the Father's throne. Therefore what is done to rescue souls from the coming storm of wrath must be done before Jesus leaves the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary. {EW 48.1}

On June 22nd the Queens Park Commissioner, Dorothy Lewandowski and Sunnyside NYC Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer announced the re-opening of what most of us know as the Lou Lodati Playground in Torsney Park in Sunnyside. Over the past two years, a number of renovations have been made to renovate the park facilities, and a dog run was added to accommodate a growing dog population in the Sunnyside neighborhood.
This story includes a brief description of some of the changes made to the park, including a few before and after renovation photos. But this story primarily delves into the story of the man after whom the playground was named in 1999 - Sunnysider & one of the Lowerys Wine & Liquor founders: Lou Lodati. The Lodati story is about early 20th century immigration to America, about the evolution of the wine business in the borough and nation, and about an evolving Sunnyside community.
The photo to your right was taken circa 1937 when Lowerys Wine & Liquor store opened to the public. In the photo from left to right are Alfred & Louis Lodati, Albert Garbarino [Maria Lodati's husband], Valentino Simone [Philomena Lodati's husband] and Anthony Lodati.
July 14, 2013 / Queens Borough / Bronx Neighborhoods & Bronx History / Bronx Art & Culture NYC / Queens Buzz NYC. Continued.
Two years ago, in early June 3rd of 2011, the Queens Parks Commissioner, Dorothy Lewandowski, and City Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer came to the Lou Lodati Playground to announce changes planned for the park.
In the photo shown to the right and in the slide show below, you can see the plans which included a new dog run to accommodate a fast growing Sunnyside dog population as well as upgrades to the baseball diamond, the addition of volleyball courts, the movement and accommodation of the basketball half courts and improvements to the seating area adjacent to the kids playground. On June 22nd, 2013 these same government officials returned to formally unveil the playground improvements upon which the city spent approximately $1.5 million.
I began my inquiry some time ago, and over the years picked up little bits of information here and there, the sum of which is presented herein. As mentioned in the introduction, this story is a mix of the history of early 20th century Italian immigration to America, a very brief account of the development of the wine business, and a small window into the evolving community life and institutions of Sunnyside over the past century.
Louis Lodati was Dominick and Antoinette Lodato's son [see photo to left - Lou Lodati in the 1990's]. Dominick Lodato and his wife Antoinette were born in a small village named Cava de' Tirreni near Salerno, in the Campania region of Italy [see map below right]. Salerno is about 30 miles south of Naples and about 150 miles south of Rome. And the Campania region is well known as food and wine country - even to this day.
The Campania region's reputation for food and wine goes back centuries and likely millenia. The region has rich fertile soil, some of which is comprised of the volcanic ash of Mount Vesuvius. Fine vineyards and wines evolved with the passing of time and Campania cuisine was influenced in part by periodic invasions by the French. The region is well known for its Neapolitan pizza, spaghetti puttanesca, great tomatoes, grapes, red peppers, lemons and fish. Luigi [aka Louis] Lodato was born to Dominick and Antoinette in the cultural milieu of Campania Italy in 1908, and he lived in the village of Cava de' Tirreni until 1916, at which time his parents emigrated to America.
The vast majority of the 19th and early 20th century American immigrants came from the German Empire, the Austria-Hungarian Empire, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, Russia and Scandinavia. It's been estimated that nearly 30 million immigrants came to America in the century leading up to WWI. And the Lodatos entered through Ellis Island, like many of the other nearly three and a half million Italian immigrants that came to America during the early part of the 20th century.
In the early part of the 20th century about 600 American government officials would process about 5,000 immigrants per day. In 1907 a law was passed to limit the number of immigrants passing through Ellis Island each day. The 600 government officials working on Ellis Island, included about 100 medical personnel, about 50 interpreters and the remainder of the government workers included security, administrative and sanitation personnel.
While passing through the immigration process at Ellis Island, a government official asked Dominick Lodato if his name was Lodati. Dominick's command of the English language wasn't very good at the time and he nodded his head affirmatively - hence the family name was thereafter changed to Lodati.
In the photo above left are Antoinette [Baino] and Dominick Lodati in the 1920's. In the photo above right are the Lodatis and their children Louis, Anthony, Alfred, Maria and Philomena.
Dominick and Antoinette Lodati first moved to Waterbury, Connecticut along with Dominick's seven brothers and sisters, before eventually settling down in the Long Island City / Sunnyside neighborhood. Dominick found a job in the Astoria Chiclets Gum Factory, while Antoinette took care of their five children: Louis, Anthony, Alfred, Maria and Philomena.
In the 1920's, as Dominick and Antoinette Lodati were settling into the Sunnyside neighborhood, it was comprised primarily of Irish immigrants with some Jews [there was a synagogue on 41st Street] and some Italians spread throughout the neighborhood. The subway between Queens and Manhattan had opened in 1917, enabling working class people to buy homes in Queens and work in Manhattan.
Sunnyside Gardens was erected from 1924 - 1928 with the support of Eleanor Roosevelt who was the New York Governors wife. The model for the new development was to incorporate open space into urban development.
The Prohibition ended in 1933. During the 1930's and 1940's, most of the wines consumed in America were primarily from the European countries, most notably Italy, France and Germany. And as Italians, the Lodati's cultural knowledge of wine made them well suited to become knowledgeable wine vendors.
At the age of 21, shortly after the Prohibition ended in 1933, Louis Lodati and his brothers [Alfred and Anthony] opened a store that sold cordials. Cordials are a strong sweet liqueur. The shop was opened on Queens Blvd between 39th and 40th Streets, within a block of where they would subsequently open Lowery's Wine and Liquor store in 1937.
They named the wine and liquor store Lowery's after the #7 subway line stop at 40th Street in Sunnyside. At the time, there was a Lowery's Bakery Shop, a Lowery's Hardware Store and a Lowery's Drug Store. Only the bakery has survived along with Lowerys Wine & Liquors, although the bakery goes by another name and is under different ownership. See photo in story introduction of the three brothers in front of the Lowerys store not long after it had been opened.
In the photo above right are the three Lodati brothers [sons of Dominick] at an Italian Charities event. Anthony Lodati [far left], Alfred Lodati [third from left] and Lou Lodati is on the far right.
Lowerys Wine & Liquors started out as a one store front shop and later expanded, taking over the store next to it. During the expansion, Lou Lodati hired some local Italian craftsmen to install store wall shelving that made the store reflect an ambiance of a fine wine cellar of a vineyard [see photo at left]. They built finely crafted oak shelves that were assembled without nails, and still have the solid oak look, feel and finish, even to this day.
Next door to Lowerys Wine & Liquor store, members of Antoinette Baino's family [Louis's mother] opened a bar which they gave one of the family names: Cassel's. Cassel's bar was run by the Cassel family for many years before it was sold sometime in the late 20th century. The Lodati's and the Cassel's planted deep roots in the Sunnyside community as their families grew up in it. The three sons of Dominick - Lou, Alfred & Anthony [see photo at beginning of story] worked the wine and liquor store, while their sisters and wives raised the children. Over time some members of the Lodati family pursued other jobs in the wine and liquor business such as working for wholesalers as salemen.
I met a wholesaler / distributor on one of my visits to Lowerys while preparing this story. He carried with him an old black and white photo of his father who had also worked as a salesman in the wine and liquor business. Over the years, Queens family wine and liquor distributorships have been bought up by larger entities. The salesman told me that the distributorship his father had worked for, Alpine, had been purchased by Empire Merchants many, many years ago. In the photo to your right is Salvatore (Tuttie) D'Angelo circa 1950 standing in front of the cargo entrance of his wine & liquors distributor truck.
In the 1950's the wine market in America began to change. Companies like Gallo had taken it upon themselves to grow great grapes on California soil and produce wines which they could sell at prices affordable to the average American. By the 1960's American wines were gaining ground on their European counterparts, and by the 1980's American wines had achieved near parity status with respect to making quality wines.
In the 1980's and 1990's, South American, Austrailian and New Zealand wines began making inroads into the American market, helped by favorable foreign exchange rates as the strong dollar enabled them to provide great value to the American consumer. This phenomenon persists on a much smaller scale today. But the quality of these regional wines has improved significantly, following a trend started by the California vintners in the 1950's to make competitive world wines. Today Lowerys Wine & Liquors buys and sells wines from around the world and their store reflects the now global nature of the business.
Over the past 30 to 40 years the family collected promotional mirrors which hang from the walls, given by the wholesalers as promotional prizes. The mirrors reflect a blend of the art and history of the wine and liquor business over the past quarter decade. We have included some photos of the mirrors in the slide show below. In the photo to your left is one of the mirrors, showing Willie Mays of the New York Giants, which hangs on a store wall at Lowerys Wine & Liquors. Lou Lodati was a huge baseball fan.
As the wine business grew, so did the Lodati family. All five children of Dominick Lodati became parents themselves. During this time Lou Lodati also became actively involved in the governance of Sunnyside, by helping to form the Sunnyside Chamber of Commerce in 1947 along with other community leaders such as Joe Sabba, Publisher of the Woodside Herald; Ed & Mary Lynch of Lynch's Funeral Home, and Henri X. Billharz of Harz Plumbing. All of these family run businesses are still operating today, with Lynch's Funeral Home on Queens Blvd, Harz Plumbing is on 47th Street next to the Anorac Democratic Club, and the Woodside Herald is on Greenpoint Avenue.
As early as in 1951 a dinner was held in Lou Lodati's honor by the Sunnyside Chamber of Commerce in recognition of his contributions to the community. In the photo above you can see other community leaders like Ed & Mary Lynch of Lynch's Funeral Home, Joe and Sylvia Sabba of the Woodside Herald, and possibly Henri X. Billharz of Harz Plumbing on 47th Street.
The Sabbas, Lynchs, and Billharz are shown in the photo above. We have isolated them in close ups in the slide show below.
It's worth mentioning that Joe Sabba founded the Sunnyside Drum Corps in 1946 and Henri Billharz founded the Sunnyside Kiwanis Club in 1947 with the support of Lou Lodati. All of these people joined together to help each other create some of the Sunnyside institutions that continue to this day. The Sunnyside Kiwanis Club is dedicated to helping those less fortunate than the members.
Lou Lodati's kids remember him as a tireless worker, spending twelve-hour days in the store, nearly every business day. They remember how he helped organize and run many civic charities to raise money for those in need.
An example of this sort of community charity work showed up in a photo [at left and see slide show], where a number of the community leaders got together to help the family of a young boy who had lost his leg in a car accident. They raised money by pumping gas, checking the oil and putting air in the tires of customers at the 43rd Street Mobil gas station, [which still stands to this day] and raised enough money to buy the young lad a prosthetic leg. Over time, because of his civic involvement, Lou Lodati came to be known as the unofficial 'Mayor of Sunnyside'.
In the photo above right are: Lou Lodati [standing at left], Ed Lynch [lower at left], as Heimie Nussbaum [center] and Dr. Nussbaum [far right] and two other unnamed Kiwanis members observe.
The third generation of Lodatis carry many of the same family first names as the second. Anthony is the middle son who now runs Lowerys; while Louis Jr, the oldest son retired from the wholesaler / salesman business. Both of Anthony's brothers, Louis and Robert, and his sister-in-law Tina [Robert's wife], still work at the store. It seems their participation in the family business is more out of a love for the business than for anything else.
During a time when so many locally-owned businesses change hands or disappear, it's nice to see others - like Lowerys - carry on the family traditions of serving the community. Small businesses must strike the balance between staying true to the values of old, while adapting to and staying abreast of the new. To this day, Lou Lodati's children own and manage Lowerys Wine & Liquors with a daily family presence in the store and community.
Lou Lodati's father, Dominick, had left behind seven brothers in the small town of Cava de' Tirreni in Italy. All of these brothers had visited America, but all except Dominick, had decided to return home to Italy. Hence there was a strong family connection to the Italian homeland, which the younger Lodatis didn't forget. In the photo to your left is the new dog run adjacent to the Lou Lodati Playground at Torsney Park in Sunnyside.
Lou Lodati sent back money from America to help his relatives and the larger community in which they lived, by helping fund a youth organization. For his contributions to those in Italy, in the mid 1960's [we believe 1966] he received the Gold Star of Italy.
One of Lou Lodati's passions was baseball. For 25 years he headed up the Kiwanis baseball program. The Lou Lodati Playground was commemorated in his honor with some recognition to his passion, as in the corner of the park on 43rd Street and Skillman Avenue is home plate [see photo at left].
Lou Lodati died in 1999. In 2001 the Lou Lodati Playground at 43rd Street and Skillman Avenue was designated in his honor by Mayor Rudolph Guiliani in tandem with City Council Member McCaffrey, who recently died in July of 2013.
Lou Lodati's surviving sisters, Maria and Philomena, along with his three sons - Louis, Anthony and Robert [note many of the first names are the same as those of the prior generation which can be confusing] - were in attendance at the Mayor's signing at City Hall and the commemoration at the park. In the photo to your right are [from left to right]: Robert [son], Philomena Simone [sister], McCaffrey [City Council Member], Anthony [son], Maria Garbarino [sister] and Louis Jr [son].
Lou Lodati's legacy lives on. It lives on in the park, and it lives on in Lowerys Wine & Liquors continued community involvement. Lowerys Wine & Liquor store has been a family run business serving the community for 76 years and I hear tell that Anthony's son, John, has shown an interest in keeping the business in the family for years to come.
Hence the story of the Lou Lodati and the Playground named after him, is a story about how people came to America in search of a better life and found it by taking risks, working hard and serving their community. It's also a story of American generosity, as having achieved some measure of success for themselves, they shared it by helping others.

The Tokeneke Classic is a bicycle race organized by and for racers. It is a challenging multi-loop road race around the Berkhamsted reservoir in central Connecticut, chosen for the terrain and spectacular beauty of the race course. We think it is one of the best courses in the Northeast, and the race serves as the New England Regional Road Race Championship.
Aaron has always felt a passion for, if not a gravitational pull from, racing. Since being lured from the basketball court onto the track in 1993 he set 7 track & field records and medaled six times at the state level of competition.
He moved to the mountain bike in the late 1990s and won the Penn Cycle Buck Hill race series in 2000 in the sport class. He also placed 4th in the Subaru Cup XC race that year.
After moving to New York Aaron took up road racing and rode unattached for the first year and medaled in 2 races including a 1st place finish in the Kissena Race Series in 2007. In 2008 the Brooklyn Arches Cycling Club was formed and the results were immediate and consistent including winning the Cadence Cup Race Series in Brooklyn. He currently races with the Major Taylor Iron Riders Development Team

Health expenditures in Morocco can still represent a heavy burden for households with records showing that until a few years ago, less than half of all costs were being met by the state or health insurance. Access to health care in Morocco was limited by the poor coverage of social protection mechanisms. Less than ten years ago just 32% of the population was insured either through compulsory health insurance or private insurance, now thanks to reforms in the care system and to RAMED, the new Medical Assistance Regime, officials say that number has increased to 53%. Reforming health care and protection is at the heart of the Kingdom’s social welfare policy with emphasis on social inclusion. And supported by the African Development Bank’s Human and Social Development Department these reforms are being to show good results especially amongst the underprivileged and most vulnerable members of society.
Access to clean water in Africa has experienced a significant and positive development in the last decade, in line with the achievements of the Millennium Goals. South of the Sahara, only half of the population had access in 1990, 20 years later that has risen to two-thirds. Thanks to the work of the African Development Bank, Africa’s main partner in the water sector.
Access to clean water in Africa has experienced a significant and positive development in the last decade, in line with the achievements of the Millennium Goals. South of the Sahara, only half of the population had access in 1990, 20 years later that has risen to two-thirds. Thanks to the work of the African Development Bank, Africa’s main partner in the water sector. In Rwanda, for example, AfDB projects over the past five years has provided nearly 600,000 people with drinking water close to their homes. The primary beneficiaries are women, especially young girls. In the region of Louga, 200 kilometres north of Dakar, the Millenium drinking water and sanitation program, or PEPAM, has meant several villages are now connected to the water mains, allowing women’s groups to improve the quality of their market produce. The project has helped about 800,000 people in rural areas, almost 6% of the Senegalese population and some of the infrastructure has been in place for several years. Their management has been delegated to user associations. 500 have been created across the country; they’re responsible for the distribution of water, the collection of water bills and basic maintenance. A priority of every development program is to help the most remote areas. And this applies even to countries that have a solid infrastructure already in place. With 90% of its population having access to water, Tunisia is a pioneer on the continent. However, inequalities do exist; entire territories are without water, which has a serious effect on livestock ranchers and farmers, who often want to seek a living elsewhere. Yet these provinces have what it takes for economic development. The supply of drinking water covers more than 80% of Tunisia. The African Development Bank is funding a $140 million program, which got underway in 2012. Preserving the environment and natural resources is essential in every country in the world, but even more important in countries, like here in Morocco, which is in a situation of water stress. At the city of Khenifra in the Middle Atlas region much of the sewage went straight into the river, making it totally unsuitable for human consumption and destroying much of the aquatic life. The construction of a treatment and sewerage plant means the water from the river can be filtered to make it drinkable. The new plant supplies nearly 250,000 people with clean water. A few miles away, in Khourigba, a municipal team is carrying out maintenance on the city’s new sanitation network. Just two years ago, houses, cellars and sewers were flooded and overflowed into the streets with every heavy rain. Considerable progress has been made across the continent: the AfDB has now helped tens of millions of Africans benefit from access to water, improving health, quality of life, education and entrepreneurship. But the challenges are immense: the annual deficit in water and sanitation infrastructure is estimated at more than $14 billion. With the African population expected to double by 2040, only determined action and renewed support from donors will win the 'Battle of Water' for the poorest on the continent.
For a better life: AfDB Human Development Projects transforming the lives of people in Morocco, Rwanda and Tunisia
Africa’s future is in the hands of its youth! Youths account for more than 60% of a population with a billion inhabitants; a population that will more than double in 2050. Africa will have the most abundant human resources in 2040, surpassing China and India. Human capital is at the heart of AfDB reflections and actions to make the most of Africa’s immense wealth. This movie relates the story of men and women whose lives have been transformed through human development projects financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB) in the areas of health, education and social inclusion. Skills and technology development will drive our action to transform Africa. Our main areas of focus are agriculture and food security, infrastructure, governance, regional integration, gender or fragile states. Our main area of focus is skills development and innovation through better technology adaptation. We will not spare any efforts to solve the difficult and painful problem of unemployment and underemployment among youth and women. To attain this objective, we will address the skills mismatch in the labour market and low productivity in the informal sector, a major provider of jobs for youths and women. We are also strongly encouraging social entrepreneurship and an economic policy that promotes job creation. We have created a new educational model that underscores new opportunities offered by the private sector and ICTs. The provision of distance learning and training thanks to ICTs will enable African youths to acquire skills that meet the labour market’s future needs. Furthermore, we are strengthening our efforts to accelerate the transformation of technical and professional education to foster innovative entrepreneurship and productivity. This will enable the continent to better position itself in the value chains, especially in the agricultural sector. The African Development Bank is currently focusing its efforts on the development of critical skills in various economic sectors, especially infrastructure and natural resource management for improved competitiveness. It will develop science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills. Furthermore, it will create regional knowledge and excellence networks to generate cross-border development and knowledge-sharing opportunities. If our focus has been mainly on skills and technology, the 2011 Arab Spring and the recent crisis in Burkina Faso have brought to light the urgent need to create jobs for youths, improve social inclusion and establish safety nets. The continent’s population explosion coupled with the rise of an incredibly well educated and connected youth, will result in very high demand for social services. The population will increasingly ask for accountability and more fairness. That is why we have included among the pillars of our strategy two important dimensions. The first is accountability through the strengthening of the participation of the voiceless, especially youths, women and marginalized groups in the delivery of services. The second is the creation of inclusive systems to ensure the development and social advancement of the poor and vulnerable groups and their release from the poverty trap. Generally, 40 to 60% of public expenditure is devoted to social sectors (education, health, social protection programmes). However, if AfDB governance programmes focus primarily on public finance management, we will henceforth dedicate ourselves more to governance aspects in education and health programmes. This movie will help you discover some of our financial inclusion programmes, ranging from support for young entrepreneurs through start-up capital to the creation of the first IVY-league University.

Studies in Ancient Art and Civilization were created in 1991 as an irregular series which in the first place served as a forum for the presentation of the Jagiellonian University Institute of Archaeology and studies provided by its researchers. The series was originated by professor Joachim Śliwa, who was also its first Editor in Chief, and since 2010 this function has been fulfilled by professor Ewdoksia Papuci-Władyka. Since vol. 10 (2007) SAAC has become a regular yearly periodical.
Until present fifteen volumes have been published, among them two monographic studies (vols. 3 and 11, the latter being Pontika 2006 conference proceedings edited by E. Papuci-Władyka) and three volumes dedicated to distinguished researchers from our Institute on occasion of their jubilees (vols. 8 – professor Maria Ludwika Bernhard, 14 – professor Joachim Śliwa and 15 – professor Janusz A. Ostrowski).
SAAC publishes papers in the fields of archaeology, art and civilization of ancient Egypt, the Near East, Greece and its colonies, Cyprus and Rome, as well as other, non-Mediterranean ancient civilizations, and also in history of archaeology, collecting of antiquities and reception of ancient culture in modern Europe. Special attention is being given to topics concerning predynastic and early-dynastic Egypt, the Greek and Roman periods in the Black Sea region, and archaeology of Cyprus, due to the excavations conducted by researchers from our Institute in these areas. Objects and artefacts from these excavations are being published in SAAC.
Since 2011 (vol. 15) the publisher has been Księgarnia Akademicka Ltd. in Krakow. Starting with volume 16 (2012) external review procedure will be introduced, compliant to the double-blind review process (anonymity of both reviewed author and reviewer).

Elvis in September — The first month of autumn was a varied one in the life and career of Elvis Presley. In the mid-1950s, he was usually on the road during September. His first controversial appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show came during the month. One of the most important events in his personal life, his first meeting with Priscilla, also happened in September. In the 1960s, September often found him on a Hollywood set, shooting a film to be released the following summer. During the 1970s, Elvis usually finished his summer Las Vegas engagement in early September, and took the rest of the month off to vacation or relax at home in Memphis.
• Elvis in September: A list of important events that occurred in September during the life and career of Elvis Presley
September 9, 1956 — Elvis appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show for the first time. He sang “Don’t Be Cruel,” “Hound Dog,” “Love Me Tender,” and “Ready Teddy.”
September 26, 1956 — Elvis appeared at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show in Tupelo. Elvis had first sung there at age 10.
September 27, 1957 — Elvis made a return appearance at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show in Tupelo.
September 5, 1962 — Location filming began in Seattle for Elvis’s 12th movie, It Happened At the World's Fair.
September 9, 1970 — Elvis appeared in concert at the Phoenix Coliseum. It was his first road show concert since 1961.
In his 23-year recording career, Elvis Presley released a steady stream of single, EP, and LP records. Along the way he accumulated a record number of record sales, gold records, and #1 records. When it came to releasing and selling records, however, September 1956 was a record month for Elvis.
He entered that month as the hottest entertainment personality in the world. He already had three million-selling singles in “Heartbreak Hotel,” “Hound Dog,” and “Don’t Be Cruel.” His personal appearances were drawing record crowds around the country, and he was about to make his first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. But the best indication of his phenomenal success came in the record business that month.
Early in the month RCA released seven more single records available before only on Elvis LPs. They included some of his early Sun Records recordings, like “Tryin’ to Get to You” and “Just Because,” and recent RCA album cuts, such as “Blue Suede Shoes” and “Lawdy, Miss Clawdy.” By September 5 these reissue singles were all selling at the rate of 12,000 a day. By the end of the month, all six singles had gone over 100,000 in sales.
And then, after Elvis sang “Love Me Tender” on the September 9 Sullivan show, dealers all over the country were swamped with orders for the single the next day. Despite already having eight Presley singles on the market, RCA rushed to get Elvis’s new song out. An RCA ad in Billboard on September 29, 1956, proclaimed, “856,327 orders on ‘Love Me Tender’ a week before release.” A footnote added, “by the time you read this, orders will be well over 1,000,000.”
An article in Variety on September 5, 1956, reported that Elvis was due to sell around 10,000,000 records during his first year with RCA Victor. From those sales he earned about $400,000 in royalties, a record payoff for any recording artist at that time. September 1956 was indeed a special month for Elvis Presley.
One September day was like no other in Elvis’s career as a live performer. On September 1, 1957, Elvis was in two countries and three cities. And he performed on stage in two different cities on the same day for one of the few times in his career.
He started the day in Vancouver, B.C., where he had performed the night before. A morning train took him across the border to Seattle, where he arrived at the King Street Station at about noon. After quickly checking into the Olympic Hotel, Elvis was whisked by limousine 35 miles south along Interstate 5 to Tacoma for a 2 p.m. press conference and concert.
By 4:30 p.m. he was back on the road to Seattle. In his room at the Olympic, he had a little time to relax before heading to Sicks’ Seattle Stadium for another press conference and concert starting at 8 p.m. After returning late to his hotel room, Elvis grabbed a few hours sleep before catching an early train the next day for his Labor Day concert in Portland, Oregon. Even at age 22, for Elvis September 1, 1957, must have been an exhausting day.
September 7 — Aaron Schroeder, co-writer of such Elvis songs as "A Big Hunk o' Love," "It's Now or Never," and "Good Luck Charm," was born in 1926.
September 10 — Sherrill Nielsen, a tenor backup singer for Elvis at many concert appearances in the 1970s, was born in 1942.
September 14 — Hal Wallis, producer of many Elvis movies, including G.I. Blues and Blue Hawaii, was born in 1898. He died in 1986.
September 26 — Donna Douglas, Elvis's co-star in Frankie and Johnny, was born in 1933. She died on January 1, 2015, at the age of 81.
September 29 — Lizabeth Scott, Elvis's co-star in Loving You, was born in 1922. She died on January 31, 2015.
“I love football most of all, but I haven’t any time for it. I haven’t any time for anything I like. On the move every minute. Why, I’ve only averaged three hours sleep a night the last week. Can’t go to a football game or a baseball game or a movie or even the county fair in my own home town. It’s the girls … they tear a guy to pieces … It’s pandemonium. They don’t mean no harm, but I’ve been clawed and scratched, mauled, shoved and kicked. I’ve even been bitten. Football was never like this.” — Seattle press conference; September 1, 1957
A compilation of important dates, events, birthdays, and anecdotes from the month of September during the life and career of Elvis Presley
We should have a playdate... With Bo et Obi 😇😍😎😘 .. Some of the videos we made were Bo's biking session with Bapak 😇😍😎
Man, this is the worst I have been since I started WW last Summer! Thank God I'm only a few pounds above my goal so that all this cheating isn't totally making me zoom up a pant size or something. It is however making me feel chubby and soft...and that's SOOOOOOO NOT OK!!
Yet again, I started out smooth sticking to my breaky and lunch....but the afternoon cravings hit and since I've been trying not to keep sweet snacks around I was scrounging (yes, actively freaking scrounging!) through the cupboards trying to find something. At least I didn't stoop low enough to get into the baking supplies! That would be an old habit that I just can't go back to at all. Instead I found one of DBF's power bars...and at least it was only a 3-pointer because it's made with Splenda.
Then I made the mistake of skipping my yogurt/cereal snack before going to my chiropractor appointment. So by the time I was running my errands it was dinner time and I was starving. The NSV is that I did manage to avoid the chocolate bars in the Halloween candy section. I just bought suckers and gumballs and such for the kiddies and then got the Hell outta Dodge. But then my tummy was rumbling for dinner....and there was no way I was gonna make it home for leftovers. OK, I coulda, but I caved. Quizno's was right there. And since I haven't a clue of any of Quizno's NI I just ordered what I wanted. There was sauce and cheese...it's probably not pretty....but it was sure tasty!! But I had it with the brocolli cheese soup....not all that tasty, and certainly not healthy. Oh, and the root beer because the Diet Coke was flat....booooo. I didn't drink all of it though.
Top that off with a mitfull of Skittles in the car (that was supposed to be my big weekend treat, but I sucked most of it back all at once....boooooooooo!)....then some snack nuts and red wine shared with neighbor Jen. Ugh. At least those last few came with good company so I won't complain (much!).
Tomorrow I have a wine tasting with yummy gourmet cheeses and snacks and such. And it's at an awkward time so who knows if I'll get any activity in. I am taking my shoes and Lululemon pants, etc just in case. Doubtful I'm gonna wanna power-walk after a bunch of wines, but might as well be prepared.
Embracing Balance. There is a fine line between happy & healthy and healthy & hating it. You have to walk it carefully.

Come learn about the requirements that will go into effect Jan 1, 2019.
The Environmental Management Department recognizes the food safety efforts of 475 local food businesses. Of the 475 recognized, one establishment from each supervisorial district has been chosen to receive their award on Sept 11 at the Board of Supervisors meeting. The list of Award of Excellence recipients can be found on our Awards of Excellence in Food Safety Page.
Donating surplus food from restaurants and other food facilities can be a sustainable and simple way to help local non-profit and charitable organizations serve those in need in our community. More Information can be found on our Food Donations Page.
It is important to know that our creeks, streams and rivers are an open resource for the public, animals and wildlife. These water sources are considered non-potable (not to be ingested) because of their inherent risk of transitory contamination from potentially harmful organisms such as Blue-Green algae and E. coli (a bacteria in the waste of animals/birds/humans). Under the right conditions, these organisms or the toxins they produce can make people and animals sick if ingested or absorbed through open cuts or wounds.
It is recommended that everyone visiting a recreational waterbody practice these general safe and healthy habits for swimming:
For additional information on healthy habits for swimming or to inquire about current water quality along the Lower American River, please visit Sacramento County Regional Parks.
Individuals who suspect they may have gotten sick after swimming in rivers or streams in Sacramento County should report it to the Sacramento County Division of Public Health at 916-875-5881 so that the source of the illness can be investigated.
Blue-Green Algae are some of the oldest organisms on Earth and can be found in fresh- and salt-water bodies throughout the world. They prefer warm stagnant nutrient rich water and are found most often in ponds, lakes, and slow moving rivers. Some species of Blue-Green Algae produce powerful toxins which can be extremely harmful to humans, pets, and wildlife if ingested. Certain times of the year when conditions are right (warm temperatures, low water flow, etc), the algae can bloom forming thick mats or crusts that rest on top of the water. Other species of Blue-Green Algae can cloud the water giving it a greenish to blue tint or a pea soup look. Learn how to spot a harmful algae bloom and know what to do in case you, your children, or your pet come in contact with one.
EMD will be hosting four public workshops to discuss a proposed change to the County Well Ordinance, two workshops for well owners and two workshops for well contractors. The proposal is to change the term of well inactivation permits from 2 years to 5 years. See the attached flyer for more details and workshop dates.
Are you making changes to your food facility? Make sure your changes meet EMD requirements before you start. If you are adding new equipment, service areas (e.g. bar) or making menu changes, check with EMD first. This video explains what types of changes may require plan review and how to get it approved.
Who wants to get sick? The power to avoid illness is in your hands… with some soap… So, remember to wash your hands frequently with soap for 20 seconds. This is still one of the best ways to prevent the spread of disease. http://www.dhhs.saccounty.net/PUB/Pages/PUB-Home.aspx
SepticSmart Week focuses on educating homeowners and communities on the proper care and maintenance of their septic systems. Each day, new information, tips, and resources will be posted to the EMD Facebook page. Common in rural areas without public sewer service, septic systems are underground wastewater treatment structures that use a combination of nature and time-tested technology to treat wastewater from household plumbing produced by bathrooms, kitchen drains, and laundry. Proper maintenance of septic systems help to save you money, protect your property value, and keeps you and your neighbors healthy. What does EMD do to protect public health and the environment? EMD issues permits and conducts inspections to ensure the proper installation, repair, and modification of septic systems in Sacramento County, including the unincorporated area and all incorporated cities. For more information, download the Homeowner's Guide for Septic Systems or visit EMD’s Septic System Program page.
It is important to know that our creeks, streams and rivers are an open resource to the public, animals and waterfowl. Recreational water is considered non-potable (not to be ingested) and has an inherent risk of transitory contamination from such contaminates as algae and E. coli (bacteria in the waste of animals/birds/humans) that can make you sick. Anyone visiting a body of recreational water should never ingest/drink the water and should always shower after. If people suspect they have gotten sick after swimming in rivers and streams in Sacramento County they should report it to Sacramento County Division of Public Health at 916-875-5881 so that the source of the illness can be investigated.

The Environmental Management Department (EMD) completed its CalOES grant- funded Area Plan Update for Emergency Response to Hazardous Materials Incidents in Sacramento County. Hazardous material emergencies may be the result of threatened releases, highway accidents, clandestine drug laboratories, train derailments, pipeline transportation accidents, fire and/ or spills at fixed facilities or even disasters. The Area Plan, a collaborative effort with a wide range of area stakeholders, describes the responsibilities of local, state and federal agencies during incidents involving the release and/ or threatened release of hazardous materials in Sacramento County.

Sacramento County Environmental Management Department (EMD) received the California State Association of Counties (CSAC) Merit Award for an innovative program to identify and properly close abandoned water wells which are a hazard and a potential source of groundwater contamination. Wells constructed prior to the County’s permitting programs and now abandoned or improperly sealed are difficult to locate. This program uses a database management system with integrated GIS mapping along with public outreach to identify and properly address abandoned wells that pose a threat to groundwater quality and are a falling-in hazard to people and animals. As of June 2015, more than 770 abandoned wells have been identified.
EMD is asking for your help in identifying abandoned wells in Sacramento County. Visit the Abandoned Wells Program page for more information.

Apparently, James Dyson often looked to his design hero, Thomas Edison, for inspiration. He closely followed Edison’s approach to design using iteration to relentlessly change one or two things to test what works and what doesn’t. This has served James Dyson well over the years.
The idea of studying and copying others to help inspire, innovate and solve problems is a technique that has also been studied and copied. One group of photography students named this technique ‘What would Terry do?’ based on the work of an American photographer Terry Richardson who was notorious for bucking trends. This helped them break out of their traditional thought processes and establish new perspectives.
I'm the Chief Operating Officer for Emergn and Product Manager for VFQ®.

The problem with the truth is that you can’t bend it to fit what feels right to you at the moment. The truth just…is.
That’s why sometimes being “real” and speaking the “truth” can get a little tricky. We often associate being real with being unafraid to let your struggles, your flaws, and your insecurities hang out. While that is part of being authentic, it is equally as valuable to acknowledge your victories, your gifts, and your strengths! We should not be afraid to acknowledge that which is true.
Today was a genuinely great day. I love my job. Love, love it. And the craziest part is that it just sort of snuck up on me. I love that I get to stay at home with my girls almost all of the time. I don’t mind the fact that most of my free time is filled with writing “work” things. And on the rare occasion that I get to go into work and exercise my creative muscles – I genuinely come home giddy. Giddy, people.
I am wrestling my way through how to harness my gifts and use them in this right now life and how to be content with where God has me, but I’m beginning to see glimpses of what it all could be. It’s nothing like what I expected, but I’m okay with that. I’m feeling a little more adventurous, a little more “let’s do this thing,” and I cannot help but look to the Initiator of all faith, Giver of every good thing in it all. Because the truth is I am not adventurous. And “doing this thing” usually just makes me want to puke.
Life is good today – and I just wanted to say it out loud. What does good look like in your life right now?

2. The Least of These - We believe everyone we encounter is someone who matters to God, and someone for whom Christ died. It is our privilege and mandate to offer Christ to people through the power of the Holy Spirit, leaving the results to God. We believe everyone needs Jesus. ﻿﻿(Luke 15:10, Matthew 28:18-20, Revelation 5:9, Matthew 25:31-46, Acts 10:34-43
3. Discipleship - Jesus’ parting challenge to the church as he ascended into heaven was for us to go and make disciples. Disciples of Jesus are made, not born. Disciples result from a deliberate process of training and spiritual formation. God’s desire is that every individual in the church personally embrace the Great Commission—that, in one sense, we are all “missionaries” wherever we are located. All believers are to be “on mission,” to do their part in reaching their city, nation, and the world for Jesus Christ while personally embracing this mission. God’s will is that every individual work together with others as a team, serving within their giftedness and unique role as part of that team in fulfilling the Great Commission. (Matthew 28:18-20, Ephesians 4:11-16, 1 Peter 2:9)
4. Forgiveness - Jesus extends a loving invitation for forgiveness of sins which is only possible through His shed blood. He gave His life so that we may live. We are forgiven because He was forsaken. Through our forgiveness we seek reconciliation and for﻿giveness with one another so that we are freed to love one another unconditional﻿ly and be unified as the Body of Christ. (Isaiah 55:6-7, ﻿﻿﻿Matthew 6:14,﻿﻿ Matthew﻿ ﻿18: 21-22, ﻿﻿Colossians 3: 13﻿ ﻿﻿﻿Ephesians 1:7)
﻿5. Inclusiveness - We embrace diversity; understanding that all people are loved by God. We seek to create a non-judgmental, grace filled, environment that seeks and welcomes all people of all ages, races and gender. (Galatians 3:28)﻿
6. Spiritual Formation - We understand that no one is perfect, but with God’s help we can learn new ways of living and being more and more like Christ. We seek to build a foundation for people to grow in Christ-like character. (Ephesians 4:22)
7. Missions and Outreach - We seek to live our faith in action that alleviates human suffering both locally and globally. We are convinced that the church does not exist for itself but also for those beyond the walls of our building. We seek to intentionally share our faith with those not connected to a church so that they may know of God’s great love for them. (Luke 4:18, Philemon 1:6)
8. Worship - We esteem worship as a central act of the church. We seek to be relevant to people of different generations and backgrounds so that all can praise God in ways that best connect them to God. We worship of God in an effort to thank Him for who He is and what He has done (Ps 150, Rom. 15:9,
9. Love - Worldly definitions of love typically include a feeling of strong attraction that overcomes us or we fall into. But Biblical love is much more than this; it is a way of life, a more excellent way. Some consider love a virtue or character trait. But the Bible teaches that love is a spiritual grace produced by God. Jesus also reminds us that the greatest thing we can do is Love God and love our neighbors. Therefore love is at the heart of any church. (Matthew 22:34-40, Matthew 25:31-46, 1 Corinthians 12:31)
10. Families - We believe that strong families are foundational for the physical, social, emotional, and spiritual development of each individual; for healthy relational patterns within the church; and for stability in society. Strong families produce strong churches and strong communities (Ephesians 5:22-6:4)
11. Community - We value the fellowship of believers and strengthening our relationship with God through each other as a community of Christian friends, that God is able to begin the healing process in our lives. And we not only need a place where we can receive this kind of love and support, but also a place where we can give it to others. (Genesis 1:26, Romans 12:5, Acts 2:44-46, Acts 4:34-35, 1Thessalonians 4:9-10)
12. The Grace of God - God’s grace through Jesus Christ is our bedrock and power for our salvation, our life in Christ and our ministry, both individually and as a church (2 Corinthians 9:8)
13. All are Gifted Ministers - We believe that every single follower of Jesus Christ has at least one spiritual gift. And if every follower of Jesus Christ has a spiritual gift, then each of us has an area of ministry for which God has gifted and designed us. What this means is that God wants every follower of Jesus to use their lives to make a difference for eternity. (Ephesians 4:12, 1 Corinthians 12:7)
14. Prayer - Recognizing our church’s desperate need for God to guide, equip, and empower the church to accomplish its ministry aspirations we seek prayer in all things.(John 15:5, Acts 2:42, 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18)
15. Relevance - The church fulfills the purposes of God and therefore should be relevant in its context and community. True relevance is understanding culture and responding to hurts and needs with the gospel, sacrifical love, and selfless ministering. Life is too short to spend it doing something irrelevant. Seeking wealth, fame, and power are not relevant reasons for living. Changing people’s lives and their eternal destinies is! This is the exciting privilege that God has given us. (Matthew 25:31-46, Ephesians 3:10-11, Philemon 4-7)
Roulette is an easy game to understand, and a very enjoyable one to play. Thanks to this fact, there are now a number of different types and variations for online players to enjoy. We take a look at the differences between the two most popular versions, but remember there is also French Roulette with its La Partage and en Prison rules, Double Ball Roulette, Multi wheel Roulette, Mini Roulette and many other fun variants available online.
The prime difference between American Roulette and European Roulette is the design of the wheel. In the former version there is an additional 0 pocket, a 00, and this increases the house advantage thanks to the fact that you will then be required to choose from 1 extra pocket where the ball may land. This game thus offers you odds of 1/38 to win and is also often called Double Zero Roulette.
Thanks to the fact that Roulette has its origins in France, the European variation is probably the most authentic. The numbers on this game’s wheel range from 0 up to 36 only, so this affords you a slightly better chance of winning. The odds for this game are lower, at 1/37. Thanks to this increase in the odds of winning, the stakes are quite significantly decreased as well. The house edge for this variation is 2.7%, as opposed to the American variation with a 5.27% edge, and this results in any losses you may see being much smaller when you enjoy playing at one of the online roulette NZ casinos available to you.
When playing European Roulette, traditionally players have had the options to pay a small amount of money to the croupier in order to start the ball spinning from a certain spot on the wheel. There are also other culturally-ingrained formalities that you should be aware of that pertain to online play too, like the La Partage rule. This states that after a 0 spin, the player is able to leave his or her wager on the same spot on which it had originally been placed it before the 0 spin, in order to recover that loss.
The casinos catering for American clientele usually make that variation available to their players. Should you be having any trouble finding the European variation when you are in the mood to play, seek out those named Single Zero Roulette. These will provide the version of the game you are looking for.
Since some time ago online casinos have introduced a concept that has been very successful for the casinos. This concept is to offer the possibility for players to play flash games for free. When a person visits the casino usually offers you the option to play for money or play for fun. This has been very convenient because players can play without the pressure of being such bet money and those without much experience can play for free until they feel confident in their flash game.
特別在黃昏時分，長廊就顯出一片絕類似于荒蕪的神色來，空曠的長廊兩邊對稱著幾道門，卻古怪地沒有門板，看上去整個長廊就像被鏤空的長方體，別扭又透出陰森。夕陽的光施舍不進來，只是其他建筑的一點余光吝嗇地偷溜過來，于是暗暗的陰藍就包裹住了長廊，成了底色。墻上生著積蓄多年的青苔，還有灰色的墻體剝落的痕跡……在空氣中飄著的是潮濕陰涼的霉味……

I would have to get Amrum from Portmouth round to somewhere close to Cardiff. Not quite the Atlantic, but a very big step for me!
I expect I would take over a couple of weeks to get round, popping into safe havens when needed etc.
Has anybody sailed around the south western tip of england? I could after all, end up somewhere in herefordshire and Cardiff area looks like the most likely place to find a mooring I can get to. Any local knowledge would be great. Isle of man is off, which is a shame. I would have to get Amrum from Portmouth round to somewhere close to Cardiff. Not quite the Atlantic, but a very big step for me! I expect I would take over a couple of weeks to get round, popping into safe havens when needed etc.
Amrum is coming home to the Bristol Channel! I believe that it was originally a Portishead boat owned by a guy who called all his boats Amrum. I now have Amrum 3 (now called Super Snoopy). Amrum was short for hammerthem, such was the feeling in the Bristol Channel between the racing boats on the English coast and their counterparts on the other side.
Things are easy once you get to Ilfracombe, the tide takes you up to Cardiff in about six hours. Nikki can tell you all the bits from Ilfracome to Lands End.
Re your choice of final resting place, look at www.bristolchannel.co.uk It gives details of all clubs and marinas in the upper reaches of our area. Newport Uskmouth Sailing Club will be the nearest (and by far the cheapest) club to Herefordshire. However if Amrum is a fin, you're out of luck, we are now closed for new fin members due to lack of space in our deep mud moorings. There is plenty of room for triple keelers.
Good luck and if you want any more info, get in touch. One thing - don't have white antifouling - it gets a lovely shade of khaki in our waters.

Sailing around the UK and Ireland by Roger Oliver is a useful guide and I am happy to send you a scan of the relevant pages. Best not to post it on Flickr due to copyright but send me your e-mail address on Flickr mail and I will e-mail jpgs gladly.
As Amrum is a fin, Cardiff looks like the best bet, but you might try Lydney YC. They are doing up the harbour behind the lock, and I understand there are 3 A24 fin keels there at present, although I still haven't been up to see. If of interest, let me know, and I'll get you some contact names.
Let me know when you're planning to go, and if you need a crew for all or some of the trip. I can't promise, as a full summer booked already, but if you wanted help I'd try and fit in for part of it.
Incidentally, the original owner of Amrum still sails an A24 (and an A740) at Thornbury, and as Snoopy says, 'Amrum' was his battle cry, originally when he played rugby! He owned Snifter, his A740 is also Amrum, and he's owned literally dozens of Achilles over the years! He'd be delighted if yur Amrum made it back to the Bristol Channel.

Thanks Snifter, we are making a trip up to Hereford for the interview and staying over for the weekend , so will probably go and have a look if we can find the time, but I expect time will be a bit tight as we will probably look at some places we might like to live.

We will have three months to plan and get things organised if She gets it. Help might well be needed on the last legs as local knowledge would be plended thing indeed. Need to get some work done pretty soon and get some sailing in.
I ve sailed from Falmouth all my life, Ive done Padstow to Falmouth, Falmouth to Dartmouth and all in between! Salcome and Padstow have bars , Do not attempt Hayle, Lizard and lands end go with the tide,But can be rough any time,, Ive gone around six or seven times

Helford lovely, Fowey cramped The Yealm better than plymouth but hidden entrance. The nice thing is they are all day trips,
But it is looking ever more likely every day. I have lived a good 57 years now and it's the way I would want to go, sailing into the sunset doing what I love to do.
That's great, thanks for that just the sort of advice I need. I would like to break it into day hops as I will probably be on my own, but we will see. But it is looking ever more likely every day. I have lived a good 57 years now and it's the way I would want to go, sailing into the sunset doing what I love to do.
All the south coast bits are just a question of where you would like to stop. for convenient jumps you can do something like Portsmouth to Weymouth, Weymouth to dartmouth/Salcombe/Brixham, with brixham being the easiest to enter at any state of tide. From there it's any choice you like, Fowey, Mevagissy, looe. Round the Lizard with the tide in your favour, it's very strong if it's against you and go to Newlyn which is good any state of tide. Work backwards from Longships and time your departure from Newlyn to put you off longships at exactly low water. This tide will carry to Padstow with you arriving at high water. If you get it right you will have 9 hours favourable tide. Leave Padstow as soon as there is water, roughly 2 hours before HW and head for Hartland. You should get past it on the full flood and you'll be going like a train. it's wonderful. Don't go anywhere near Hartland. Stay at least a couple of miles off. It's a really bad spot for a boat and can have large, 4' plus standing waves even on a calm day. A good guide is to aim slightly west of halfway between hartland light and Lundy south. err on the side of Lundy. You'll then be charging up towards Bull Point, if it's dark there's a sector light. Turn to starboard and you're in Ilfracombe. Next day Cardiff. leave Ilfracombe about LW and you'll make cardiff for HW. it's a lovely trip with the hightlight being the run up the exposed North Cornwall/devon coats. It's wild and you'll see very little shipping. An alternative, which is what I do and prefer, is to do Newlyn to Ilfracombe in one hit. It's a beautiful sail and the tides work such that you generally arrive off Hartland at the young flood so you could possibly even make Cardiff on that tide.

Dont try P Z or Newlyn at night ,, tooo many low down shore lights. There are two or three mooring bouys off Penzance, Good site aint it?
Very good site, Chille. I should have a pretty good plan by the time I leave the safety of the Solent. Like most problems, if you break them down into smaller parts, it's not so bad.
All advice is greatfully received, hope we get a good season as we could all do with a bit of fun after this pig of a year.
Very good site, Chille. I should have a pretty good plan by the time I leave the safety of the Solent. Like most problems, if you break them down into smaller parts, it's not so bad. I will allow plenty of time and not take silly risks trying to be do it fast. Thanks Guillainevib, your a star. All advice is greatfully received, hope we get a good season as we could all do with a bit of fun after this pig of a year. Peter
You're welcome. Glad to be of use. Ron is right about the lights, but it's not insurmountable and anyway, you should only be doing a day trip from Falmouth so it will be daylight. Forgot to mention Falmouth, or the Helford is a nice stop. Can still anchor for nothing downstream from the swinging moorings? Ron, still free anchorage? Not been there for a few years. Seriously though Peter, don't underestimate the strength of the Lizard tides. I got it wrong once and it took me seventeen hours, yes seventeen, to get from the Helford to Newlyn. Not my proudest moment, especially as the batteries were flat when I got there and so engine wouldn't start. Had to paddle in at 0200. crap. Mention my name to Royden or Dave when you get to newlyn and they will probably tell you to f*** off. :) Send them my best.

Well after all that, we are not going. so on to the next. Scotland has come up, now that's a challange!
Sure it's a bigger challenge, but if west coast, the same applies as far as west Wales. :) Then follow the tides onwards. `where is the next interview?
Elgin, which is very close to Lossimouth. we are flying up to Inverness on thursday from Gatwick. We have hired a car and will drive to Elgin.
Can you Sail up the Canal? I don't know Scotland very well, have only been to Glasgow and Edinburgh on a plane.
Elgin, which is very close to Lossimouth. we are flying up to Inverness on thursday from Gatwick. We have hired a car and will drive to Elgin. T will go and have a look at the job and I will go and have a look at the marina at Lossimouth. Would probably sail up the east coast as it would be shorter, probably not as nice! Can you Sail up the Canal? I don't know Scotland very well, have only been to Glasgow and Edinburgh on a plane. Interview will be in six weeks.
Lovely part of the world and nice people. The Glasgow to Edinburgh canal is open for crossing the middle as is the Caledonian Canal to go from Fort William to Inverness. Caledonian is fantastic as still the original from 1822 designed by Thomas Telford. The lock gates are still original and the mechanisms still work, fantastic. I am told that the Glasgow to Edinburgh is a bit shallow but the Achilles doesn't draw much.
Marinas are few and far between up there but cheap. Inverness has a nice new one but tides are strong and need watching. Findhorn bay is one of the best anchorages/mooring in the world (honest it is that good) Buckie has a commercial harbour and plenty of strange people and I believe that there are harbours at Nairn and a nice one at Lossiemouth. I had a mooring at Fortrose and whilst nice and very cheap, still have the ground anchor tackle for it, a bit exposed. Cromarty/Invergordon a nice place.
As for sailing up the East coast watch Onkudu on youtube as that guy sailed a corribee up that coast and a good watch, different from Dillon Winters but it will take Dillon 3 more years to sail all that way!
Lovely part of the world and nice people. The Glasgow to Edinburgh canal is open for crossing the middle as is the Caledonian Canal to go from Fort William to Inverness. Caledonian is fantastic as still the original from 1822 designed by Thomas Telford. The lock gates are still original and the mechanisms still work, fantastic. I am told that the Glasgow to Edinburgh is a bit shallow but the Achilles doesn't draw much. Marinas are few and far between up there but cheap.

Thank's Chaps I hope we get settled some place soon, I just want to get on with it. Still my boat is back at Cowes, so it's not that bad is it. Dillon! is he the one with the Mirror doing the round Briton going up every little nook and cranny?
If you go up there I would absolutely recommend you go up the west coast and use a canal to go east. I know I'm west biased, but there's just more stuff to see up the west coast. Isle of Man, Ireland, Western Isles etc. The canals are amazing. My two pence worth, no more than that. :)

Can anyone advise the height of the uppermost point of the pulpit on a triple keel to the ground (nett height not including any blocks or trailer that the keel might be raised on)? A fin keel height would be fine to as I would subtract 6 inches. The shipping line need to know whether the yacht height will be above the container top load line for stacking.

Edit: another query, does the stated 1,180kg displacement include the rig? Many thanks Richard
Hi Richard, regarding the pulpit to ground dimension, my newly acquired fin keeler is out of the water and I can measure tomorrow for you. Hopefully a bilge keeler will post for you, but failing that I'll go ahead.

James Blunt 4 évvel ezelőtti, óriási sikerű koncertje után visszatér Budapestre új, The Afterlove elnevezésű turnéjával. Kevés olyan előadó van, aki ennyire gyorsan lett világsztár és mégis megmaradt szerény, póz nélküli embernek, mint James Blunt. A felső-középosztálybeli családból származó énekes – eredeti nevén James Hillier Blount – 1974-ben született az angliai Tidworth-ben és 14 évesen vásárolta első gitárját, amellyel dalokat kezdett írni. Legújabb albuma The Afterlove címmel tavasszal jelent meg, az elmúlt hónapokban pedig Robin Schulz szerzeményével, az OK című dallal hallható folyamatosan a rádiókban.
I tend to accumulate a lot of books – sent to me by publishers and publicists – and they pile up on my desk until I have to make a trip somewhere. Because it takes a long time to get from Hawaii to anywhere else, I always grab a book or two from my stack to keep myself occupied while in a plane or while waiting for one.
For my most recent trip, I grabbed Amanda Little’s book Power Trip: The Story of America’s Love Affair with Energy . Little describes herself as an environmentalist who — up until writing this book — had “one major blind spot” in her understanding of energy:
“I also realized that this thing that I’d thought was a four-letter word (oil) was actually the source of many creature comforts I use and love – and many survival tools I need. It seemed almost miraculous. Never before had I grasped the immense versatility of fossil fuels on a personal level and their greater relevance in the economy at large.”
I was surprised that I had not come across her work before; she writes about topics that I am intensely interested in and has written for some sites that I read like Grist and Salon. But as far I know, this was the first time I had encountered any of her writing.
Little describes her energy epiphany near the beginning of the book. Her “aha moment” came during the 2003 blackout in the Northeastern part of the United States; the largest blackout in recorded history. Suddenly Little saw a city without electricity for an extended period of time, and the paralysis she witnessed in New York City in the wake of the blackout drove home a very important message: We are incredibly dependent on the fossil fuels so many people love to hate, and life would not be a bed of roses without them. I described Little’s energy epiphany in my previous essay Democrats and Energy Policy. (She also covers these themes in this Youtube video).
I understand the epiphany that Little underwent, because I had the same one many years ago. After my own epiphany, I didn’t consider myself any less of an environmentalist, but I more fully understood the broader implications of our use of fossil fuels. While there are undoubtedly downsides – in many cases potentially very serious downsides – I could not deny that fossil fuels have greatly improved the living conditions for many people.
I began to see that while campaigns to limit the usage of fossil fuels in our lives may seem like the environmentally responsible thing to do, there is no free lunch. What I seek to do now is make sure people understand the implications of what they are asking for. If we limit our ability to produce energy, there are three choices: 1). We simply have to cut back on our energy consumption; 2). We import more oil, pushing some of the environmental consequences from our shores to the shores of countries like Nigeria; 3. We replace our fossil fuel consumption with alternative energy. The problem with many environmentalists resides with the third option. We could only achieve that through sacrifices and difficult trade-offs that are generally unrecognized.
But I digress from Little’s story. Little went on a journey that reminded of that of Lisa Margonelli in Oil on the Brain . Their journeys were to different locations, but each journey forever changed the way the authors looked at energy, and particularly fossil fuels. Like me, they began to fully appreciate that fossil fuels make the modern world possible. While researching this book, Little spent two years traveling around the country to better understand America’s energy situation. She traveled to deep-sea oil rigs, Kansas cornfields, the Talladega Superspeedway, a plastic surgeon’s office, the Pentagon offices, a Texas wind farm, and underneath New York City for a look at their “third-world grid.”
Little began her story by taking us on a history of oil production in the United States. I confess that I don’t know all that much about John D. Rockefeller, but discussion of his role in the development of the oil industry fascinated me enough that I want to read his biography. But one thing that struck me is that so many people still believe this is the way the oil industry operates; that a small group colludes to fix prices and rip off the American people. That’s just not the way the world works anymore; at least not in the U.S. Because U.S. oil companies are so small relative to the national oil companies, the impact that U.S. oil companies can have on oil prices is small and fleeting. (OPEC and Russia, on the other hand, are a different story).
Little takes readers into a war zone in Iraq, where you quickly appreciate that the drivers of fuel convoys have some of the most dangerous jobs in the world. The journey again becomes historical, covering Churchill’s decision to switch the British fleet from coal to oil, the role oil played in the military actions of Germany and Japan in World War II, and the history of the relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.
Using colorful and descriptive language that sometimes made me feel like I was reading Anne Rice, Little takes us to a NASCAR race, where she developed a sudden appreciation for why these races are so popular (why people watch car races or golf on TV still eludes me). She emphasizes the importance of oil in the production of plastics, something we often take for granted when we talk about our dependence for oil. She went through the history of Tupperware, which was interesting but wandered pretty far off-topic in my opinion.
She took us on a tour of the importance of fossil fuels in the global food supply chain. From the nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides that enable record yields (her Kansas farmer said without fertilizer he might get 1/3rd of his present yield) to the trucks, trains, and ships that bring food from all over the world onto our plates — she found that fossil fuels enabled every step of the process. (However, she also pointed out that a 3G phone has even more oil embedded in it than bananas from Central America that are shipped to U.S. supermarkets; the 3G supply chain consumes 1.7 gallons of oil per phone!)
Inside the Pentagon, she learned that a $10 increase in the price of crude oil increases operating costs at the Department of Defense (DoD) by $1.4 billion dollars a year. She also learned that the world’s largest photovoltaic farm is on an air force base, and that the DoD — often criticized for their heavy use of petroleum — is also one of the world’s largest consumers of green power. She was told that 12% of DoD electricity derives from renewable sources.
In an L.A. plastic surgeon’s office, she learned of the importance of petroleum in making silicone breast implants, but also in producing syringes, blood bags, surgical gloves and numerous other items in the medical industry. As an aside, she pointed out that in 2006 the FDA had quietly dropped the moratorium on silicone breast implants, having found no link between these implants and autoimmune disorders. I still recall in the early 90′s when lawyers were taking out ads in newspapers everywhere, inviting women to sue over a perceived link between the implants and autoimmune disorders. While good science ultimately won out, some lawyers are pretty crafty at making a living around bad science. Hot gas, anyone?
After going into some detail about the environmental downside of fossil fuels, Little provided a glimpse into the future in Part 2 of the book: Greener Pastures. And this is where I would fault the book. I think Little under-appreciates the challenges and implications of ultimately moving to a fossil fuel-free world. For instance, her first chapter in this section is subtitled “How Renewable Energy Will Dethrone the Powers That Be.” She takes us to Pampa, Texas (where I have been many times) — the site of T. Boone Pickens’ massive wind farm project. She wrote all about his grand vision. Readers are left with the impression of Pickens’ wind farm helping to “dethrone the powers that be.”
The postscript, however, is that the grand vision was much more challenging for Pickens to execute. Quoting one of the long-time skeptics of Pickens’ plan, Robert Bryce:
After 30 months, countless TV appearances, and $80 million spent on an extravagant PR campaign, T. Boone Pickens has finally admitted the obvious: The wind energy business isn’t a very good one.
The Dallas-based entrepreneur, who has relentlessly promoted his “Pickens Plan” since July 4, 2008, announced earlier this month that he’s abandoning the wind business to focus on natural gas.
Knowing how things turned out for Pickens, you might be just a wee bit more skeptical of her vision of how the future is going to play out. And I think many of the stories that Little covered — this greening of power in America — are likely to turn out the same way. Where she sees renewable energy technologies improving until they dethrone fossil fuels, I see fossil fuels becoming so expensive that renewables gradually become competitive. That’s a much different vision than the one she lays out in the book. (However, I should point out that she does support offshore drilling; undoubtedly a result of her energy epiphany giving her a better understanding of our energy predicament).
Little did cover a number of interesting developments in Part 2; some of which may ultimately make a big impact. One of the most interesting to me was her coverage of developments in green building. She discussed Brad Pitt’s Make It Right foundation, which is building 150 green homes in New Orleans’ Ninth Ward that was so devastated by Hurricane Katrina. She told the story of a new home owner whose energy bills had dropped from $500 a month to under $100 a month in her new home.
But Little also covered green building developments for commercial buildings. She said that globally, buildings account for 40% of all energy usage, and in the U.S. they consume 30% of all raw materials and produce 30% of our landfill waste. She covered the technologies and developments that are designed to drastically reduce those numbers with a visit to the Bank of America Tower in Manhattan — which received a platinum rating from the U.S. Green Building Council (but cost $1 billion to build).
As I read this book, I began to think of it as a layman’s guide to understanding the real role that energy plays in our lives. This book should be required reading for anyone who still believes that oil is a four letter word. It won’t necessarily change your mind about oil’s downsides, but you will certainly come away with a greater appreciation for the role it plays in your life. And even if you are well-informed on energy issues, there is still material in the book of interest.
I gauge a book by whether I learned something new and interesting, and whether I believe the book’s factual claims are generally correct. Power Trip passes on those counts. It is a book that I can easily recommend, especially for someone who is starting from a lower level of energy proficiency.
If only we could get people to understand who the modern John D. Rockefeller is on Wall Street. Let history give us another lesson.
Some conservatives will call it a coincidence this all happened in the Bush administration, while the liberals will call it a conspiracy. They shouted with joy for the changes to come with the Obama administration…and yet little has changed as to who owns the Rockefeller and Morgan legacy.
I eagerly await the day when Robert has an “energy epiphany” of his own, and suddenly realizes that electrical energy is far more important to the actual world we live in than oil ever thought about being
…suddenly realizes that electrical energy is far more important to the actual world we live in than oil ever thought about being.
No question, electricity is vital to our quality of life, but transportation would be dead in the water (literally) without liquid fuels.
Look around your house. If you’ve got something, chances are very high it got there, or to the place where you bought it, on a truck burning diesel fuel.
Air travel? Good luck flying across the ocean, across the country, or even to the next city without airplanes burning liquid fuels. I’ll go out on limb here and say you will never see a battery-powered airliner that can fly from New York to Amsterdam.
Barge traffic on our rivers and waterways carries bulk commodities such as grain, coal, cement, timber, etc. It will be a long time until we see an electric tow boat pushing 24 barges up or down the Mississippi.
Cargo ships crossing the oceans? Don’t ever expect to see a battery-powered container ship going from Wilmington, NC to Rotterdam.
Do you think you could live with-out the “Grapes Imported from Chile’ sticker on the produce you buy ?
Of course I could — and mostly do. But that doesn’t mean we don’t need ships carrying stuff across the oceans (For example, Midwest grain loaded in Duluth, MN going through the Saint Lawrence Seaway to countries with hungry people), and diesel-powered tow boats pushing barges full of grain, sand, cement, and other heavy commodities up and done the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers.
It also doesn’t mean there is no reason for airliners to carry people across country or across oceans. (Are you ready to go back to five days by ocean liner between New York and Rotterdam? Or three days by train between New York and LA?)
Ocean liners and cargo ships burn bunker oil — we aren’t going to see them electrified, and going back to using sails is possible, but not likely on a large scale. We could — and should — see wider use of electric trains as they do in Europe, but it would take a massive infrastructure investment to electrify all our railroads.
Or you have your own and realize that if electricity disappeared tomorrow, life as we know it would change dramatically and millions would die. If oil disappeared tomorrow, billions would die.
I just think it’s hilarious that you even continue to maintain this, given your acknowledgement that 2 billion people already live without electricity. Without oil, the carrying capacity of the world might not even be 2 billion people (but I suspect we could manage that). If you look at the history of electricity consumption, it was still quite low at the end of WW2. Yet the global population had already reached almost 3 billion, and oil had enabled the allies to win the war.
The bottom line is that I recognize the importance of both. But you are operating under the delusions that oil can be easily replaced. It is you that requires an energy epiphany to realize just how dependent your life is on oil. Maybe you should pick up Power Trip.
I am fast coming to the conclusion that you don’t have the faintest idea what you are talking about. There are some plastics that can be made from biomass. That doesn’t begin to cover a fraction of the types of plastics we use (nor the scale at which we use them). So you are quite confused about the difference between the ability to produce some very specific types of plastic from biomass, and replacing the category of plastics with biomass.
That’s like saying that jet and marine transport can continue to run without oil, because we can make ethanol from cellulose. Number 1, we can’t make it economically, and Number 2, there are very good reasons that marine transport doesn’t run on ethanol.
Since those are analogs for electric motors — not fertilizer, pesticides, or combustion engines — then we know (according to your logic about bioplastics) that we can continue just fine without electricity. We just need more water-wheels. After all, a water-wheel can perform the work of an electric motor, therefore it can replace all electric motors. Right, plastic man?
