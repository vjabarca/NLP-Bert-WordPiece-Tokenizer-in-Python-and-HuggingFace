Why is that so? Maybe because of three hundred years of British colonization, many of India’s politicians, bureaucrats and journalists are often copying whatever the West does, or are eternally worrying about what the West thinks of them. They rarely think Indian, know all about Shakespeare, but very little of Kalidasa, one of the greatest poets ever on this Planet; have read about Abraham Lincoln, but know nothing of Sri Aurobindo, philosopher, poet, revolutionary, immense yogi. Many of India’s intelligentsia have thus no idea about India’s great culture, philosophy and spirituality. Very few have read the Bhagavad Gita, or understood that it encourages yoga in action and that sometimes it is important to defend one’s country, culture and borders, by force if necessary, as Shivaji Maharaj practiced it.
There is also the wrong notion that Shivaji was anti-Muslim because he fought Aurangzeb. But the truth should be known : Shivaji allowed his subjects freedom of religion and opposed forced conversion. The first thing Shivaji did after a conquest was to promulgate protection of mosques and Muslim tombs. One-third of his army was Muslim, as were many of his commanders: his most trusted general in all his campaigns was Haider Ali Kohari; Darya Sarang was chief of armoury; Ibrahim Khan and Daulat Khan were prominent in the navy; and Siddi Ibrahim was chief of artillery.
Aurangzeb was a cruel man, even to his own family: he killed his two brothers, threw his son in jail and had his father Shah Jahan imprisoned and later poisoned. Shivaji was the only one who stood up against him, at a time when Hindus were experiencing great oppression and humiliation: their temples were being broken, and they were being discriminated against in various forms, such as in the matter of charging custom duties, restrictions on their fairs and festivals, their dismissal from government posts, large-scale conversions as a part of openly declared policy of the Mughal State, imposition of the religious tax Jiziya for being a Hindu, and these discriminatory acts were going almost unchallenged though the Hindus formed more than bout 80 per cent of the population of the country.
Yet, Shivaji had respect for the Sufi tradition of Islam and used to pray at the mausoleum of the great Sufi Muslim saint Baba Sharifuddin. He also visited the abode of another great Sufi saint, Shaikh Yacub of the Konkan, and seeked his blessings. He called Hazrat Baba of Ratnagiri bahut thorwale bhau, meaning "great elder brother". Shivaji's feelings are reflected in a letter he wrote to Aurangzeb:: "Verily, Islam and Hinduism are terms of contrast. They are used by the true Divine Painter for blending the colours and filling in the outlines. If it is a mosque, the call to prayer is chanted in remembrance of him. If it is a temple, the bells are rung in yearning for him alone”. Shivaji also applied a humane and liberal policy to the women of his state, irrespective of their religion, nationality, or creed.
What to do then to remind all Indians of the great champion they had in Shivaji? I for one, am proud to announce that my foundation, FACT, which was created when I received the Natchiketa award of Excellence in Journalism at the hands of the Prime Minister in Parliament in 2003, has mounted an exhibition on Shivaji and that we are planning to release a book at the end of the year on his immense relevance to modern India (Har Anand publications, New Delhi). This is a small contribution of a foreigner, who loves India and think it is a wonderful country with great heroes.
Wake-up of my Indian brothers and sisters. You are a great nation, you have great heroes and Shivaji, certainly, is one of the most endearing ones : a Vibhuti, a direct incarnation of God, who walked upon this sacred soil of India, fearless and yet humane; a Giant of a Man, who could be reached by all. He was truly A Hero for Modern India.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, will seek on Friday to halt porn star Stormy Daniels’ defamation lawsuit, and Daniels’ attorney said he expected Cohen to refuse to testify if the effort fails.

Cohen notified U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Thursday he intends to request a stay in Daniels’ lawsuit against him and Trump “on the grounds that an ongoing criminal investigation overlaps with the facts of this case,” a reference to the possibility that his testimony could be used by prosecutors to build a related criminal case against Cohen.
Cohen, who has denied wrongdoing, has been at the centre of a controversy surrounding a $130,000 payment to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. She has alleged that she had sex once in 2006 with Trump and was paid shortly before the 2016 election to keep quiet about it. Daniels claims Cohen’s denials portray her as a liar and sued for defamation.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Cohen’s offices and home on Monday as part of a probe into possible bank and tax fraud and possible campaign law violation connected to the payment, a source familiar with the investigation told Reuters.
In the defamation-case filing, Cohen raised the possibility of invoking his constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination if the stay is not granted, which would allow him to refuse to testify.
Michael Avenatti, lawyer for Stormy Daniels told Reuters that Cohen’s attorney told him that Cohen will plead the Fifth if his application for a stay is denied.
Cohen’s attorney Brent Blakely said, “No decision has been made for Mr. Cohen to assert his Fifth Amendment rights.”
“It is common for a civil case to be stayed under these circumstances, and that is what we will be requesting of the U.S. District Court tomorrow,” Blakely said in an email.
Daniels has until Monday evening to file her opposition, and then Cohen will have through Tuesday evening to respond to her.
Guiding hand: one pro vice-chancellor suggested changes to the visa system had pushed more students to seek agents’ advice
UK universities’ commission payments to overseas recruitment agents have topped £86 million after rising sharply in recent years, a Times Higher Education investigation has found.
Data obtained from 158 higher education institutions under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that all but 19 elite or specialist institutions now use agents to enrol non-European Union students.
Of 106 that provided details of commission payments, their spending in 2013-14 totalled £86.7 million. This is a 16.5 per cent increase on the £74.4 million outlay two years earlier.
It appears that the increase is driven as much by rising commission rates as by expanding recruitment.
Across the 124 institutions that provided information on admissions, the number of international students enrolled using agents totalled 58,257 in 2013-14. This was up 6.4 per cent on the 2011-12 figure of 54,752.
The data suggest that agents were used to recruit a significant proportion of all non-EU learners studying at UK universities.
According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, 179,390 non-EU students started courses at all levels of study in the UK during 2013-14. The students listed in responses to THE alone account for 32.5 per cent of this total.
Commission payments may vary by institution, by agent and by market, but, based on figures from 101 institutions that provided information on both recruitment and spending, the average agent fee paid per student in 2013-14 was £1,767.
That still left substantial income for institutions, with average overseas undergraduate tuition fees for that year standing at £11,289 for classroom subjects and £13,425 for laboratory-based courses.
Vincenzo Raimo, pro vice-chancellor (global engagement) at the University of Reading, said that the figures demonstrated how British higher education institutions remained “incredibly reliant” on agents.
“I think in part this is due to increased competition both from within the UK but also elsewhere in the world. We have now seen US universities formally starting to work with agents and being aggressive in the market, and UK universities are having to respond in order to meet ever more ambitious recruitment targets,” said Mr Raimo.
“I think also the constant changes to the visa regime have forced more potential applicants into the hands of agents in order to help them through what they perceive to be a complicated and difficult process of applying for a student visa.”
The biggest spender, according to the responses to THE’s request, was Coventry University, which paid out £10.2 million in commission fees and VAT over the past three years. However, the university included fees paid to progression partners, such as providers of pre-degree courses, in its response.
The biggest spenders that provided answers for spending on recruitment agents alone were the University of Bedfordshire, which spent £9.5 million, and Middlesex University, which spent £8.8 million including VAT.
Twenty-seven institutions that use agents refused to reveal details of their commission payments, citing commercial confidentiality.
Coventry recruited the largest number of students using recruitment agents over the three-year period (5,634) – with those recruited via progression partners excluded for this answer.
Newcastle University was the second most active, recruiting 5,085 students using agents between 2011-12 and 2013-14.
Liz Reisberg, formerly of the Center for International Higher Education at Boston College in the US and now an independent consultant, described the amounts of money being spent on agents as “staggering”. Ms Reisberg said that universities could ensure higher standards by employing staff directly overseas.
“When you are spending so much money, why not spend it wisely…It would be better to invest in your own university and in your institutional capacity,” she added.
But Kevin Van-Cauter, higher education adviser at the British Council, said that agents played a useful role for institutions and students.
“For most universities, this is the most cost-effective way of recruiting, particularly where they may not have the staff or the budgets to cover certain countries, or to maintain a continued presence in that market in a way that will deliver the numbers for that institution,” he said.
“Agents play a crucial role in counselling and converting interest from students and their parents into ‘placements’ with institutions.”
Although there was little obvious correlation between entry tariffs and the use of agents, the universities that said they did not use agents included some of the UK’s most selective, such as the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and Imperial College London.
Among the 15 remaining Russell Group institutions that disclosed details of their commission payments, eight were among the biggest 20 spenders overall.

FILE - In this March 5, 2012 file photo, consumer credit cards are posed in North Andover, Mass.

It’s anything but difficult to see from that measurement alone why Mastercard get negative criticism. In case you’re not watchful with how you utilize credit, it could wreak ruin on your funds in an assortment of ways.
You may pile on so much unpaid liability it will take you years to pay off. You may wind up paying thousands in enthusiasm, to the inconvenience of your other money related objectives. Your FICO rating may get harmed simultaneously. There’s a great deal that could turn out badly in the event that you don’t utilize credit dependably.
Be that as it may, here’s the thing: Mastercards don’t need to be terrible. Utilizing a charge card doesn’t mean a programmed street to awful shopper obligation. In any case, you can wind up with that result in the event that you don’t instruct yourself about your Mastercards before you utilize them.
So begin savvy! Find out about credit and how your plastic functions previously piling on any charges for you.
In the first place, treat your charge card like a plastic. Try not to charge more than you can bear (regardless of what your credit confine is). Be aware of the amount you have in your financial balance so you don’t wind up in a circumstance where you can’t stand to pay your adjust. You need to have the capacity to pony up all required funds each month.
It’s additionally a smart thought to keep your adjust low. In the event that you have a credit point of confinement of $5,000, that doesn’t mean you ought to have an adjust of $4,500 toward the finish of the month — regardless of whether you can manage the cost of it. How much obligation you owe is considered into your FICO assessment. On the off chance that you maximize your cards, your FICO rating may endure.
It’s a given you should make convenient installments. In the event that you don’t, you can get hit with a late charge and a ding on your credit. Set a suggestion to pay your bill, or set up programmed installments.
In conclusion, just purchase what you require. This backpedals to treating your charge card like a platinum card. Credit isn’t free cash. You’ll need to pay sooner or later. Just utilize your charge card for routine shopping and arranged buys inside your financial plan.
There are a couple of key terms you should know when utilizing Visas. Being educated will spare you from committing some expensive errors.
A standout amongst the most vital things you ought to comprehend is the yearly rate, or APR. In the event that you neglect to fork over the required funds, you’ll be charged the APR on all or part of your outstanding equalization. This implies what you initially acquired for $20 may wind up costing you $25 one month from now.
As another illustration, if your Visa conveys a rate of 20%, you’ll pay $20 for each $100 you charge. This is the reason forking over the required funds each month is basic!
You need the most minimal APR accessible, yet be careful with limited time offers. A few cards have low basic rates for a year which increment thereafter.
Various charge cards, particularly those that guarantee rewards or focuses, likewise have yearly expenses. This expense will be charged amid your first charging cycle, albeit a few items will postpone the charge for the main year and begin charging it in the second year. Read the fine print before agreeing to accept a charge card on the off chance that you need one without a yearly expense.
Late charges additionally apply on the off chance that you neglect to make an installment inside a specific day and age (more often than not 21 days). On the off chance that you’ve beforehand made auspicious installments, you might have the capacity to get a late expense deferred, yet don’t rely on it. Late expenses are topped at $25 for first-time wrongdoers and $35 for visit guilty parties under the Credit Card Act of 2009.
When you get your announcement, you’ll see there’s a base installment you can make. Least installments look reasonable contrasted with your adjust more often than not, however you need to calculate intrigue the condition.
Whenever you leave a part of your adjust unpaid, intrigue will accumulate on that adjust. On the off chance that you keep making charges on your card, while paying the base owed, you won’t have the capacity to find up to paying your adjust off.
You may have caught wind of the advantages of prizes cards. When you influence buys with a prizes to card, you get focuses to recover for movement, money back, and different products. Sounds like a pleasant arrangement, isn’t that so?
Truly, however just on the off chance that you take after the rules said before. Try not to charge all that you can consider for the sake of getting focuses.
Visa organizations can offer these rewards in light of individuals who utilize credit untrustworthily. They’ll wind up paying enthusiasm on their equalizations, and the free cash winds up not being free all things considered.
Remember that Visa organizations don’t furnish you with an “arrangement” to be decent — there’s a reason they offer reward focuses. They gain a benefit off the financing costs charged to the individuals who don’t (or can’t) pay off parities.
Prizes cards and the focuses you can “procure” just advantage you in the event that you restrain yourself to ordinary spending you effectively anticipated. The minute you begin charging more to your card with an end goal to snatch more focuses is the minute that prizes cards turn into a danger to your monetary circumstance.
Charge cards accompany numerous “security” includes that different techniques for installment need. When you charge something on your Visa, it doesn’t instantly deduct anything from your financial records and you’re not out any money until the point when you pay that Visa charge.
This is something worth being thankful for regarding guarding against false movement and missteps on your announcement.
In the event that you paid with money, you could conceivably recover that cash. You can simply question a charge on your Visa. Also, on the off chance that you pay with a check card? Keep in mind, this is like trade and the cash out your record is taken out when that exchange posts.
In case you’re a casualty of misrepresentation or need to debate the charge, you might possibly recover that cash.
Many individuals are staunchly against utilizing credit when you could stay with your charge cards or utilize just money. Also, there’s a justifiable reason explanation behind this: in the event that you can’t deal with your accounts or control your spending, your Visas can quick track you into budgetary calamity.
In any case, while that is a probability, it isn’t the administer for Mastercard clients. There are many points of interest and reasons why others incline toward utilizing credit over charge or money.
Similarly as with numerous individual fund issues, there may not be one right answer in the matter of regardless of whether you should utilize charge cards. In case you’re attempting to grow great cash propensities, it may be keen to stick to money or charge for the time being until the point that you can better deal with your cash.
Recently, in a Russian media interview, Timofey Mozgov was inquired about the possibility of playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers to join forces with LeBron James. Although, the Russian native commended James, as well as head coach, David Blatt, he never demanded a trade or expressed a desire to actually play for Cleveland.
“Of course, it would be interesting to play for David Blatt’s team. I know his coaching philosophy well, after working with him on the Russian national team,” said Mozgov. “I would like to play with LeBron. But even though playing for a contender is cool, you got to understand that I want to be a part of the team and not just join a contender and ride the coattails, being a burden.”
As expected, these comments in addition to the Cavs need for rim protection sparked a media frenzy. Obviously, the networks had a field day with this quote, sparking all sorts of rumors, despite Mozgov not demanding a trade.
“So far all the talks about trade to Cleveland are just rumors. My last season in Denver was good, and to try and do something to leave the team wouldn’t be smart.”
Although, Cleveland expressed a desire for a defensive rim presence, an exchange with the Denver Nuggets is unlikely.
Furthermore, the Cavaliers are reluctant to surrender anyone of value. The contracts that appear expendable are those of John Lucas III, Malcolm Thomas, and Erik Murphy. With the exception of $100,000 in Murphy’s deal, these players can be acquired and waived without expense. Additionally, Brendan Haywood is someone who could be involved in a deal as well, as Cleveland’s search for a backup center continues.
Initially, Haywood was acquired via a trade with the Charlotte Hornets this off-season. Although Haywood is a 12 year veteran and NBA champion, injuries have been a concern. The center has registered 70 plus games in just six out of 12 seasons, including a missed 13’-14’ campaign due to a foot injury. His $2 million due this year plus his nonguaranteed $10.5 million the following season makes Haywood an appealing trading chip.
Providing that a trade is successful, the Cavaliers would gain a developing, young asset. In his previous three seasons, Mozgov never appeared in more than 45 games a season. Last year, he played in 82 games with 30 starts. The Russian set career highs with 9.4 points, 6.4 rebounds, 0.8 assists, and 1.2 blocks per game. The incorporation of his offensive potential would help, but his defensive presence would strike fear into the hearts of opponents.

As an experimental composer, Patton’s bohemian compositions blur the lines between two distinct genres: classical music and heavy metal. Though an extreme example, Patton’s musical panache underlines how genres can become somewhat irrelevant when classifying certain styles of music. At best, genres enable listeners to place music into neat categories by classifying different melodic styles and sounds, but all too often listeners use genres as an echo chamber for their musical tastes. When relied on too heavily, genres pigeonhole listeners into a singular music type instead of fostering exploration into the vast corners and subtle recesses of music.
“I hate country music” and “punk music sucks” are common sayings music listeners throw around reflexively. Some listeners refuse to even hear songs from certain genres. Though listeners can point to legitimate reasons for dismissing entire genres, such as the often-formulaic lyricism of pop country and the ever-growing popularity of mumble rap in hip-hop, these precepts encourage musical stagnation instead of exploration. A solution is to reduce the power of genres which can help listeners find new and enjoyable music. Country music doubters may be surprised at the raw emotion and musical brilliance of Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson, and punk skeptics may find elements of early rock in punk-group The Ramones and Irish folk in Dropkick Murphys. Listeners who abandon genre stereotypes open their musical horizon to new expanses and discover new bands and musical varieties that they otherwise would have overlooked.
Above: Though unlikely to show up together in a Spotify or Pandora radio station, Alt-J and Frank Ocean share similar music styles and even lyrical themes. Source: Festival Snobs and Genius.
If not genres, how can listeners categorize music? Genres offer an easy classification method, but there are instrumental, stylistic, rhythmic, cultural, and myriad other methods to classify music. Compare Frank Ocean’s song “Solo” off Blonde to Alt J’s hit “Tessellate” from their debut album An Awesome Wave: both songs feature slow verse progressions, echoing piano chords, and cathartic vocal crescendos. Alt-J, self-classified as “alternative dub-pop”, seems fundamentally different from Frank Ocean, who has been placed in Spotify’s R&B genre. Yet, these artists share similar melodic and singing styles. And these musical networks are everywhere: Tame Impala fans can find psychedelic nuggets in songs produced by rapper Flying Lotus; fans of indie folk group The Head and the Heart may unearth how the band’s twanging guitars and lyrical themes share similarities with early country legend Johnny Cash. When listeners limit themselves to select genres, they severely constrain chances to discover and savor these musical networks interlacing genres to other genres.
Popular music listening platforms like Spotify and Pandora, claiming to have magical algorithms that select songs for listeners through their radio and “Discovery Weekly” features, employ a genre-centric music discovery process. On Spotify, clicking on the “Related Artist” tab usually yields an extensive assortment of bands in an analogous genre with extremely similar music styles. Alt-J never appears as a related artist for Frank Ocean, and Tame Impala rarely enters a Beatles Pandora station. Though music listening platforms have intricate algorithms that can help listeners find new music, they still follow a timeworn model for choosing songs based predominately off genre instead of countless other ways to categorize music, like syncopation and lyric themes.
Above: Spotify genre and mood playlists offer limited variation in the musical styles of songs within each classification. Source: Spotify.
Like politics, listeners should not linger within echo chambers that confirm their own proclivities. Music is a vast form of expression and art best enjoyed through exploration, and music listening platforms like Spotify and Pandora should cultivate musical discover by reconfiguring radio and streaming algorithms on the basis of more multifaceted features in music—or at least allow listeners to search music by other classifications besides simply genre or mood. But most importantly, listeners should stop thinking about music in terms of genres. Music is a melting pot, and pigeonholing yourself into one musical style is not only unproductive—it’s looking at an entire form of art through a single dimension.

Peak season does mean the parks are open for extended hours. But despite the crowds, Walt Disney World doesn’t emphasize the Easter holiday as much as, say, the Christmas holiday season or even Halloween. It doesn’t offer much décor or throw a special Easter Parade, for instance.
However, there are some Easter events that tend to occur annually that guests can incorporate into their travel itineraries. Easter theme-park activities differ from park to park, with some of the most delightful activities taking place at Epcot. And Walt Disney World will a few special events – especially dining experiences or resort activities for children – to observe the holiday.
Specific information, such as dates and locations, concerning Disney’s Easter events for each year are released very close to the holiday period and guests.
Magic Kingdom holds Disney character meet & greet opportunities with the Easter Bunny. Mr. and Mrs. Bunny appear intermittently for pictures at City Hall from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m from March 28 – April 4. Various Disney characters will appear in Easter costumes for the Sunday Easter Parade, held at 3 p.m. Two parades will be thrown from March 28 – 31, at noon (special parade time) and 3 p.m. (the regular parade time).
On Easter, Epcot holds Easter egg hunts in the World Showcase, at the American Adventure’s Heritage Garden for Disney guests ages 3 to 9 years. Easter Egg relays are also held, for guests ages 6 to 12, at Future World near Innoventions West. Times for the Easter egg hunts are every 30 minutes from 10:00 a.m. to 5:20 p.m; ever 40 minutes for the relays, from 10:40 a.m. to 4:40 p.m.
Animal Kingdom holds storytelling sessions with Pocahontas and character meet & greets at the Good Time Gathering Spot, located at Camp Minnie-Minnie. Guests can meet Thumper and Miss Bunny, among others, during the holiday period. They appear at 10:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m on Easter Sunday, and the Easter Bunny appears at 2:30 p.m.
Moderate and Deluxe Walt Disney World Resorts offer a variety of children’s activities on Easter Sunday. Most of these host the popular “candy scrambles” for children ages 12 and under. Other activities, which vary by resort, include character meet & greet opportunities, bunny races, egg, t-shirt, and puppet painting sessions, Easter-themed crafts, pool parties, jelly-bean tastings, and cookie decorating. Times and locations for candy scrambles and other activities are provided to Disney Resort guests; check with the resorts front desk or recreation department.
In the past, an Easter Buffet has been offered at Epcot’s World ShowPlace Pavilion (the location is between Canada and the UK), and is served between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. The brunch, like others in Disney World, includes a variety of options: eggs and omelets, breads and cereals, fruits, salads, soups, chicken, pasta, beef, and desserts. Kids stations serve favorites like macaroni and cheese and pizza.
There has been no confirmation of this year’s buffet, so call to check. Buffet prices were $47.99 (guests ages 10 and older) and $19.99 (ages 3 – 9) in last year. For the Easter buffet, theme-park admission and advance dining reservations are required.
Other locations that regularly offer special Easter Sunday meals include (locations vary somewhat each year):
Disney’s Advance Dining Reservations are highly recommended for all table-service dining during a holidays and peak seasons. Holiday pricing may be in effect for restaurants – including character meals and buffets –during the extended Easter period as well as on Easter Sunday. Call 407-WDW-DINE (407-939-3463) to inquire about special meals and prices.
Sunday Easter services ¬– held on April 4– will be held at the Fantasia Ballroom, located at Contemporary Resort, according to the following schedule:
Guests may not park at the Contemporary to attend Easter Services. Guests staying at a monorail resort should use the monorail or watercraft to travel to the Contemporary. Guests staying at other Disney resorts and at off-site accommodations should use Disney transportation to the Magic Kingdom; a shuttle bus will take them to the Contemporary. Monorail resorts – Contemporary, Polynesian, and Grand Floridian – will have parking restrictions in effect.
Visiting Walt Disney World during Easter may mean more crowds, especially inside the theme parks. But the two weeks surrounding Easter can also be a great time to visit for those who want to celebrate the holiday and beginning of spring. It’s a recommended time to visit, especially for Disney resort guests who take advantage of Epcot area’s activities, dining, and special children’s activities.

When a British student produced his own version of a Christmas advertisement for retailer John Lewis (release of the real advert is a popular fixture on the calendar here), he probably had no idea it would go viral ... or lead to an actual job offer.
London PR agency W Communications were quick make a pitch to the A-level (sort of like high school) producer, figuring they just might land a new Steven Spielberg, or at least get a little attention for being quick at spotting hot creative talent. A win either way.
And for those looking to break in to agency life: it's never too early to start producing stuff to make your case.

I'm just curious. I started chewing ice about 6 months ago. My research led me to believe that I could quite possibly be anemic. Depression was also brought up when I was talking with others. I am interested in hearing anything that you have heard, and/or know for a fact about this subject.
If you are anemic, then the absence of blood can cause changes in your body chemistry that can lead to depression. This and/or the psychological effects of being weak perpetually may be affecting you as well.

I've been sitting on the ground, where everything was white, no walls, no skies, no actual ground, just white emptiness. So I was sitting or levitating, wherever I was, and I've been solving some sort of puzzle in front of me while talking to mysterious, shadowy figure next to me. The puzzle was classic puzzle, although, it wasn't a picture or anything, it also looked like I was missing pieces. The piece I took and placed down had a blue symbol on it, I don't remember what shape it had or what it looked like. While solving the puzzle I was talking to some sort of figure that was sitting beside me, talking to me in enthusiastic way while using some body language, and watching me solving the puzzle, while I've been responding in indifferent and emotionless way, like I wasn't interested, yet decided to keep the conversation going, or maybe perhaps I was in deep thinking state trying to figure out something (maybe the puzzle). I don't know. The figure was pitch black, more like a shadow actually, looked like human, yet had nothing but a mouth, just a face, no eyes, ears, hair, anything else, just a mouth. That's pretty much all I can remember, I have no idea what we were talking about, also I can't tell my relationship with that figure. Any ideas what the dream could mean?
Last night I was in a western film where clint eastwood and john wayne were the bad guys. I shot john wayne but clint was too fast for me in a dual and I died IMD.
last night I dreamt that the whole world was full of these zombie like creatures. So I was standing in my house while the neighbours where having a barbecue next door. But all of a sudden the all got bitten and become zombies. Me and my family and friends were the last survivors. I was looking in the cupboard and found these pink ankle socks so I decided to try them on. I had the power to fly!!. It was amazing because the zombies couldn't reach me. It felt so amazing being able to fly IMD

Hello everybody from Italy! I almost never remember my dreams, and when I do they are never too realistic. But this one was definitely one of the weirdest, most realistic and vivid dreams of my life, so I want to share it with you. I am walking on a street in the historical centre of some small town. It's a sunny and bright day and there are people around. Suddenly, I sense the presence of two people behind me. One of them puts his arms around my torso and I hear a male voice say (in German): "Ach, mein Freund!" (Ah, my friend),as if this person knew me, but with a fake, upsetting cheerful tone. I get scared and manage to wiggle out of his hold. Although I'm now free, I bite his arm to defend myself, the consistency of his arm is similar to that of marshmallows,and I don't hurt him at all. I finally turn around and see the two people: the man who grabbed me is an overall normal person, his head is bold except for short curly brown hair on either side. He is smiling mockingly at me, probably because I failed to hurt him. The other person is a middle-aged woman, with a stern angular face, a bob haircut, hair colour between brown and dark red. She has a serious expression, but not evil. She says something else in German, which I can't understand, and then, In English, these exact words: "Tomorrow you will come to utter and complete death" (I don't even know if such a sentence really makes sense in English, death IS utter and complete by definition). At this point, I can no longer understand anything of what's going on and I try to say something (I guess so, I don't remember exactly). The man then says (this time in my mother language, Italian), with the same mocking smile, "I am the dwarf croupier (stakeholder) and tomorrow you will die" (the weird thing is that he is NOT a dwarf). Then the dream ends. Or maybe there's more, but that's all I remember. That's really really weird. If my subconscious was trying to tell me something, it must be retarded (LOL), cause it could choose one of the languages I speak/understand (Italian, English, French, Russian, Spanish or even Romanian) but it spoke German, which I don't speak, except for a few words. It is also very very uncommon for me to dream in a foreign language, or more than one. It only happened one or two times before. Anyway, 24 hours have passed by now, and I seem to be fine so far. What do you guys think about it?

Are you shy? Don't worry, Rammstein's Olli knows all about it. The last week we have heard him out about his teens and guess what? He didn't even dare to talk with girls....
Oliver:Quite normal, I think. I went just like all the other teenagers to the disco and hang around on the corner of the street. I was just very shy. I didn't even dare to talk to a dog!
Oliver:In a new neighbourhood of a town in former East-Germany. Was that boring? Not at all! Everyone knew one and another and there were lots of places to play and enough places to hang-around. I liked it anyway.
Oliver:Me? Oh no. Although... if my mother came to wake me up in the morning to say that I had to go to school, I could cross the line a bit, haha.
Oliver:Not a lot at all. My parents are quite young, which is good. Because the age difference isn't that big, we had it good with each other. My father and mother also liked the same music as me. We were almost more like friends the family.
Oliver:No, because I don't have any, too bad. But if I would have had them, I would definetly have teased them!
Oliver:I have seen the inside from that disco a lot, yes. Not to dance, I was much to shy to do that! I just hang around and when the lights went on, I went home. On my moped? No, I didn't even have that. But my friends did, and they were good enough that they didn't mind lending me their two-wheeler.
Oliver:No, Because at that time I didn't drink yet. I thought beer and all those drinks were disgusting. Only when I came to work as a trainee-plasterer I started taking-in. My colleges thought it is suppose to be that way, in the work we did! I started slowly drinking beer and vodka-cola.
Oliver:Wild party's? No girls ever came to our party's because we didn't dare to even talk to them! I will never forget my first party. There were fifteen guys and zero girls, haha!
Oliver:Later it went a bit better. Although, then my friend dared to talk to some girls. We gave a party with four guys and had invited six girls! When they rang the doorbell, we firstly didnt dare to answer it because of the nerves, but it became a good time later on.
Oliver:One time. I saw a wooden little boat in a shop that I wanted to have. Before I knew it I had taken it. But I felt so guilty that when I came home I told my mother immediatley. No, I didn't get a punishment, she was already happy I told it.
Oliver: When you are about fifteen, sixteen everyone wants to know, how far you can go? Well, me too.
Oliver: Bad! But I am not sure whether it was because of me. We had real bad teachers that really couldn't explain. Also they had different views on things then the students, so it wasn't all that great.
Oliver: Not much. My mother thought it was ridiculous that I had such terrible teachers and she knew I hated school.
We’ve probably all been in a situation where we felt the need to justify or ‘legitimise’ our behaviour or actions in some way. This legitimisation usually takes the form of providing arguments which can explain our actions or even our opinions about something. There can be many reasons why we do this; to gain social acceptance; perhaps an attempt to get or maintain power; to improve relationships or maybe to achieve popularity or fame. Whatever the reason, in most cases when we do this, we’re looking to get the support or approval of the person or people that we’re talking to.
A good example of where we see this process of legitimisation in action is in political discourse. Politicians (or ‘political actors’) need the support of the electorate and they must therefore justify their actions, non-actions or their ideological standing on a particular issue in order to gain that support. Researcher Antonio Reyes suggests that speakers use five key strategies of legitimisation in order to achieve their political goals. They are: 1) emotions (particularly fear), 2) a hypothetical future, 3) rationality, 4) voices of expertise and 5) altruism. To illustrate how these strategies are employed, Reyes uses examples from speeches given by two leaders in two different armed conflicts, George W. Bush on Iraq (2007) and Barack Obama on Afghanistan (2009), with both speakers seeking to justify military presence in what has become known as the ‘War on Terror’.
Reyes says that the first strategy uses an appeal to emotions which allows the speaker to ‘skew the opinion’ of the audience about a specific issue. He states that since 2001, political leaders have often drawn on the events of 9/11 to activate people’s emotions in order to legitimise future actions. The date is so engraved in people’s memories that any mention of it sets off the emotions related to the event. So when Bush said (11 Jan 2007) ‘These are the same folks that came and killed about 3,000 of our citizens’ (all bold font appears in original article) and Obama said (1 Dec 2009) ‘On September 11 2001, 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000 people’ Reyes suggests that the sentences trigger emotions which are ideal to later ‘legitimise political actions based on the effect of those emotions’.
Another strategy that Reyes identifies is one of posing a hypothetical threat in the future to justify actions in the present. In this case the political actor usually refers to a cause in the past (here 9/11) which may happen again in the future and which therefore requires action in the present in order to stop that future threat. Reyes provides an example from Bush (11 Jan 2007) when he said ‘If we were to fail in Iraq, the enemy would follow us here to America’.
The third strategy is legitimisation through rationality. Here, the political actor is said to present the legitimisation process as a process where all the options have been considered and a decision has been reached after a ‘heeded, evaluated and thoughtful’ procedure. Linguistically, the strategy is often framed by clauses such as ‘after consultation with our allies’ or verbs relating to mental and verbal processes such as ‘explore’ and ‘consult’.
The fourth strategy is to draw on voices of expertise to strengthen the politician’s position. An example given comes from Bush (11 Jan 2007) when he said ‘and so our commanders looked at the plan and said, Mr President, it’s not going to work until – unless we support – provide more troops.......’ where a direct quote is used from authoritative figures who have been consulted for their expert opinions.
Reyes final strategy is one of altruism, meaning that political actors will often propose their actions as being beneficial to others. Examples are taken from the speech of Bush (11 Jan 2007) who said ‘It’s time to act not only for our sake, it’s time to act for the sake of the people in Iraq’ and Obama (1 Dec 2009) who said ‘Thanks to their courage, grit and perseverance, we have given Iraqis a chance to shape their future, and we are successfully leaving Iraq to its people’. Reyes states that actions are more likely to be accepted if they are framed as being beneficial to others, particularly towards the poor, innocent or vulnerable members of a society.
In his conclusion, Reyes claims that even though these two political figures have differing ideologies and that they use very different styles to present their arguments, they nevertheless employ similar strategies to legitimise their political agendas. Of course, political discourse may be said to be planned or pre-planned and Reyes calls for further studies to test the strategies in other speech events, suggesting that such strategies may also be used in casual conversation.

The oldest known version of the "webinfo" directory, then named Webmaster's Reference Desk , now known as WebReference.com . Uses tables, which were de rigueur at the time, and has no logo, just nav buttons to the other parts of my home page (poetry, pictures of pets, etc.).
An expanded version of the previous page. I changed the name a number of times, and arrived at the Webmaster Reference Library , going for that one-to-one personalization. Discovered Alan Richmond's fine WDVL, then with 1,100 sites and two years old (now owned by Jupitermedia Corporation).
Ditched the table in this version circa September 1995. It's a humble little page, with links to other pages of links and some of my own articles. Still part of my home page. It uses HTML 2, and is readable by all browsers.
New logo, a spider-like creature with interlocking legs. Have some initial awards and am soliciting feedback here. Start working with Robert Peyser on site (future partner).
Switch to domain name webreference.com. In anticipation of the press making screen shots of our site, we created a large "webreference.com" banner and put it at the top of our page. This actually paid off and it was seen in a few magazines. This version used a minimalist splash page approach.
Our Zen period. We had some fun brainstorming in the early days, and this version is the result of one of our more creative sessions. We thought "candy" was like freebies or goodies, and invited people to "yak bak" and read about the site's "lore." Note the graphics-heavy treatment, and graphical text versions of the spider heads. The second page instructs people to "BEGIN HERE" and "GO THERE" and finally "BE HERE NOW." This page went to a randomly generated Zen Koan. Ohhhhmmmm.

If you have ever seen the old TV show, Fantasy Island, then you probably remember the opening scenes featuring beautiful waterfalls and "Tattoo" shouting his famous, " ...da plane, da plane..," from the bell tower.
Those double falls are actually Wailua Falls on Kauai. The falls cascade over 175 feet over a huge pool bellow. That's 16 stories! The falls are spectacular. If you have had the opportunity to witness them in person, then you will connect with my sentiments. Our family make it a point to visit Wailua Falls every time that we are on Kauai...It is absolutely breath taking. Photos alone cannot capture the Fall's true beauty. However, here are a few shots anyway.
Early in the day is the best time to view the falls. As the sun is shinning through the mist, you can often see rainbows.
So you can get an idea just how tall the falls are and how huge the pool is...check out those two people. Can you see them? They're just south of the center of the photo.
Do not leave the island with out seeing these falls--seriously! Head south from Kapaa on 56 (Kuhio Highway), turn right onto Maalo Road (583). Drive a mile or two inland (mauka) and you'll reach a turn out with parking. Take a few minutes to REALLY see the falls; it'd be a shame to just snap a photo and leave. You'll be so happy you stayed!
Update 24 May 2010: I have added some more features to Dropbox and I have released my new “Dropoff” over at www.dropoff.me. Get all the latest and greatest there in future!
I have found a great solution to the common problem of sending and receiving files from other sites and research partners, and generally sending large files around the web where email won’t do the trick.
I am launching it as a service at work called “Dropoff” in order that people don’t think you are talking about the service provided by www.dropbox.com which is a totally different thing.
The idea is that you don’t even need to login to send a file to a user within your site/company/University/institution, so external people can use it to send files to people in your institution. It can handle arbitrarily large files, there are no fixed limits. If you log in to the Dropbox website, you can send files to people outside your institution. People who cannot log in can only send files to people within your institution. This stops the rest of the world using it to send people to other people who aren’t members of your institution.
I have customised it quite a bit just for our site, so if you want a copy of my patched version, along with a guide as to what changes I have made, then please contact me.
Unfortunately someone screwed up the installation of one of our servers so that mail to local addresses was being delivered into /var/spool/mail/ instead of being sent onwards to our SMTP server.
Getting the sendmail.mc correct was the easy bit, there is a simple “null client” sendmail.mc file I wrote years ago which does that nicely.
The hard bit was taking all the Unix mbox files in /var/spool/mail and /var/mail and re-delivering them all to their intended recipients. The bit most people get wrong is the separator between messages. The separator is not a line starting with “From “. The separator is a blank line followed by a line starting with “From “. So I wrote my own script to do it which you are very welcome to download and use.
The Converter is a client/server program, where the converter server runs on ecsvm-admin.ecs and the client can run anywhere, such as win-admin.
If the source physical Windows system is in the DMZ, you will need to add a couple of rules to the firewall "Short-Term Rules" section allowing all traffic from ECS-internal to the source host and from the source host to ECS-internal. You should remove these rules again once the conversion has completed.
Username = administrator (or your own sys* username if you are registered on the vSphere with an account).
Give username and password of a user in the "Administrators" group on the source Windows system, such as the "ECS2000\administrator" account and domain password..
When it asks for the name of the source system to convert, give it the IP address of the source system (which is the same system you are now running the Converter on).
Set all large, non-swap filesystems to "Thin provisioning" (this is "Dynamic disks" in Microsoft speak, where only the disk space in use is actually allocated on disk, used disk space expands as necessary to hold the data, up to the maximum set by the size of the filesystem).
Set the Size of the normal large filesystems (eg. "C:") to a reasonable number, no point in making them huge, most will fit in 60Gbytes.
It is important not to waste disk space on Flat-provisioned disks that are not going to use all their space. Disk is relatively expensive.
Set the network for the network adapter to be the same Virtual Machine Network VLAN as the physical machine you are converting.
Services: Source Services: switch off services that should not be left running when the VM is created (such as SQL Server or WWW Publishing Service, and Hyper-V services if moving from Hyper-V to VMware). Destination Services: set all Hyper-V services to "Disabled".
It should now just show you the final option settings and then start the process of converting the host. Wait for the whole process to finish before touching either the source (physical) or destination (virtual) machines.
How long it takes depends on the quantity of data that has to be moved. You can expect about 20 to 25 MBytes/second conversion speed. A machine with about 7GB of used disk takes about 25 minutes to convert.
As the process is run by the Converter Server (running on ecsvm-admin), it doesn't matter if you quit the Windows app used to watch the process, you can track the progress of the conversion from the Converter Windows app running on any PC.
If the source physical Linux system is in the DMZ, you will need to add a couple of rules to the firewall "Short-Term Rules" section allowing all traffic from ECS-internal to the source host and from the source host to ECS-internal. You should remove these rules again once the conversion has completed.
On the final virtual machine, you will need to install the VMware tools and set the VM settings to synchronise the time on the VM with that of the ecsvm-admin server. So you won't want ntpd to be running. Also, you are going to need to reboot the VM at least once after you have converted it, so stop and disable the primary user services (e.g. httpd, mysqld) that are running on the server. You can start up the user services again as the last step after getting the VM Linux system running. So I would start with
Also, if the physical source machine is actually a Windows 2008 Hyper-V VM, then you will want to do the same to the "inputvsc" service, and copy the seth0 device settings to eth0 (remembering to change the device name in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 after copying the ifcfg-seth0 file onto it) as VMware will use the eth0 device and not the seth0 device.
Once running in VMware, the kernel will need to be able to "probe" the disk controllers in order to be able to find the controller types. So in /boot/grub/grub.conf, edit the kernel command line arguments and remove any settings that set "hda=noprobe" or similar. You don't need to reboot after this change, this will be applied once the VM conversion has finished and VMware starts the new VM.
Set the Size of the normal large filesystems (eg. "/") to a reasonable number, no point in making them huge, most will fit in 40Gbytes.
Helper VM Network: Look up the IP address of the host "ecsvm--helper" which is a spare IP address unused by anything else in the same "" as the physical host you are converting. There are currently hosts defined such as "ecsvm-systems-helper", "ecsvm-dmz-helper" and "ecsvm-servers-helper". The IP configuration parameters and DNS setup for the Helper VM Network must all be consistent with its IP address. This "helper" machine is a temporary system setup by the VMware Converter just for use during the process of converting a Linux box, it disappears again at the end.
The VM should now be fully running happily and serving its services to the users. If you prefer, you can always reboot the VM again instead of running those last two "service ... start" commands to prove it is all okay and booting correctly.
Accept all the defaults, and let it do everything it wants. If you have a fully updated and correct system, it should install flawlessly.
Check the "ifconfig -a" and ensure that all the network devices that exist have startup scripts in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth*.
Go into the vSphere Client again and right-click on the VM. Look in the "Guest" sub-menu and tell it to stop installing the VMware Tools if it offers you that.
The most likely problem is that you are running an el5xen kernel or some other xen kernel, which you don't want to be doing.
Once you've done a yum update, take the xen kernel you are running (uname -a will tell you) and do something like this:
Then edit /boot/grub/grub.conf and ensure that the "default=" setting at the top is set to boot the kernel you just installed and not the xen kernel (they start numbering from the top of the file from 0).
You need to change the installed SCSI controller to be a LSI Logic controller. The original machine may have been configured for a Transtec 3Ware SCSI controller.
Once the VM has been converted, you can change the hardware of the VM in the "Edit Settings..." menu from right-clicking on the VM. You can only change it when the VM is powered off.
Work out the full path to the initrd image you are going to rebuild. They are in /boot and are called initrd*.
This is how to add mouse support to the LICs (Linux Integration Components) provided by Microsoft. This does not involve using the Beta version of the LICs at all, it is all done with the production release version.
Firstly install everything else involved in getting the LICs working. There is another article in this blog that will explain how to get the LICs working with RedHat or CentOS 5.2.
Using the Hyper-V “Connect” window and its Media menu, set the DVD drive to point to the “inputvsc.iso” you just downloaded.
Start X Windows with “startx” to test it. If the mouse support doesn’t work, you can always kill X by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Backspace, or by logging in remotely to the virtual machine as root and typing “killall X”.
Update: 29th December 2008 - I have compacted the original vhd files rather better, and the total download for each version is now about 2.3 Gbytes.
To make life easier for everyone, I have put together a couple of VHD files for Hyper-V that contain a pre-built x86 and x86_64 (x64) distribution of CentOS 5.2 including pre-installed Linux Integration Components. They are fully patched up to date, including the latest kernel version available, as of Christmas 2008.
On a Windows system you can join these together into the .vhd file with the command (in a normal Command Prompt window)
Then just build a virtual machine around each one with the .vhd file as the IDE hard disk, and with a Network Adapter (not a Legacy Network Adapter) in it.
and then run the command “setup” to configure the IP address and so on of the “seth0” network device. Then just reboot and you’re away.
If you need a graphical interface with a mouse and such, then change the “3” to a “5” in the “default” line in /etc/inittab and reboot. But I would advise leaving it in text-only mode.
There are a few things you can do to speed up the ext3 filesystem, and when combined they make a lot of difference!
Firstly, you probably don’t need to store the “last accessed” time of every file and/or every directory, so add “noatime,nodiratime” to the mount options in /etc/fstab (add a comma then that text straight after the word “defaults” in the relevant line of /etc/fstab).
Furthermore, you can optimise the caching of data in the filesystem by adding “data=writeback” to the mount options in /etc/fstab. This is pretty safe as long as your system isn’t very busy and liable to lose power without warning. The only downside is that should it lose power while writing to the disk, a few files may end up with slightly old content in them.
The last one is a little more complicated, but well worth doing. You can change the directories to be B-trees instead of lists, which are a lot faster if you have many files in each directory. Say your filesystem is mounted off /dev/sdb1, for example.
There are a few things you can do to speed up the operation of ext3 filesystems, by changing some of the ways in which it behaves by default.
This is all for /dev/sda1, change it to suit the partition you are working with. Make sure you have an ext3 filesystem on there already, and ensure you have unmounted the filesystem first.
Many people have asked me how to extract the file embedded inside an OLE object that has been inserted into a Microsoft Word document, or similar.
I reverse-engineered the file format, it’s very simple. Not this code doesn’t always appear to work, but it gets 95% of them out.
Use it at your own peril. Please credit me (Julian Field jules@jules.fm) where/when/if you use this code or any derivative of it, including translations into other languages.

I think the photo above (via friend and VCFA-colleague Louise Hawes) is a poem in itself- no text necessary. But since I'm on the subject of the moon, here is something Italo Calvino said about the work of Giacomo Leopardi, the great Italian poet:
Now that seems like good writing advice to me - Attend to lightness. Shoot for moonlight. I sang lots of songs about the moon to my grandson these last two weeks while he was staying with us in Seattle. Oh, Mr. Moon, Moon, bright and shiny moon, won't you please shine down on me? and When the moon comes over the mountains, every beam brings a dream, dear of you....and we read the lovely story in Owl at Home by Arnold Lobel which contains the lines, "Oh, Moon, you have followed me all the way home. What a good round friend you are!"
2010 seems to have been the Year of the Moon for me. I wonder what 2011 will be? Here is a small poem about the moon by H. D. (Hilda Doolittle).
Hope your year is wonderful. Here is a small poem (2010 was a year of small poems, too) by Robert Herrick about the good luck I wish for you in the new year. I'm passing it along - it came to me via the wonderful owners of Open Books, Christine Deavel and John Marshall (they have a calendar of strong readers coming up...if you live in the Pacific Northwest and love poetry, check it out.)

My 3-year-old grandson has been staying with me for the last week while my daughter and her husband take a long-overdue vacation. I've been immersed in Lego's, Lightning McQueen race cars (and tow trucks), tents made of sheets over the dining room table, and gingerbread-cookie-making sessions. There have been rubber ducks in the bathtub and six stories at bedtime just about every night because I can't resist it when he begs, "One more...please?" Owl at Home by Arnold Lobel has been a favorite, ditto Make Way for Ducklings.
Just about all of it has been glorious. I'd forgotten, though, how specific 3-year-olds can be about what they want to eat- I mean, down to the smallest details, the way an egg is scrambled, the amount of milk on cereal, the proper way to cut pizza. the way a piece of toast is buttered ("Nobody / he whimpered / "Could call me / a fussy man....") Here's one of my favorite A.A. Milne poems - I've been thinking of it while fixing meals this week:

A few days ago, I read that J. Patrick Lewis was named the recipient of this year's Award for Excellence in Poetry for Children from the National Council of Teachers of English (this news came via Elaine Magliaro and her informative blog, Wild Rose Reader - Elaine also has a wonderful interview with Pat from 2008.) And a few weeks ago, I got a copy of Pat's book of poetry for adults, Gulls Hold Up the Sky: Poems 1983-2010. Today, I just want to say hooray to Pat, and huge congratulations!
Pat joins poets like Richard Wilbur and X.J. Kennedy who see no problem straddling the fence between the two worlds of writing for children and writing for adults. Talent, a love of language, an observant eye, a sense of humor (which is often a sense of non-sense), and a willingness to work hard. No matter who the audience is, that's what it takes to produce the poetry, and Pat has these qualities.
For Poetry Friday, a silly and wonderful poem from this new book of his (though many are serious, and I thought I should share one of those, no - I can't resist the silly ones):

The lovely people over at Jacket Knack are asking for opinions about Favorite Covers of 2010, and I went a little nuts, suggesting maybe 25-30 of my favorites (on their Facebook page.)

In the last couple of decades a major shift has been happening in transportation. Cars have long been the most likely mode of transport in developed countries, however bikes are beginning to rise in popularity. Perhaps this because the last couple of decades have seen a major shift in the popularity of “living green.” Maybe it is because the cost of gas is just too high. Either way you will now find the roads filled with more cyclists than ever before. Maybe you have considered buying a bike? Here are some hints to help you choose the cycling bicycle that is right for you.
The first thing you should think about, which is pretty obvious, needs to be the cost. Sure you should also consider things like where you will be riding and how often you will be riding, but your other major criteria will almost always be the price of the bicycle.
If you are new to the bike buying business, you will see that the price can be anywhere from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars. The beauty of all this is you can save a ton of money when purchasing your bicycle, if you just know where to look for it. Auctions are one of the best places to find a great bike that will be fairly inexpensive and still have everything you need.
You should always make sure to give the bike a test run before committing to buying it, though. Don't just jump on and jump off though, take a nice little ride for at least a few minutes. Think about it: would you buy a car without taking it for a test drive?
So you should use this same frame of mind when buying your bike. This is especially important if you are going to be view it now spending large sums of money for a bicycle that you are going to be riding a lot. Make sure the bike is perfect for you. Not only should it be the correct size for you, but it should be easily adaptable to your lifestyle, meaning your riding style. You don't want make an investment on a bike that isn't going to feel good to ride.
It is important you allow for room between you and the crossbar. When you choose your bike, adjust the seat up a few inches from the crossbar and then sit on the bike. Your feet should still comfortably rest on the ground. Which bike you get will greatly alter the clearance you will require. If you are buying a touring bike, for example, you only need an inch or so of clearance. With a mountain bike a clearance of 3" will be necessary.
The idea behind buying cycling bicycles is to make sure that you and the bicycle fit well together—physically. When deciding upon using a bike for transportation you need to keep this in mind. Comfort and saftey are the two most important aspects of riding a bike.

Of course the best cure for a hangover , is not to consume more alcohol then your body can digest. Factors that can influence your ability to process alcohol includes body structure, tolerance levels and the type of alcohol consumed. Many people do not realize that the liver can only process one alcoholic beverage per hour . This would mean that ideally your body can process one twelve ounce can of beer, one 6 ounce glass of wine or one shot of hard liquor per hour. However, during the course of a party it is often difficult to keep track of the amount of alcohol consumed. The brain tends to become less inhibited as we consume alcohol and in a social atmosphere it can become easy to have " just one more " if our inhibitions are already lowered. Additionally , fruity mixed drinks can contain several shots of liquor at a time and thus a single drink may contain enough alcohol for three to four hours of safe alcohol consumption . Alternating alcoholic drinks with non alcoholic beverages such as water or seltzer can help reduce some of the effects of alcohol consumption .
Many of the negative effects associated with hangovers can alo be reduced. Headaches which are one of the primary signs of a hangover are often caused by dehydration . This dehydration is a two-tiered side effect. The body works rapidly to excrete alcohol as it is seen as toxic. Water from the cells is used to dilute the alcohol and increase urination so that the "poison" is excreted. Dehydration also occurs during alcohol consumption due to the lack of water intake. The replacement of water with alcoholic beverages decreases the available water for re-hydration thus leading to headaches. Alternating alcoholic beverages with water can help limit this side effect.
By-products of alcoholic fermentation also called congeners, exaggerate many of the hangover symptoms; this probably accounts for the reduction of hangover symptoms when distilled alcohol, particularly vodka, is consumed instead. A 2009 study provided evidence that darker-coloured liquors, such as bourbon, cause worse hangovers than lighter-coloured liquors, such as vodka. The higher amount of congeners found in darker liquors compared to lighter ones was indicated as the cause. A solution to this reaction is to restrict intake of darker liquors.
While there are many precautions that we can take to prevent hangovers, the reality is that many people have to look for a remedy. Water is still a wonderful option and ending the evening with a tall glass of water can be helpful for re-hydrating. Use of ibuprofen based pain relievers rather then acetaminophen based products such as Tylenol is recommended. Acetaminophen is metabolized by the liver and thus avoiding use when the liver is already taxed from detoxifying the body is recommended. Fluids that contain electrolytes should also be encouraged. Electrolytes can be lost due to excess urination or vomiting. Products such as Gatorade may contain large amounts of sugar, so I recommend using an effervescent Vitamin C powder . Products such as Emergen-C contain not only water soluble vitamins that may have been lost but also electrolytes to re-balance the system. Avoid additional alcohol as the "hair of the dog ", will only further exacerbate symptoms. Also avoiding foods with high sodium content is recommended as more water will be leached from the body. As with any medical recommendations, please consult your physician before using any of the above solutions.
In conclusion , moderation or abstinence as prevention is best. I wish you a happy, healthy and safe start to the New Year !

In part one of this series, I introduced the concept of a stack-based language and in particular the syntax and rough ideas behind Cat. However, to anyone coming into concatenative land for the first time, my examples likely seemed both odd and unconvincing. After all, why would you ever use point-free programming when everyone else seems to be sold on the idea of name binding? More importantly, where do these languages fit in with our established menagerie of language paradigms?
The answer to the first question really depends on the situation. I personally think that the best motivation for concatenative languages is their syntax. If you want to create an internal DSL, there will be no language better suited to it than one which is concatenative, Cat, Factor or otherwise. This is because stack-oriented languages can get away with almost no syntax whatsoever. They say that Lisp is a syntax-free language, but this holds even more strongly for languages like Cat. Well, that and you don’t have to deal with all the parentheses…
The second question is (I think) the more interesting one: how do we classify these languages and what sort of methodologies should we apply? At first glance, Cat (and other languages like it) seem to be quite imperative in nature. After all, you have a single mutable stack that any function can modify. However, if you turn your head sideways and blink twice, you begin to realize that concatenative languages are really much closer to the functional side of the oyster.
Trivial, but to the point. This program first adds the numbers 2 and 3, then subtracts the result from 7. Thus, the final result is a value of 2 on the stack. The only twist is that we have defined functions plus and minus to do the dirty work for us. This wasn’t strictly necessary, but I wanted to emphasize that + and - really are functions. We could express the exact same program in Scala:
Do you see how the consecutive invocations of plus and minus in Cat became composed invocations in Scala? This is where the term “concatenative language” derives from: the whole program is just a series of function compositions. Wikipedia’s article on Cat has a very nice, mathematical description:
Two adjacent terms in Cat imply the composition of functions that generate stacks, so the Cat program f g is equivalent to the mathematical expressions and , where x is the stack input to the expression.
Strictly speaking, a concatenative language could be implemented without a stack, but such an implementation would likely be a bit harder to use than the average stack-based language.
Coming back to my original premise: concatenative languages are functional in nature. Absolutely everything in Cat is a function. Operators, words, even numeric literals like “3” are actually functions at the conceptual level. Additionally, Cat, Joy and Factor all offer a mechanism for treating functions as first-class values:
The square-bracket ([]) syntax is representative of a quotation. Literally this mean “create a function of the enclosed words and place it as a value on the stack”. We can pop this function off the stack and invoke it by using the apply word. Incidentally, you may have noticed that this syntax is remarkably close to that which is used in if conditionals:
This syntax works because if isn’t conceptually a language primitive: it’s just another function which happens to take a boolean and two quotations off the stack. For the sake of efficiency, Cat does indeed implement if as a primitive, but this was a deliberate optimization rather than an implementation forced by the language design. Untyped Cat (see Part 3) is equivalent in power to the pure-untyped lambda calculus, and as our friend Alonzo Church showed us, if-style conditionals are easily accomplished:
So if Cat is just another functional programming language, then we should be able to implement all of those higher-order design patterns that we’ve come to know and love in languages like Scala and ML. To see how, let’s look at implementing some simple list manipulation functions in Cat. The easiest would be to start with append, which pops two lists off of the stack and pushes a new list which is the end-to-end concatenation of the two originals:
This function first starts by checking to see if the top list is empty. If so, then just pop it off the stack and leave the other right where it is. Appending an empty list should always yield the original list. However, if the head list is not empty, then we need to work a bit. First, we decompose it into its tail and head, which are pushed onto the stack in order by the uncons function. Next, we need to recursively append the tail with our second list on the stack. However, the head of the list from uncons is in the way on top of the stack. We could use stack manipulation to move things around and get our lists up to the head of the stack, but dip provides us with a handy, higher-order shortcut. We temporarily remove the top of the stack, invoke the quotation “[append]” against the remainder and then push the old top back on top of the result.
The dip operation is surprisingly powerful, making it possible to completely live without either variables or multiple stacks. Any non-trivial Cat program will need to make use of this handy function at some level.
Once we have the old head and the new appended-list on the stack, all we need to do is put them back together using cons. This function leaves a new list on the stack in place of the old list and head element. This Cat program is almost precisely analogous to the following ML:
Personally, I find the ML a lot easier to read, but that’s just me. Obviously it’s a lot shorter, but as it turns out, our Cat implementation, while intuitive, was sub-optimal. Cat already implements append in the guise of the cat function, and it is far more concise than what I showed:
It’s almost frightening how short this is: only three words. It’s not as if rfold is doing anything mysterious either; it’s just a simple right-fold function that takes a list, an initial value and a quotation, producing a result by traversing the entire list. We can use something similar back in ML-land, achieving an implementation which is arguably equivalent in subjective elegance:
Moving on, we can also implement a length function in Cat, this time using fold to tighten things up:
You’ll notice that we have to mess around a bit in the quotation in order to avoid the first “parameter”, the current element of the list (which we do not need). Expressing this in ML yields a very similar degree of cruft:
The important take-away from this tangled morass of an article is the fact that Cat is a highly functional language, capable of easily keeping up with some of the stalwart champions of the paradigm. More significantly, this is a trait which is shared by all concatenative languages. Rather than throwing away all of the old wisdom learned in language design, stack-based languages build on it by providing an alternative view into the world of functions.
In the next (and final) article of the series, we will take a brief look at the challenges of applying a type system to a concatenative language and the fascinating techniques used by Cat to achieve just that.
I have a brief question about the ‘dip’ operator. Where is the element that is popped off placed? It seems to me that this is a secondary stack, in fact, the ‘usual’ stack which one might find in functional programs, while the actual ’stack’ used by Cat is more like a big input argument that is threaded along. (Sort of like the ‘World’ in the IO monad of Haskell, or a list in a state-monad).
Wow! About eight years ago, I invented a concatenative stack-based language when I was playing with genetic programming. It worked really well. It’s easy to cross over two streams of symbols. I just didn’t know there were real languages out there like mine.
Christophe Poucet: usually the dip operator is implemented by placing the element on a hidden extra stack. So [ ... ] dip in Cat/Joy/Factor is analogous to >r … r> in Forth, except there’s no way to mess up and write code with unbalanced >r/r>’s.
codist: Cat has a type system, first-class functions and automatic memory management. Forth does not.
kib2, Rebol is a cool language; it’s not a coincidence that its author has a lot of experience with Forth. Its DSL capabilities lie in two main areas: first, its syntax is simple enough to be generally useful for many domains; and second, it comes with a simple LL parser that’s well-integrated. Factor excels over Rebol in both of these ways — it has a PEG parser (which is far more powerful than Rebol’s LL parser), and its syntax is strictly left-to-right (as opposed to Rebol’s left to right reading with right-to-left execution).
Still, Rebol is a good language. I hope its new version does well; I’ve been watching it hoping for some results for quite some time.
I admit that I find the concept of the ’stack’ in stack languages then rather ambiguously phrased. To me it just seems -a- datastructure that is threaded along that just happens to be a stack. But it appears that the true call stack is that hidden stack you refer to. Is this correct?
Christophe, the “stack” in stack languages is the means for communicating between function invocations. Some stack languages, like Forth, actually have two stacks, with the second one serving as the return stack and a temporary data storage space; but only one is absolutely needed. There’s an experimental concatenative language named “xy” which uses a queue, and it’s possible to code a “stackless” call structure so that a call stack isn’t used (although I don’t know whether anyone’s done that yet for a concatenative language).
I already tried Factor wich seems a very interesting language, but the main problem is actually the total lack of documentation. Sure, there’s a “Your first program” section and then the “index”, but how can learn a programming language from an index (particularly when it is a stack based one)? Not me. I already told Slava about this fact on IRC, and I can understand he’s busy developping Factor; but one must admit that a language without docs is just useless. Some efforts have been done by Aaron Schaefer recently by writting some blog posts about Factor, and they’re really great. Here too, I’m looking forward for his third part.
kib2, there is a lot of documentation in Factor. Look at http://docs.factorcode.org or use the browser in the Factor UI, you will find that the entire core language and most of the libraries are extensively documented. For introductory material, there is a tutorial as well as a cookbook.
The concatenative language’s concept of a “stack” actually is a very precise, mathematically defined construct: a last in, first out stack.
The dip operator is 100% compatible with this definition. It pops the top of the stack, applies the quotation to the resulting stack, then pushes the original item back onto the stack. At NO TIME does the dip operator violate the semantics of the mathematical concept of a stack.
In the real-world, of course, our computers do not run on stack architectures; therefore, it might store the top of stack in another CPU register. Or, it might be pushed onto the hardware call stack, as in Forth with >R and R>. Or, who knows, it might be stored in a well-known, reserved memory location (a la 6502’s zero-page locations). This is an implementation detail that you needn’t concern yourself with.
(Here let’s assume the definitions of plus and minus have been changed so that they apply only to the last two items in the list.)
No. His equivalence is correct. Your equivalence would be 7 2 3 + + – which would produce a stack underflow.

On Wednesday, June 28th, the Seattle news outlet The Stranger published an article called The Detransitioners: They Were Transgender, Until They Weren't. Amongst its numerous flaws, it gave credence to the notion that there is a “social contagion” to become transgender, and that this is a cause behind why some people eventually decide to detransition.
Back in 2016, I detailed both the biased thinking behind, and the potential harm caused by, this notion, in my lengthy and nuanced essay Detransition, Desistance, and Disinformation: A Guide for Understanding Transgender Children Debates (and in this follow up). Herzog reached out to interview me for her The Stranger article, saying she had read my essay. I was open to it at first, until it became clear to me that she was planning to legitimize that “social contagion” theory in her piece. When Herzog's article came out last week, I penned a blogpost called Stop pitting detransitioners against happily transitioned people, in which I pointed out the skewed framing and several (albeit not all) of the misconceptions that Herzog's article forwarded.
On Friday, June 30th, an editor from The Stranger contacted me and said that they were interested in re-publishing my blogpost. By this point, there had been significant backlash to Herzog’s article from trans communities due to the piece’s skewed framing. These days, when people hear the phrase “backlash,” they immediately conjure up images of “internet trolls” and “snowflakes” and “sensitive millennials” who get upset about the slightest misplaced word, and who want to complain about anything and everything. So to be clear, the backlash in this case came from a marginalized community (i.e., trans people) who have a set of experiences in the world that allow them to see shortcomings and biases in Herzog’s article that other people may not readily perceive. And trans communities are highly aware of how notions of “social contagion,” “trendsgender,” and “cisgender people being turned transgender because of peer pressure” are routinely used by those who wish to rollback transgender rights and access to healthcare.
Anyway, The Stranger editor thanked me for my blogpost and asked if they could re-publish it. The way they reached out to me seemed to indicate that they realized (in retrospect) the faults with Herzog’s article and wanted to offer their readers a counter point of view. Over the weekend, we (the editor and I) worked out the logistics, and I was told my piece would likely be published on their website on Monday (July 3rd).
Then on that Monday, I received an email from the editor mentioning that they would be running my piece first, followed by Katie Herzog’s response to the reactions she received to her article (including her response to my blogpost). This was the first that I had heard of any of this, and frankly I felt a bit blindsided by this news. I was led to believe that they wanted to publish my blogpost in recognition of the flaws in Herzog’s article, but now it seemed like they might just be setting my piece up for Herzog to knock it back down.
When I expressed my reservations about this arrangement, the editor said that instead Herzog’s piece would come out first, after which point I could decide whether to allow them the right to re-publish my blogpost.
Late on Monday, Herzog’s piece came out. It was most certainly not a thoughtful response from someone who was open to listening to marginalized voices and willing to admit to the shortcomings of their piece. On the contrary, it was an extremely vindictive retort, most of it focused on personally undermining Danni Askini and Ijeoma Oluo, two activists/writers/people who I greatly respect. Herzog is obviously free to say what she wants about other people, but I question The Stranger’s decision to allow their large news/media platform to be used to trash individuals who pen Facebook posts that critique their articles and publishing decisions.
At one point, Herzog mocks Oluo’s claim that she cited a “discredited” doctor in her article, and presumes that Oluo was referring to James Cantor (although it could just as easily have been Ray Blanchard, who Herzog also quotes); then Herzog gives Cantor several paragraphs to reply to this charge. What Herzog doesn’t mention is that both Cantor and Blanchard are considered (by both trans people and most trans health professionals) to represent the far pathologizing/conservative wing of thought on these matters. Herzog does not provide this context in her article, which contributes to the overall skewed framing. I believe that Oluo and others have every right to critique Herzog for such decisions.
Herzog’s response to my post is short—it does not at all address any of the substantive points that I make in my piece. Instead, she simply tries to dismiss me for not quoting people who detransitioned in my pieces. Of course, I don’t quote happily transitioned people, or trans health professionals, or parents of trans kids either, for the simple reason that I am an essayist, not a journalist. But I have read/listened/talked to all of these parties at length over the years, including people who have detransitioned. I personally know people who have detransitioned, and have also received emails from people who have detransitioned thanking me for my writings. Not a single one of these individuals expressed feeling pressured into becoming trans—on the contrary, most state that they detrainsitioned because of family or social pressure to *not* be trans (and some of these individuals later re-transitioned). Others detransitioned for personal reasons (e.g., shifts in identity, the changes didn’t suit them), but do not feel aggrieved by the trans healthcare system (and often keep a low profile because they do not want their stories to be misused by those who wish to rollback trans rights/healthcare). I have never once, in any of my writings, claimed or insinuated that these are the only detransition experiences and perspectives that matter. Rather, I have simply pointed out that the recurring exclusion of such voices from sensationalistic “detransitioner” articles like Herzog’s paints a distorted picture for trans-unaware readers.
As I said, Herzog is free to write whatever she wants. But I am disappointed that The Stranger—who initially seemed to want to republish my piece in recognition of the flaws and skewed framing of Herzog’s article—decided instead to double-down on it, while trashing two activists/writers in the process. As much as I would like my piece to reach a wider audience, I do not feel that The Stranger is genuine in its desire to address the numerous problems with the article they published, nor do I believe that they are taking transgender communities’ concerns about the article seriously. For this reason, I will not be allowing them to republish my piece.

The Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime And NHS England (London Region) were awarded up to £554,500 to contribute to our London Child House pilot. This will improve support for children and young people who have been sexually abused or exploited by bringing services together under one roof; a “child house”.
MOPAC and NHS England (London Region) are leading the development of a pilot ‘Child House’ in London. The service will provide support to children and young people who have been a victim of child sexual abuse and child sexual exploitation as well their non-offending families and carers. The Child House will be based on a model of international best practice, bringing together medical, investigative and therapeutic services ‘under one roof’, alongside support for child victims to progress more rapidly through the criminal justice and court process.
Improved professionals awareness, competence and confidence in working with Child Sexual Abuse/Child Sexual Exploitation;
Increased likelihood for children and young people who received a Child House service to have cases charged by the Crown Prosecution Service;
Increased likelihood for children and young people who received a Child House service to have their case end in conviction; and
This service will be the first of its kind in the UK and will be based in Camden, supporting children and young people across the North Central sector of London. It is expected that the Child House will support approximately 700 children and young people in North Central London per year.
Funding from the Department for Education Social Care Innovation Fund is specifically being used to:
Create a plan to ensure the multiplicity of interagency links and funding arrangements are manageable and sustainable going forward; and

Growers are the first link in the sustainable chain. We support them with targeted advice about the use of staff, food safety, the use of natural resources, CO2 reductions and profitability.
Our growers often work with immigrant seasonal workers. They offer them support in every respect (welcome, administration, etc.). This increases the involvement with the company. Growers also pay considerable attention to the training of their staff: first-aid, Dutch on the shop floor, illness, etc.
All members make an effort to reduce their ecological footprint with full conviction. They do this with innovative systems such as heat pumps, energy screens, solar boilers, etc. But a good dose of common sense will also get you a long way: our growers make grateful use of rainwater that is collected in silos and reservoirs.
Hoogstraten received the Responsibly Fresh sustainability quality label. Watertight proof of our growers' excellent work. Because every product that bears the quality label comes from growers who have chosen for:
Hi there & welcome to Annie's Place. A place inspired by and named after my late Grandmother Annie. Somewhere I can be creative, and share my love for all things handmade. I like nothing better than sitting with hook & yarn, crafting something home spun & completely unique, or rustling up some yummy baked goodies. I live in a town with a beautiful embankment, situated on the River Great Ouse. You may know me as CosyKitty on Ravelry. Why not stop a while.....?!!
Hi folks, Monday again *yawn*. I'm so so pleased you all seem to like the progress I'm making on the This 'n' That blanket. It really is a joy to work on, so thank you for the lovely comments, it's been great to hear from you x x x x
Now; where did the weekend go? I think I missed it! Maybe that's because I was immersed in a little cutesy craft project I spontaneously decided to have a go at.
I was having a good old nose around on pinterest, ooohing and aaahing at all the wonderful hand made goodies. I get such itchy fingers looking at all the fantastic crafty ideas floating about on the web. I just want to jump right in and have a go at EVERYTHING! Alas, I have not the time nor the skill to do that. However, I did take the opportunity to try something quick and easy to satisfy my crafty urges.
You may remember my very first project of the year, where I recycled some old store cupboard jars into yarn covered tea light holders. Well, as I've accumulated so many empty jars this past couple of months I thought I'd do something in a similar vein, but this time using crochet. So I grabbed some of my organic cotton and started to improvise, making wee jackets for my empty jars.
I started by making a chain long enough to wrap comfortably around the jar, (it was around 40 for these small Dolmio sauce jars) securing it with a slip stitch at the end, then crocheted row upon row of lovely half treble (UK) stitches, round and around, till I reached the required size. I was finished in no time. I then set about tidying up the couple of loose ends, before moving on to the embellishments. A button, a bit of ribbon, and some twine were all I needed to give them my own unique stamp.
Smaller jars make perfect tea light holders, but larger jars would be great as storage for all your knitting needles and crochet hooks. I know a lot of you will have tried this already, but if you haven't why not give it a go!
The half treble stitch looks lovely, I love the texture it gives with the yarn you've used. Great idea xx
Such a simple idea but so effective, they are beautiful. Something else to go on my long list of things to copy. Sue x
I've just peeked at your first project as well - how clever! I can imagine lovely groups of these with pretty things in. Well done x Jane
Yes, very cute idea indeed!! Well done. They would look beautiful lined up on a mantle, candles aglow, in the colors of whatever holiday it happens to be!!
What a clever idea! I always save glass jars without any real reason or purpose. Now I know what I can do with them! Thank you for sharing.
I absolutely love your blog. All I your beautiful afghans, how lovely. I recently started my blog and I would like to invite you to join. Kathy
Lovely embellishment of an every day item! I love how they glow with the candles and cast the pattern's shadow :-) Thank you for the inspiration!
I love the added details of the bow, the cute button and the pretty ribbon. I like it when simple things are so effective! Well designed and they look so pretty in a row!
I am amazed by the very pretty texture a simple half treble stitch makes, I will definitely give it a go! :-) xxxx
I love your little tea light jars; having seen various colours, stitches, and styles of jar covers on other sites - which I have liked also - I look at yours and appreciate a sedate classiness which will allow the little lights to create their own glow without having to compete with bright colours! A lovely job well done Sharon, and thanks for inspiring me once again. X
I really like what you have done with the jars! I really enjoy reading all your posts, therefore I've nominatd you for a Liebster Blog Award. I hope you don't mind. More details you can find on my blog. Liefs Else X
These are great Such a simple and sweet idea but they look fabulous with the candles burning away inside. I'm going to find me some jars so I can have a go myself :)
I just discovered your blog site and love it. I never knew my grandparents but I love vintage, old fashion things. I just love these jars. I love glass so much more than plastic so I will be making these. I covered some glass IBC soda bottles once. It will be worth taking the time to convert your patterns to US. Thank you for sharing your beautiful projects and the patterns.

A painting of this image appears in the background of Jan/Van Balen's Allegory of Winter (Ertz 2008-10 #531); Ertz thinks this indicates that there was once a painting of the subject but that is not the case at all -- images were clearly transformed in scale and, no doubt, medium, when being fit into another picture.
There are several painted copies of this work, some of which Ertz has attributed to Jan the Younger. One sold Brussels, Pal. des Beaux-Arts Mar.9, 1953 #15 (panel, 53 x 44); another sold Amsterdam, F. Muller, 15 November 1938 #17 (panel, 59 x 46); page on wiki for second of these. Photographs at RKD represent this second work before and after restoration.
Whether you are buying or selling a home, it can be quite the adventure. In this world of instant gratification and internet searches, many sellers think that they can ‘For Sale by Owner’ or ‘FSBO,’ but it’s not as easy as it may seem. That’s why you need an experienced real estate professional to guide you on the path to achieving your ultimate goal!
The 5 reasons you need a real estate professional in your corner haven’t changed but have rather been strengthened by the projections of higher mortgage interest rates and home prices as the market continues to pick up steam.
Each state has different regulations regarding the contracts required for a successful sale, and these regulations are constantly changing. A true real estate professional is an expert in his or her market and can guide you through the stacks of paperwork necessary to make your dream a reality.
There are over 230 possible steps that need to take place during every successful real estate transaction. Don’t you want someone who has been there before, someone who knows what these actions are, to ensure you achieve your dream?
So maybe you’re not convinced that you need an agent to sell your home. After looking at the list of parties that you will need to be prepared to negotiate with, you’ll soon realize the value in selecting a real estate professional. From the buyers (who want the best deals possible), to the home inspection companies, all the way to the appraisers, there are at least 11 different people who you will need to be knowledgeable of, and answer to, during the process.
It is important for your home to be priced correctly from the start in order to attract the right buyers and shorten the amount of time that it’s on the market. You need someone who is not emotionally connected to your home to give you its true value. According to a recent article by the National Association of Realtors, FSBOs achieve prices significantly lower than the prices of similar properties sold by real estate agents:
“FSBOs earn an average of $60,000 to $90,000 less on the sale of their home than sellers who work with a real estate agent.”
There is so much information out there on the news and on the internet about home sales, prices, and mortgage rates; how do you know what’s going on specifically in your area? Who do you turn to in order to competitively and correctly price your home at the beginning of the selling process? How do you know what to offer on your dream home without paying too much, or offending the seller with a lowball offer?
“When getting help with money, whether it’s insurance, real estate or investments, you should always look for someone with the heart of a teacher, not the heart of a salesman.”
Hiring an agent who has his or her finger on the pulse of the market will make your buying or selling experience an educated one. You need someone who is going to tell you the truth, not just what they think you want to hear.
You wouldn’t replace the engine in your car without a trusted mechanic, so why would you make one of the most important financial decisions of your life without hiring a real estate professional?

NEW DELHI: Leading brands of some of the drugs used for treatment of cardiac diseases and diabetes are up to 10 times higher than generic medicines, government said today.
"Yes, it is a fact that some branded medicines are many times costlier than generic medicines," Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilisers Mansukh L Mandaviya said in a reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha.
The average price of leading brands of cardiac treatment drugs such as Amlodipine 5 mg and Atenolol 50 mg film coated tablets, Ramipril 5 mg tablets and Losartan 50 mg and Hydroclorothiaze 12.5 mg tablets is 10-8 times costlier than the generic medicines in Jan Aushadhi Kendras, he added.
In the diabetes drugs segment the average price of leading brands of some medicines is also higher between 10-3 times the MRP of generic drugs in Jan Aushadhi Kendras, Mandaviya said.
While leading brands of Glimepiride 2 mg tablets are available for Rs 50 for a 10 tablets pack size, the generic medicine is available at Rs 5.05 in the Jan Aushadhi Kendras, he added.
On the other hand, Metformin HCL 500 mg tablets leading brands are 3 times higher than the generic medicines in the Jan Aushadhi Kendras, Mandaviya said.
In the antibiotic segment also the leading brands of some of the medicines are higher up to 4 times, he added.
The leading brands of Ofloxacin 200 mg tablets are priced at Rs 52.60 for a 10 tablets pack while the generic medicines are available at Rs 14.80 in Jan Aushadhi Kendras, Mandaviya said.

The surgical procedure to treat problems associated with a crooked or deviated nose, such as chronic sinusitis, inflammation, bleeding, or sleep apnea, is termed septoplasty.
Septoplasty, submucous resection of the septum, or septal reconstruction is a corrective surgery to straighten or repair a deviated nasal septum – the wall between the two nasal passages. Usually the septum is straight and upright, and runs down the center of the nose. A deviated septum occurs when the cartilage or bone of the septum is not straight, thereby narrowing the cavity into which is deviates making breathing difficult. This condition can lead to snoring and sleep apnea, and in certain serious deviations may frequently lead to chronic sinus problems.
Septoplasty is necessary only when the problems associated with crooked nasal septum do not get better without surgery. The surgery may be done along with other procedures to treat chronic sinusitis, inflammation, or bleeding, or to correct sleep apnea. The procedure also may be done to allow access into the nose to remove nasal polyps.
The procedure usually involves an excision or cutting of a portion of the cartilage and/or bone surplus. Under general or local anesthesia, the surgeon works through the nostrils, making an incision in the lining of the septum to reach the cartilage targeted in the operation. Often an “L” strut of cartilage in the dorsal and caudal areas (1cm width or more) is preserved for structural support. After excess cartilage and bone have been taken out, the septum may then be stabilized with small plastic tubes, splints, or sutures. The operation takes about 60-90 minutes.
Considerable swelling and bruising can be expected. The nasal cavities may or may not be packed, and a piece of gauze is taped underneath the nose to absorb blood. Postoperative care includes frequent changing of this gauze (roughly every hour or so) and after 1 to 2 days, the excess bleeding normally stops and the inner nasal packing may be removed. The following day, saline irrigations of the nasal cavities are often advised, and the patient may be allowed to gently blow their nose. After 1 to 2 weeks, patients are allowed to blow their nose normally. Patients typically regain about 80% of their energy one week after the surgery.

Surgery isn’t the first or even the last thing that comes to mind when you think tourism and vice versa. As misnomered as it may sound, but surgical tourism is what is happening in the health care industry today. Surgical tourism, also known as medical tourism, medical travel, health travel and health tourism , is traveling abroad for surgery.
The number one reason is because they can get huge discounts when compared to the price tags on surgeries at home. Surgical tourists claim to have saved from 50% to over 90%. Another reason revolves around the long wait-lists in countries like Canada and UK with public health care system. Some go for elective surgeries not covered by insurance.
Check out pictures of some of the international hospitals catering to foreign patients at https://www.healthbase.com/hb/pages/hospitals_pl.jsp and you will notice how immaculate their 5-star hotel type facilities are. Their accreditations include those like JCI, JCAHO and ISO. Patients vouch for the personalized service they get. It’s not uncommon to see world-renowned surgeons at these international hospitals playing finger-magic behind the latest billion-dollar robotic machines.
Well, that’s because in some countries like India, Thailand, Singapore, Turkey, Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama and others, the cost of labor when compared to the US, UK or Canada is lower. Plus, administrative costs and malpractice costs are also lower. These are the countries that are hot surgical tourism destinations.
Range from breast augmentation to Birmingham hip resurfacing surgery , and from lap band to triple cardiac bypass surgery. And it’s not just surgeries that people seek. Some go for therapeutic treatments and others for cancer treatments. Restorative and reparative treatments like LASIK are common and so are preventive check-ups and simple dental fix-ups .
While the primary motivation for most surgical tourists is affordable surgery, the opportunity to visit exotic destinations is an additional draw for some. You can plan to have a holiday during your visit to the foreign country before the surgery if your health permits or after the surgery if your surgeon permits.
Getting surgery overseas is not even closely related to getting surgery at your local hospital but it can save you a ton of money. However, it involves careful research and planning. Begin by collecting more information about the trend of surgical tourism. You may start here: http://www.healthbase.com/resources/medical-tourism/medical-tourism-information . Read what others are saying about it. Educate yourself about the surgery desired. Do your due diligence in researching the various international hospitals and surgeons at the surgical destination you are interested in. Compare quotes from various providers and finalize one.

Some people have gastric bypass surgery and shed 100 pounds or more. What can this surgery do for you?
To answer this question, you will first need to know what gastric bypass surgery is and how it helps you lose weight.
A gastric bypass surgery also known as Roux en-Y surgery is a medical procedure that reduces the size of your stomach causing you to feel full when you have eaten only a small portion. What your surgeon will essentially do is divide your stomach into two sections – a small upper one and a much larger remnant one using surgical staples (which is why this procedure is also known as stomach stapling). The small top pouch is the one that will hold your food. Your surgeon will also re-arrange your small intestine such that both the stomach pouches remain connected to the intestines.
The reduction in the functional volume of your stomach reduces your food intake. Not only that, the re-arrangement of the small intestine causes food to by-pass the first part of the small intestine resulting in reduced calorie absorption. Both these factors help you lose weight.
That’s a personal choice or your doctor may prescribe it for you. Generally, it is considered in only those individuals who have tried hard but failed to achieve weight loss through exercise and diet.
Obesity, which is a complex disease, leads to other diseases. Morbid obesity or the accumulation of too much body fat increases a person’s risk for developing other health problems or co-morbidities such as heart diseases, diabetes, etc.
That’s calculated by your body mass index or BMI which is a measure of your weight in relation to your height. In simple words, it tells you how much you should normally weigh for your height and if you exceed that normal weight then you are medically considered overweight. Reducing your weight and therefore, your BMI, helps you control the risk of developing obesity related health problems. (Use the BMI calculator to calculate your BMI.)
Like any other surgery there are risks associated with gastric bypass surgery as well. Some of the risks include gastritis (which is an inflammation of the stomach lining), development of gallstones (caused by significant weight loss in a short time), nausea, vomiting, bleeding, infections, and nutritional deficiency (which can be avoided through nutritional supplements). So, when deciding to have the surgery you should carefully weigh the risks associated with it and the problems that it can solve for you.
Variations of gastric bypass surgery are gastric bypass, Roux en-Y proximal; gastric bypass, Roux en-Y distal; and loop gastric bypass or mini-gastric bypass. Gastric bypass surgery is not the only bariatric surgery available for treating morbid obesity. Some people also consider gastric lap-band as an option.
The cost can be a major deciding factor when considering the surgery. Depending upon your specific medical conditions and insurance terms, your health insurance carrier may or may not cover the costs.
The high cost of healthcare has led some Americans to seek treatment in countries like India, Thailand, Singapore, Mexico and Turkey. This practice of going abroad, which is termed as medical tourism or medical travel or health tourism, is a way of getting low cost high quality medical care. But before you decide to outsource your health care it’s extremely important that you do your homework properly – research the facilities, the surgeons, compare the cost and quality offered by different hospitals, talk to people who have had their surgery overseas, etc.

BMI is often times used to determine whether or not a person is obese. As BMI increases, the risk of some diseases increases. A BMI of 30 or above is considered obese in adults, which means a person is at a higher risk for certain diseases, including heart disease, high blood pressure, and coronary artery disease (CAD).
The following table provides information about the extent of the risk factors that may be associated with your calculated BMI. However, it should be noted that BMI is only one of many factors used to predict the risk of developing a disease.
Medical tourism is an affordable option to seek surgery to treat obesity. For more information about medical tourism and to get your free quote log on to Healthbase.

Laminectomy is a surgical procedure for treating spinal stenosis by relieving pressure on the spinal cord. The spinal cord is made up of vertebrae. Laminectomy is performed to remove the part of the vertebra called the lamina. The removal or trimming of the vertebra widens the spinal canal to create more space for the spinal nerves thereby taking pressure off the nerves in either the back or the neck.
One of the most common reasons for laminectomy is a prolapsed or herniated intervertebral disc. If the herniated disc is in the lumbar region, this can cause sharp and continuing back pain, a weakening of the muscles in the leg, and some loss of sensation in the leg and foot. It may also be difficult to raise the leg when it is held in a straight position. A herniated disc in the neck region can cause symptoms including pain, numbness and weakness in the arm. A herniated disc may be triggered by, for example, twisting the back while lifting something heavy. The surgeon will attempt to relieve the pressure on nerves and nerve roots by removing the pulpy material that is protruding from the disc.
Laminectomies are named depending upon the vertebrae involved. When the procedure is performed on the neck it is called cervical laminectomy as the cervical vertebrae are involved. Cervical laminectomy is most often performed for a trapped nerve (as may happen for example, in arthritis of the neck).
When it is performed on the lower back affecting the lumbar vertebrae, it is called a lumbar laminectomy. This procedure is often performed for disk protrusions, which may occur after a major accident but also sometimes occur after a quite minor twisting injury of the lower back.
The patient will have nothing to eat or drink for 6 to 10 hours prior to surgery and an enema will be given to empty the bowel. A pre-medication injection is usually given to promote drowsiness and to dry up some internal secretions. If you take a daily medication, ask if you should still take it the morning of surgery.
A number of tests are performed before the operation, which include blood tests, urine analysis and sometimes an electrical recording of the heart (electrocardiogram, ECG) and a chest X-ray.
Your surgeon should explain to you the nature of your operation, the reasons for it, the outcome and the possible risks involved. They should be able to tell you the approximate length of stay in hospital that will be required and the number of weeks you will need to recuperate before returning to work. Your anaesthetist will visit you to see how suitable you are for surgery.
On the day of the surgery, your temperature, pulse, breathing, and blood pressure will be checked. An IV (intravenous) line may be started to provide fluids and medications needed during surgery.
Laminectomy is usually performed under general anesthesia so you are fully asleep during the operation.
The patient is placed face-down on the operating table. The exact procedure depends on the location of the herniated disc; example, if the disc is located in the neck, the head is clamped to prevent movement. The skin is marked for incision.
During a laminectomy, the lamina (bone that forms the back of the spinal canal) is removed from the affected vertebra. If the operation is performed on the neck (a cervical laminectomy), it is usually performed through a vertical cut, three or four inches long, along the middle of the neck at the back. The surgeon exposes the bones of the neck beneath the skin and a small amount of bone is clipped away, which relieves the pressure on the nerves. Once the nerve is free of pressure, the incision is closed with stitches or surgical staples. An adhesive dressing is applied over the wound. Sometimes, a plastic drain is left in the wound for a few days after the operation to drain any blood that may have collected under the wound.
After surgery, you’ll be sent to the PACU (post-anesthesia care unit). When you are fully awake, you’ll be moved to your room. The nurses will give you medications to ease the pain and stiffness in your neck or back. You may have a catheter (small tube) in your bladder. You’ll also be shown how to keep your lungs clear.
Usually, after cervical laminectomy you are nursed up-right in bed for the first day and not allowed to lie flat to prevent excessive build-up of fluid under the wound. If a drain has been inserted into the wound, this is usually removed after two days. You may be allowed out of bed one or two days after a cervical laminectomy. The period of bed rest may be a few days longer for a lumbar laminectomy.
The average length of stay in hospital is two to three days, but this can vary somewhat, according to whether your operation was on the neck or back and on the size and exact nature of the operation performed.
While in the hospital, the patient is taught the proper method of rolling the body in order to maintain proper body alignment. This is most important for the first 48 hours or so. A physiotherapist gives specific instructions on how to get out of bed properly in order to avoid stress and strain on the wound site.
The patient is encouraged to walk, stand and sit for short periods. The patient is taught how to prevent twisting, flexing or hyperextending the back while moving around. Patient is later treated with ultrasound therapy to rehabilitate from this surgery.
Most people need to be off work for between one and three weeks after leaving hospital, depending on the nature of their work. Work that is physically demanding or that involves lifting heavy objects may require a longer time off.
If the operation was performed on your neck, you will need to wear a cervical collar for about six weeks.
Avoid activities that strain the spine – such as sitting or standing for too long, flexing your spine, bending at the waist, climbing too many stairs or going for long trips in the car.
After two weeks at home, try to have a 10 minute walk each day, unless advised otherwise by your doctor.
Report to your doctor any signs of infection, such as wound redness or drainage, elevated body temperature or persistent headaches.
The cost of laminectomy surgery varies from surgeon to surgeon and hospital to hospital. The price may go up to tens of thousands of dollars and your insurance may or may not cover the costs.

This is the first and most important presupposition. Tragically, even among most Christians, including evangelical and other theologically conservative/traditional/orthodox Christians, this fact that is not only clearly, repeatedly set forth in the Bible but is also obvious due to logic and common sense is oft rejected. The issue is not that most people who acknowledge the existence of God in some sense deny His sovereignty. Instead, the real problem is that most people who claim to believe in the sovereignty of God really do not. As a result, they fail to accurately convey the meaning and implications of God’s total, utter sovereignty over creation to the larger culture.
Make no mistake: there is only one God. God has no equal and no rival. God fears no one, answers to no one, and judges no one. There is no other entity – or group of entities – capable of judging God with unrighteousness. Even if they attempted, it would be utter madness of the highest degree, because there is no way to enforce the verdict. God not only created all things that exist, but all things that exist are sustained by God’s power! These facts give God not only the might but also the right to behave towards His creation however He chooses. Now God does choose to behave towards His creation in a fair, just and loving way. He does so in order to be consistent with His own nature. Indeed, God is incapable of acting any other way … He is incapable of acting in an unjust, cruel, irrational or arbitrary manner. But being the self-existing deity who solely created and solely owns all else that ever was, is or shall be, fairness, justice, love, order, rationality etc. are all defined by God Himself. There is a proverb popularized by William Shakespeare: “to thine own self be true.” Well, God is the only entity for whom this proverb can possibly apply, for everything else that exists has a Maker, Ruler and Judge. God is in debt to no one. He exists in fear of no one. God is only responsible for answering to Himself. Man’s only option is to accept this fact. The refusal or inability to do so can only at best be called a self-delusion of the highest order. One certainly has the prerogative to claim all he pleases that because he does not like the facts of life that he rejects either the existence of God or of a final judgment by God, but it is sheer madness for this person to actually believe that his mere opinion actually has some bearing – some influence – over whether there actually is a God, there will actually be a judgment day, and the Bible is actually true or not. Since we are but creatures, we have no more say in or power over these matters than we did in our own creation!
So even if God did strike Japan and cause all of the carnage, destruction and loss of life, it was well within His prerogative to do so, because God created Japan, God sustains Japan, God owns Japan, and therefore Japan and all the people therein are the exclusive domain of God to do with as He pleases whenever He pleases. Even according to human logic with the things that we “create” or “buy” (it is mine; I can do with it whatever I want!) this is truth, and our failure to acknowledge this is merely evidence of just how narcissistic we are. It is reminiscent of how Satan demanded that Jesus Christ, the very One who not only created Satan but sustains Satan’s existence, demanded that Jesus Christ bow down and worship HIM! Obviously, Satan was no threat to Jesus Christ in any way, because all Jesus Christ has to do to remove even a theoretical threat is to stop sustaining the existence of said threat!
Satan’s lack of reason and rationality due to the madness caused by his fallen condition caused him to be so presumptuous as to ask a thing of the one responsible for his own original and continued existence, and it is the same madness that causes humans to deny that God has no less than the same absolute dominion over us than we have over some plastic toy that we buy from a discount store. This exists only because we believe that our own relative worth in comparison to God’s worth is so much greater than the relative worth of that cheap plastic toy as compared to us. This is total folly and an utter offense, and is so because we both greatly diminish God’s importance while inflating our own. This is nothing but the sin of pride, the sin of vanity, the very same which caused Satan’s fall from his own exalted position to begin with.
You might make a mental assent to the first point and say “OK, God is great, but that does not make Him good, and as a moral agent I am well within my rights to dispute God’s goodness if He is responsible for the deaths of so many good and innocent people, including babies.” Now while from a cosmic level this argument is still useless (you can call God unjust all you want and you still can’t make Him listen), it must be acknowledged that this argument can be used to challenge the authority of the Bible. For instance, if the Bible declares God to be just, and it can be shown that God is not just, then rather than necessarily being an indictment on God, it is instead an indictment on the Bible that Christians claim is God’s authoritative and inerrant self-revelation to man. So, convicting God as unrighteous is more useful as an argument for, say, deism, than for actually putting God on trial.
The problem is that the Bible definitively removes this argument with its doctrines of original sin and federal headship. When Adam sinned, the effects were not limited to Adam himself. No, God made Adam the representative of the human race and the steward of creation. So, the result of Adam’s misdeed was the fall of the entire human race and all of creation. God did not create evil. When God finished creation, it was, according to the declaration of a just, holy and righteous God, “very good”, which means that there was no evil in it (for God cannot and will not declare anything that has evil present in it “very good”). When Adam sinned, not just Adam but all of creation was no longer “very good.” This means that all of creation was no longer acceptable in God’s sight. All of creation no longer met God’s standard, which is total holiness; complete sinlessness; absolute perfection; peerless harmony with God and His nature. “In Adam all die” indeed!
Now with creation no longer meeting God’s standard, God was well within His right to destroy it all. Not just destroy Adam. Not just destroy the human race. Not just destroy planet Earth. God had the perfect right and a very good reason and motivation to destroy the entire creation, because thanks to Adam, the entire creation was now sinful! Like a little drop of ink on a huge white piece of paper or cloth, that one little blot means that it is no longer totally, completely perfectly white anymore! Instead, it is only “mostly white”, and by God’s standard, “mostly white” isn’t good enough.
But God didn’t destroy creation. Why? Because He loves His creation. It is the work of His hands and it is precious to Him. So even though He had no obligation to and had every reason not to, God so loved His creation that He sent His only begotten Son to preserve some of it for eternity. (That is the true meaning of John 3:16). So, it is only by God’s grace, God’s love, that ANY of creation continued to exist for even an instant after Adam sinned. Because all of creation is sinful, all things and all people, God is not under obligation to save any thing or any one. Instead of charging God with cruelty, incompetence, aloofness or injustice for not intervening to save everyone, the opposite is true: it is only because of God’s grace and love that He saves anyone. All deserve God’s wrath; all deserve death and destruction. It is only because of God’s great love, because of God’s willingness to suffer the continued existence of a creation that is an abomination in His sight because of its fallen condition, that ANY person is able to experience the great privilege of living, existing, and getting to know the benefits of God’s love and grace even for a single second, because even that single second is more of God’s love and grace than any of us deserve. (For more on this topic, see How Can A Loving God Send People To Hell? Answering Requires Knowing What Love Is).
Now allow me to preface this with the caveat that the doctrine of providence means that God ultimately controls and is responsible for everything and uses all events to accomplish His purposes. This is indeed true, for denying it in any part results in establishing deism in an equal part. Still – and continuing to tread very carefully (and please realize that I am not a trained or professional theologian, so suffer my limitations) – please strongly consider the notion that God does not have to act to cause a calamity or a “bad thing” because they would happen anyway. Remember: creation in its original state was perfect, in complete harmony, so much so that the Bible even declared it self-sustaining after a manner of speaking (i.e. the plants and animals reproduced themselves). Adam’s fall introduced sin, or imperfection, which disrupted this disharmony. With Adam’s sin, death entered the world. So, because of Adam’s sin, things like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions (not to mention disease, wars and famines) are going to naturally happen simply due to the marred, flawed corrupted state of creation itself.
God does not have to act in order to cause a “bad thing” to happen, and it certainly does not have to be the result of a specific punishment for a specific sin. Quite the contrary, the bad things that happen are just the result of flawed machinery (with the flaw being due to sin) exhibiting its lack of perfection. It is analogous to how a poorly tuned automobile will still sputter, make bad noises and get poor fuel economy even if the driver commits no error in operating it.
Now it is true that the Bible does record various instances of God’s unleashing natural disasters and other widespread calamities to punish sin and wickedness. Examples include Sodom and Gomorrah, the flood of Noah, the woes against peoples and nations given by the Old Testament prophets, and the things spoken of in Revelation. They also include the famines, plagues, lost wars etc. experienced by Israel during her times of infidelity to her heavenly King. It is based on this that whenever there is a natural disaster, invariably certain Christians will suggest that it was a punishment meted out by God for wickedness, such as the infamous statements of Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson blaming abortion, homosexuality and other right wing culture war hot button issues for one calamity or another. Curious that these folks never seem to blame such things on injustice to the poor or minorities, a failure to take care of orphans and widows, corporate greed, or waging unjust wars despite God’s prophets in the Old Testament – and Jesus Christ in the New Testament! – also listing those as reasons for God’s judgments.
With the former, while these events certainly do seem to occur with some degree of frequency in the Bible, realize that they occurred over the course of thousands of years (yes, I am a young earth creationist) of Biblical history, and that their inclusion in the Biblical text is precisely because they were so rare. (It stretches credulity, for instance, to claim that the total destruction of the entire population of a large city in a natural disaster, as happened with Sodom and Gomorrah, is anything approaching a routine occurrence.) And in the case of Israel, please realize that they were a unique case: the nation created and called out by God among all the nations to serve His unique purposes. As part of Israel’s election, God gave them the Sinai covenant, which contained blessings if Israel was faithful and curses if they were not. When Israel failed to keep the covenant, then God did act to punish them for their sinfulness. But it is theologically wrong – and dangerous – to claim that God does the same with other nations with whom He did not establish a blessings and cursings covenant. Sadly, not a few religious leaders do exactly that because of either covenant theology, or even more cynically, religious right politics, which causes them to assert the existence of “Christian nations” that are products of God’s providence and therefore subject to God’s blessings if the populace is faithful to Him, and God’s curses if it is not. These claims simply cannot be supported by scripture and should be rejected, along with the notion that any contemporary nation, including America, is “a Christian nation created by God as part of His special plan.”
As for Revelation (and similar prophecies elsewhere such as the Olivet discourse) there is the belief that widespread disasters are increasing in frequency and severity because we are in the last days before the return of Jesus Christ. That is more legitimate theologically, but even there we have to be careful: people have used calamities and misfortunes in their time to claim that Jesus Christ’s return is nigh upon us for centuries. Also, while certain things – especially wars – have gotten particularly severe in the past 100 years, let us not forget that Black Death nearly wiped out Europe, and in the 6th and 7th centuries Islam nearly succeeded in conquering the known world.
Further, it may not even necessarily take specific judgments of God to result in the increasing frequency and severity of disasters, but instead it might simply be fallen creation exhibiting more and worse dysfunction as time goes on, similar to the problems that a house built on a warped, cracked foundation would have as the years go by. And for those with premillennial eschatology in particular, there is little evidence to support natural disasters oft or usually occurring as the result of specific judgments from God until the seven years of the great tribulation. Of course, those with different endtimes views, especially the historicist viewpoint that holds that the various judgments of Revelation have been occurring throughout the history of the church, see things differently.
Even so, it is far more likely that God has worked to graciously and mercifully prevent more natural disasters – and has limited the severity of and the loss of life from the disasters that do occur – than He has caused to happen because of judgments. So, just as it is with popular misconceptions of God’s sovereignty, a lot of the “God caused this to happen to punish those people for their sins!” talk is actually backwards. The Biblical evidence suggests that ever since the flood of Noah, God has sought to act mercifully and graciously to limit having to mete out such punishments. An example was the Tower of Babel, where God intervened to prevent mankind from accomplishing a great evil, which would have provoked God’s wrath in response.
Understanding great tragedies such as Japan and the even more devastating tsunami of 2004 (killing 230,000 people in 14 countries) requires beginning with an appropriate view of God, then a correct measure of man (and the rest of creation) in relationship to God, and next an attempt to grasp the true, severe, devastating cosmic consequences of the fall of Adam. Often, we only view Adam’s fall in soteriological terms: because of his actions men are doomed to an eternity in the lake of fire unless they are saved through Jesus Christ. While that is certainly true, it is unhelpful to limit Adam’s actions only to that sense, as if the eternal fate of humanity is all that truly matters. Such is man-centered thinking. Instead, we must realize that all of God’s creation is very special to and loved by Him, and that it was all of God’s creation that was made unacceptable to God as a result of Adam’s actions. As much as it pains us to see the death and misery due to these natural disasters, we must realize that it hurts God even more. Not only does God love each and every person that perished in that earthquake and tsunami, God also loves the planet itself that cracked and moaned that tragic day. (For example, imagine your own distress were a favorite and valuable piece of china passed down to you from a beloved family member were to badly chip or crack, and multiply that by a great many times.) This is why environmentalists who tell us to “love the earth” are so misguided … far better to love the God who loves the earth more than we ever could! God loves His creation, and it pains God to see the condition of disrepair that His beloved treasure that He created and sustains has come to because of Adam’s actions.
But there is good news: this marred, groaning crumbling creation will not exist forever. Quite the contrary: its time is limited. At the time appointed by God the Father, this current creation will pass away – be destroyed by fire – and replaced with a new creation, a new heaven and a new earth. A mere man will not be the head of the kosmos to come as Adam was of this kosmos! Instead, the head of the kosmos to come is Jesus Christ, who being God will not fall and plunge it into sin (ignore the doctrines of the heretic Origen who claims otherwise). Also, the people united with Jesus Christ? Well, they are the part of the prior kosmos that God will preserve for an eternity in the new kosmos, as a “keepsake” of the old kosmos. Why will God preserve some of the old kosmos when it is sinful and unacceptable? Because He so loved it! John 3:16! (Kosmos means “world”.) And by uniting the remnant of the former kosmos with Jesus Christ, the keepsake from the former kosmos will have its sinful status expunged, purged, extinguished, never to be remembered, spoken of or thought of before. So, God will have a reminder of His original work AND a new work that will be preserved forever by His Son: the best of both worlds! Does the God of the universe deserve anything less? Soli Deo Gloria!
But in order for this to be good news for you, you must be part of the kosmos that is united with Jesus Christ and thereby preserved. Otherwise, you will be in the portion of the marrred, unsuitable kosmos that will be rejected by the holy, perfect God and destroyed by fire … or more accurately the lake of fire. And against the doctrine of annihilationism, as time does not exist in eternity, the old creation’s being cast into the lake of fire will be just as eternal as the joy of the saints in heaven (cf Revelation 14:11). So in order to be the part of this world that is preserved forever instead of destroyed forever, you must obey Acts 2:38, which reads (in part) “Repent , and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.” For more detail on how this is done, I urge you to immediately read and heed:

1. Some use incidents as these as evidence that America is turning away from Christianity. My position is that nations and governments are all of the world, and as such have rejected Jesus Christ and will be judged by this same Jesus Christ. While the rejection of Jesus Christ by our nation and its institutions is perhaps more overt in some respects than in the past, and while there probably are indeed fewer legitimate Christians in America in terms of the percentage of the population than there were in times past, America is still as it always was … of the world. The church of Jesus Christ is the ekklesia, the elect that is called out of the world. Further, America is just one of many nations that has existed and will exist in human history. While God has used America’s Christians to do a lot of great things (i.e. in missionary evangelism), let us not fall into the deceptive thinking that America has a special standing before God; that America is or ever was in some sort of covenant relationship with God, or any of the other myths of American culture and tradition. There was only one nation brought into existence as an act of special creation by God with the purpose of being the light to the nations. That nation was Israel, and Israel’s purpose was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. God did not create America or any other nation to carry out the purposes that Jesus Christ – God in the flesh – already accomplished.
2. For the record, I agree with what Franklin Graham said against Islam. This places me in league with virtually all of the supporters of Graham in this controversy. The point of divergence is that I will apply what Graham said against Islam to Judaism, Mormonism, Roman Catholicism and any other false or heretical religion or belief system that denies God’s revelation and exalts itself against the God of the Bible. So Graham attacks Islam, suffers (minor) consequences for it, and is the evangelical hero of the moment in some quarters. But suppose Graham were to say the same about Judaism? These same people wouldn’t touch him with a ten foot pole. Many of them would be front and center denouncing Graham as anti-Semitic and hateful, and they would by no means be limited to premillennial dispensationalists. The very same people who run their little “Jihad Watch” websites and blogs reciting violent statements in the Koran ignore that the very same exhortations to commit genocide and kill nonbelievers appear in the Old Testament, making them perfectly valid for Jews to practice. They know full well that Jews are operating in darkness because they reject the New Testament revelation – that of an explicitly fully revealed Jesus Christ – that puts the Old Testament into context. Yet had Graham gone after Jews the way that he did Muslims, how many people would find his being expelled from the Pentagon prayer event to be overly objectionable? The same number as would had Graham said those things against Roman Catholics and Mormons. The conservative evangelicals on the religious right, who rely on conservative Catholics, Mormons and Jews, would in particular be apoplectic. Which, of course, is why you rarely hear evangelical leaders speaking against those false religions anymore.
Yes, I know that Franklin Graham made those comments after September 11th, when Muslims killed a great many Americans. But in addition to Graham’s unwillingness to challenge Roman Catholics on their many heresies because he is an ecumenical sort like his father, it is curious that Graham was moved to such strong speech by Muslims’ killing Americans but not Americans’ killing Muslims. What does Graham think of our overthrowing the Iranian government over oil profits? What does Graham think of our overthrowing the Iraqi government to put Saddam Hussein in power, and then sponsoring Hussein’s Iraq government in a war against this same Iran (after they turned on us) that killed millions of Muslims? What does Graham think of first war against Iraq, which happened because Hussein invaded Kuwait as part of a scheme to get OPEC to raise oil prices because our proxy war against Iran left his nation broke? What does Graham think of the crushing sanctions against Iraq after the first Iraq War, or the second Iraq War? Apparently, it is just fine for America to kill millions of Muslims with wars, proxy wars and sanctions. We’re America, and we can do whatever we want, right? But when the Muslim world responds to our killing millions of THEM by killing a few thousand of US, this is how Graham responds (and keep in mind, this was Graham’s softened public relations backtrack from his original, harsher comments)? Graham talks about how Islam treats its women when America invented pornography and is trying to impose legalized abortion on the rest of the world through the U.N. and other NGOs?
Here is a quote: “Graham later wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal saying he did not believe Muslims were evil because of their faith, but “as a minister … I believe it is my responsibility to speak out against the terrible deeds that are committed as a result of Islamic teaching.” Fine. But let’s hear Graham, as a minister, replace “Muslim” with “Jew”, “Mormon”, “Roman Catholic”, “Jehovah’s Witness” or “AMERICAN” in that sentence. Theologically, he would be justified. But if he did, the same people defending him over this now would have rejected him over it. The reason is that these people aren’t interested in legitimate Bible-based Christianity. If they were, it would be Muslim, Mormon, Jew, Catholic … six of one, half a dozen of the other.
Instead, these people are fighting political and cultural battles. Because after all, politics and culture – the world – is the only sphere where preferring the Muslim to the Jew or Catholic makes sense. It’s the only sphere where an aggressively hostile attitude towards Muslims can coexist with the “Christians must support Israel!” mindset when in truth there is no New Testament justification for EITHER.
Now again, what Franklin Graham said against Islam was 100% true. The problem is that the same people who supported Graham in what he said against Islam would abandon him in a heartbeat were he to say the same against Jews, Catholics, or for that matter whatever policy that got us into this Iraq/Iran mess. The reason for this double standard, this hypocrisy is worldliness, and this worldliness is not something that can be blamed on the people that had Graham disinvited from the prayer event.

This is the same that motivates evolution. Evolution advocates are motivated by their determination to reject the idea that God owns creation and controls it. Now some, including a number of professed Christians, are willing to acknowledge that God accomplished creation. However, they are unwilling to acknowledge that God wholly owns it, sustains it, holds it in His hands, and is the sole determiner of its ultimate destiny. Acknowledging this fact makes man accountable to God, and requires that man live his life in service to Him. Environmentalism – the idea that man can destroy the earth either against God’s will or with God doing nothing to stop it – and evolution are merely attempts to deny that man’s purpose is nothing other than to serve, worship and glorify God. That is the sum total of the purpose and reason for man’s existence, it is the reason why God created man. Denying our imperative to serve God is the motivating factor for denying or minimizing God’s role in our creation through evolution, and the same is the goal of denying that God will determine the destiny of the earth and humankind through environmentalism.
And it explains the religious fervor attached to both, and the vehement Inquisition-like tactics that those who reject environmentalism and evolution are subjected to. Indeed, global warming dissenters are actually now
being accused of killing people (i.e. inaction on climate change because of skeptics is alleged to have caused natural disasters, diseases, famines etc.) and there are even claims that opposition to evolution is hindering medical breakthroughs that would save many lives. Such people are advancing the case that opposition to environmentalism and evolution can no longer be matters of private conscience, opinions that must be abided in a free society, but dangerous deadly notions that must be stamped out in order to save lives, or even humanity.
Of course, as evolution and environmentalism constitutes a different and competing belief system – a religion if you will – to Christianity, this should be no surprise. Why should the global warming/evolution crowd be any more accommodating to Christianity than Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, or the mythology of the ancient Roman Empire? The issue, then is why so many professed evangelicals are choosing the path of syncretism by becoming anti-global warming “creation care” Christians, thereby mixing a belief system based on and motivated by denying God’s sovereignty, providence, omnipotence, ownership rights over creation, and prerogative to exercise those rights with a Christian belief system that affirms all of those as core doctrines.
It is even more curious that many of these people fully embrace the “creation care” part while rejecting the evolution part, blissfully blinded to the fact that they are one and the same. Evidence of this is the common justification for the “creation care” idea: God gave (ceded!) dominion of the earth to man (Adam) so we must use it wisely. That is merely quasi-deism which ignores a great deal of Biblical content, including but not limited to the effects of the fall of Adam (i.e. the curse on Adam and rule of the earth transferring from Adam to Satan) and of course Jesus Christ being the second Adam and creation’s current, forever and rightful ruler. But then again, when your goal is to be relevant and influential within the cultural and political mainstream, why let a little theology or syncretism get in the way? And amazing that the dispensationalists among the creation care movement seem oblivious to the fact that the global warming ideology is ultimately motivated by a desire to reject the book of Revelation and the judgment of God upon the earth that it describes!

However, if this article is correct, because of pollution, homosexuality is only one of the many unnatural things caused by pollution. It is still more evidence that we are living in the last days, and that we need Jesus Christ as our Lord and savior.

The “Point of Service” model is very simple to administer, and is particularly appealing since it requires minimal administrative resources.
To ensure each participant receives maximum program benefits, the following five key elements are emphasized throughout our informational materials:
From a business perspective, HPP’s Prescription Savings program is a valuable benefit, providing a measurable savings to those who most need to save money on prescription medication purchases. Budget-conscious families appreciate the fact this program is provided at no monthly cost, is easy to understand, and achieves definable savings prior to purchasing medication. Most importantly, the program’s structure enables participants to be prudent purchasers and to be actively involved in receiving the best value for their health care dollar.

I know that people on the low-carb or Paleo diets don’t want to hear this, but the source of your protein really does matter. This recently published study found an increased risk of dying for those who consumed more animal products who had one other lifestyle risk factor such as smoking, physical activity, or overweight/obesity. In particular, eating animal protein was linked with a higher risk of heart disease.
In contrast, eating more plant-proteins was linked with lower mortality and lower risk of disease. This is not the first study to find this link! In fact, eating more plant proteins is associated with lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels and makes insulin work better. In addition, substituting plant proteins for animal proteins lowers the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes.

Eating more plants and less meat is becoming more popular than ever thanks to ex-presidents, celebrities, best-selling books, and movies such as Forks Over Knives. While vegetarian and vegan diets, are defined by what they exclude, a plant-based diet is defined by what it includes—lots of plant foods! This means eating more veggies, fruits, beans, peas, lentils, whole grains, nuts, and seeds instead of animal products and processed foods.
Dr. Dean Ornish’s research showed that eating a very-low fat, plant-based, vegetarian diet and other lifestyle changes, could, in fact, reverse heart disease. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn also succeeded in arresting and reversing heart disease in patients who were seriously ill.
The Adventist Health Study-2 found that vegetarians had a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. While about 50 percent of Americans will develop high blood pressure by the age of 60, research shows that populations that consume a diet comprised mostly of vegetables or who are vegetarian have “virtually no increase in hypertension with age.”
Eating red meat (beef, pork, and lamb) is associated with increased rates of cancer and heart disease. And the American Cancer Society recommends eating a healthy diet for the prevention of cancer “…with an emphasis on plant foods”
Lastly, compelling new animal research has found that eating meat causes the bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract to produce a compound that increases the risk of atherosclerosis (clogged arteries).
Let face it. If you are eating a lot of plant foods, many of which have only 10 to 50 calories per cup, you are going to lose weight. If you eat these foods in place of fast, fatty, processed, and sweet foods, you will cut out a ton of calories—and the best part is—you will feel full!
The classic American meal is a burger, fries, and a coke. At McDonalds, you can buy the following for 1,140 calories:
It takes about 15 pounds of grain to produce 1 pound of beef and about 5 pounds of grain to produce 1 pound of chicken. We grow a lot of grain to feed animals, but we would use less water and other energy resources if we ate the grain ourselves.
An article in Scientific American reveals that the amount of beef the average American eats in a year creates as much greenhouse gas as driving a car over 1,800 miles!
A report released by the Environmental Working Group actually calculated how much greenhouse gas is produced by the food we eat. As you can see, animal products are the highest producers. So forget the lamb and eat the lentils!
Many people think eating fast food, such as McDonald’s, is the cheapest way to eat. But actually eating plant-based foods can cost even less.
A McDonald’s meal for four people—including 2 Big Macs, a 6-piece Chicken McNuggets meal, a small hamburger, 4 medium fries, and 4 medium drinks—costs around $24.00.
But you could have lentil soup, salad, fruit, and sparkling mineral water, for four people for about $10.00!
Granted, you would spend more time cooking the lentil soup. However, you could make a large pot, put it in the frig or freezer, and have it for lunch or dinner over the next few days ultimately saving both time and money.
Beans, peas, and lentils are some of the cheapest foods you can buy. And a recent report even shows that fruits and veggies are more economical than we once thought.
None of us wants to see the horrific treatment that animals are subjected to for our benefit. I know I certainly don’t. But I think it is important for all of us to understand how animal are treated so that we can make a conscious choice.
I will mention just one example, as a case in point: gestation crates for pigs. Once the sows are artificially inseminated, they are put in crates with just enough room for their bodies for their entire pregnancy. As the sows gets larger and larger they often develop pressure sores. They urinate and defecate through slots in the bottom of the crate. The smell of ammonia is strong enough to cause lung problems. Once the sow delivers it is back in the gestation crate. When the animals are spent, they are taken to slaughter. They use these horrific practices to save money and produce more meat, but at what cost? Pigs are intelligent animals and I just cannot be a part of this kind of suffering to save a few dollars.
I am not a vegan, I do occasionally eat animal products, mostly fish and eggs, but when I do eat them I go out of my way buy products from animals that have been humanely raised. One example is Vital Farms eggs. Yes, I pay more for them. However, for the very small amount of animal products I do eat, it’s worth it and does not break the bank.
It’s hard to argue with a plant-based diet when it benefits our health, waistline, environment, wallet, and conscience. Any movement towards more plants and less meat is a big step in the right direction. Why not skip the meat and eat some beans today?

Recently, a randomized control trial was published looking at the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the primary prevention of heart disease. In other words, does the Mediterranean diet prevent heart disease in people that never had it?
A total of 7,447 men and women were enrolled; none with heart disease, but all were at high risk for it. They were randomized into three groups.
An experimental group, which was instructed on the Mediterranean diet with the addition of olive oil
Another experimental group, which was instructed on the Mediterranean diet with added nuts (walnuts or hazelnuts).
The investigators found that the Mediterranean diet lowered the risk of major cardiovascular events, in particular stroke. This trial adds even more evidence to the pile of research in support of the Mediterranean diet.
But…there has also been some criticism of this research, primarily from the low-fat vegan crowd. Dr. Ornish wrote an article on this research in the Huffington Post.
He says, and rightly so, that “The comparison (control) group did not follow a low-fat diet. As the authors wrote, “We acknowledge that, even though participants in the control group received advice to reduce fat intake, changes in total fat were small.” This is not surprising, since they gave the control group virtually no support at all in following this diet during the first half of the study.”
He also says that “The authors should have concluded that the Mediterranean diet reduced cardiovascular risk when compared to whatever diet they were eating before, not when compared to a low-fat diet, since patients in the control group (“low-fat diet”) were not consuming a low-fat diet.”
The great news is that both diets are linked with lower rates of heart disease. That’s not surprising considering that both have some key components in common including lots of plant based foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, peas, lentils, not much or no red meat, and minimal processed foods.
Both diets impact traditional risk factors for heart disease such as high blood cholesterol or blood pressure. But even more compelling, both diets positively impact the novel risk factors highlighted in the graphic below such as inflammation, arrhythmic risk (irregular and deadly heart beats), endothelial dysfunction (unstable plaque), and thrombosis (clot formation).
There are a few differences between the diets. Mediterranean diet followers consume higher amounts of DHA and EPA, also known as omega-3 fats, which are linked with lower rates of heart disease. These fats decrease the risk of clots and stabilize the heart beat. But the low-fat vegan diet has been found to actually reverse heart disease. And people who consume this diet have less stiffness of the arteries, which is what causes high blood pressure as we get older. This is practically unheard of in folks consuming meat.
So we have reason to celebrate! We have two viable options for people to consume that will help lower the risk of heart disease. I am hoping you are doing what you can to eat more veggies and less meat.

Based on the most recent evidence, your sodium goal is from about 2,300 to 2,400 mg a day. However, most Americans consume between 3,500 to 5,000 mg per day, which is well above the recommended amount.
Eating mostly unprocessed foods including fruits, veggies, milk, bread, and chicken or other animal protein offers about 1,000 mg of sodium. If you add just a ½ teaspoon of salt, that adds another 1,000 mg. However, for most Americans, 80 percent of our sodium comes from processed, fast, and restaurant food. For example, one biscuit has about 600 mg, one ounce of American cheese has 270 mg, one tablespoon of soy sauce has 1,000 mg, and one hot dog about 510 mg.
If you eat out, the sodium amounts are even higher. Panda Express Two Entrée meal with Orange Chicken has a whopping 2,300 mg of sodium, In and Out Burgers Double Double has 1,440 mg, and even the seemingly healthy McDonalds Grilled Chicken Sandwich has 1,030.
Pay attention to what you are eating. Ask about the sodium amounts in fast and restaurant foods and check the Nutrition Facts on packages.
Cut out the salt you add while cooking or at the table. Use herbs, spices, vinegar (I especially like balsamic), garlic, onions, wine, or spice mixes such as Mrs. Dash or Trader Joe’s 21 Seasoning Salute instead.
Most importantly, eat more fresh, healthy foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, and lentils.
The great news is that your taste buds will get used to a lower sodium amount in just 3 to 4 weeks. Even a small decrease the amount of sodium you consume will have a big effect on your risk of a heart attack or stroke.

All referees affiliated with FIFA have a designated referee grade. Most referees begin their career as USSF Grade 8, entry level, (grade refers to referee level, not school grade) which allows them to officiate youth travel games. After more experience and testing, referees can move "up" to higher grade levels 7, 6, 5 etc. The grade indicates the qualification of the referee to officiate at various levels of local, national and international soccer competition. There is a common misconception that these grades are related to elementary or secondary school grades - they are not, they are assigned by USSF. For more information on USSF referee grades go to: www.usyouthsoccer.org/referees/gradesexplained
Grass Roots Entry level grade 8 (this is the referee level, NOT school grade) "Yellowshirt" testing is currently: OPEN until August 31st, 2018.

If you’re already familiar with podcasts, you can find Jump Start Your Joy on iTunes, Google Play, or TuneIn Radio to subscribe. The show is also available on Pocket Casts and Stitcher. I launch a new episode every Tuesday morning.

If this is all new to you, here’s a quick tutorial on how to find the app, and subscribe to your favorite shows.:

Step 5. From the “Jump Start Your Joy” page (seen below) press the Subscribe button. Subscribing is free and you’ll get the latest episode downloaded to your phone each and every Tuesday.
Step 6. The most recent episode should download auto-magically. If you want to download a specific episode you can click the download icon (cloud with down arrow) next to each episode.
Step 7. You can view and play all of those episodes by clicking the Unplayed icon in the bottom left of the screen, which displays any downloaded episode that you haven’t listened to yet.
Bonus: If you’re just trying to see if you like a new show, you can find everything in that show’s catalog by clicking the feed button, and playing episodes that way (before you decide if you want to subscribe).

Former NBA player and general manager Steve Kerr wrote a piece for ESPN's Grantland.com in which he makes a case for the league raising the age limit from 19 to 20. In his article, Kerr lists six reasons why he believes the NBA would be a better business with an age limit of 20.
For my own selfish reasons I'd love to see the age limit raised to 20. The reason college football and the NFL seem to have such a great relationship is that we get to see stars play at least three years in college and we know their names and games by the time they are drafted in the NFL.
There is a huge disconnect between college basketball and the NBA. Since nobody watches college basketball until March, we see these one-and-done's for a month, and just as we're getting to know them they are off to the NBA. I certainly don't begrudge them for that, but it makes it harder for fans to drum up interest in college basketball.
As a former general manager, Kerr takes the standpoint of a front office executive. He makes plenty of compelling arguments that lead to the hypothesis that everyone would benefit in the long run.

Five lots sold for 300,000 guineas (US $400,406) or more on the second day of the Tattersalls Autumn Horses in Training Sale with Middle Eastern buyers dominating proceedings. The turnover and average both eclipsed the figures set on this day last year whilst the clearance rate improved to a remarkable 88 percent.
The high quality three-year-old Corrosive is set to continue his career in the Middle East after being knocked down to Ibrahim Rashid for 450,000 guineas ($600,608) after he saw off the efforts of Anthony Stroud.

“He is bought primarily for the King’s Cup in Saudi Arabia,” said Rashid, “but he will also go to the Dubai Carnival. The horse is a very good mover, he has a big heart and he vetted very well.”
Rob Speers, racing manager for former owner Vefa Ibrahim Araci, was on hand to see the horse sell and he said: “The horse has progressed through the year to become a very good handicapper. He has a global appeal and goes on the faster ground.”
Corrosive was purchased at the 2017 Tattersalls Craven Breeze Up for 150,000 guineas ($200,196) by Speers.

The son of Fastnet Rock, who has a Timeform Rating of 115, was secured by St Lawrence after he saw off agents Anthony Stroud and Saad Bin Mishraf.
“Euginio is a sound, willing, Group 3 winner, he goes on the good to firm and will suit racing in Dubai. We were very keen to get him,” he added.
The 4-year-old was consigned to the sale by Richard Hannon’s East Everleigh Stables on behalf of owners Saleh Al Homaizi and Imad Al Sagar. Racing manager Tony Nerses was in the sale ring to watch the horse sell and he said: “We are delighted with that price, but I think they’ve got a bargain! The horse is very genuine and is still improving.”
Explaining the horse’s sale, Nerses said: “We are just having a little ‘thinning’ out as we have just grown a little too big too quickly.”

However, a woman claiming to be Ikue, younger sister to Yohei's actual birth mother, moves in next door and asks that Yohei moves in with her. While Yohei is in a state of confusion, the three women attempt to use their voluptuous bodies to seduce him.

The Sedalia City Council met in the council chambers of City Hall for a work session Monday night (April 29). There were three items on the agenda, but the one that drew the capacity crowd to the chamber was the proposal that would make Sedalia a smoke-free city.
City Attorney Ann Gardner gave a Powerpoint presentation of the ordinance that is close to one the City of Lee’s Summit has at this time. If enacted, the ordinance will affect virtually all business places within the city limits, including bars, restaurants and private clubs.
There were both opponents and proponents who came to the microphone to speak to the council about their views on the subject. The council had already stipulated that no vote would be taken at the meeting. At the end of the work session the council decided to hold another work session on the smoke free ordinance on the May 13.
KSIS will be at the meeting and will bring you an update on the proposal to make Sedalia a smoke free community. Take our poll below and let us know if you would support the ordinance.

A new report from a British anti-poverty organization says eight men own as much wealth as the poorest 3.6 billion people in the world.
Oxfam International released the report on Monday. Oxfam is a group of international organizations that seek to fight poverty around the world.
The group warned that public anger over inequality might cause more political changes. Examples of such changes, Oxfam said, include the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president and Britain’s vote to withdraw from the E.U.
The report appears as international political and business leaders meet at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. This yearly event gathers leaders, experts and activists to discuss important international issues.
Oxfam released a similar report last year. That report suggested 62 people owned as much wealth as half the world’s population. The activist group says new information from Swiss bank Credit Suisse and Forbes magazine shows that fewer people hold more of the wealth.
Forbes lists Bill Gates as the wealthiest individual. The magazine says he is worth about $75 billion.
Following Gates on the list are Amancio Ortega of the Spanish ?clothing company Inditex and American businessman Warren Buffett. Also among the eight are Mexican businessman Carlos Slim Helu and Amazon head Jeff Bezos.
They are followed by Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and former New York City mayor and media businessman Michael Bloomberg.
Winnie Byanyima is the executive director of Oxfam International. She will be attending the World Economic Forum meetings in Switzerland. She hopes to discuss the problems inequality causes with world leaders.
“It is obscene for so much wealth to be in the hands of so few people when 1 in 10 people live on less than $2 a day,” Byanyima told the Associated Press. “Inequality is trapping hundreds of millions in poverty; it is fracturing our societies and undermining democracy.”
Oxfam offered possible solutions to economic inequality in its report. These include higher taxes on wealth and income to pay for more public services. The group also calls on business leaders to pay their share of taxes.
Max Lawson is the head of policy for Oxfam. He urged extremely rich people to, in his words, “do the right thing.”
“We have a situation where billionaires are paying less tax often than their cleaner, or their secretary” Lawson told the Associated Press. “That’s crazy.”
Last year, the release of financial documents known as the “Panama Papers” showed how some wealthy people avoid paying taxes. The leaked documents were a collection of information about secret bank accounts some wealthy people used to hide their wealth.
On Monday, another report warned that income inequality has led to a decrease in trust in governments and other institutions.
Edelman is one of the world’s biggest marketing companies. The company studied the opinions of 33,000 people from 28 different international markets before the start of this years’ World Economic Forum.
Edelman said its study found the largest drop of trust in government, business, media and non-governmental organizations yet. The company has reported on its trust and credibility survey for 16 years.
Trust of chief executive officers of companies is at an all-time low, according to Edelman. The report added that government leaders are the least trusted group.

China today is never out of the news: from human rights controversies and the continued legacy of Tiananmen Square, to global coverage of the Beijing Olympics, and the Chinese 'economic miracle'. It seems a country of contradictions: a peasant society with some of the world's most futuristiccities, heir to an ancient civilization that is still trying to find a modern identity. This iVery Short Introduction/i offers the reader with no previous knowledge of China a variety of ways to understand the world's most populous nation, giving a short, integrated picture of modern Chinesesociety, culture, economy, politics and art.
Recent events—from strife in Tibet and the rapid growth of Christianity in China to the spectacular expansion of Chinese Buddhist organizations around the globe—vividly demonstrate that one cannot understand the modern Chinese world without attending closely to the question of religion.The Religious Question in Modern Chinahighlights parallels and contrasts between historical events, political regimes, and cultural movements to explore how religion has challenged and responded to secular Chinese modernity, from 1898 to the present. Vincent Goossaert and David A. Palmer piece together the puzzle of religion in China not by looking separately at different religions in different contexts, but by writing a unified story of how religion has shaped, and in turn been shaped by, modern Chinese society. From Chinese medicine and the martial arts to communal temple cults and revivalist redemptive societies, the authors demonstrate that from the nineteenth century onward, as the Chinese state shifted, the religious landscape consistently resurfaced in a bewildering variety of old and new forms.The Religious Question in Modern Chinaintegrates historical, anthropological, and sociological perspectives in a comprehensive overview of China’s religious history that is certain to become an indispensible reference for specialists and students alike.
Beautifully written by a leading scholar in the field, the new edition of The Search for Modern China brings to life the characters and events of China’s turbulent modern history. The narrative is detailed balanced, integrating political and cultural history with social and economic developments. Spence has streamlined and thoroughly updated the text in light of new scholarship and the major new steps China has taken in the last ten years. The Search for Modern China, Second Edition, features a visually striking art program that includes more than 150 illustrations-many by world-famous photographers-50 maps, and many helpful tables.
China's transformation in the last few decades has been perhaps the most remarkable -- and most controversial -- development in modern history. Barely a century removed from the struggling and out-dated Qing Empire, China has managed to reinvent itself on an unprecedented scale: from Empire, to Communist state, to hybrid capitalist superpower. Yet the full implications of China's rapid march to modernity are not widely understood -- particularly, the effects of China's meteoric rise on the nation's many ethnic minorities.China: A Modern Historyis the definitive guide to this complex contemporary phenomenon. Deng Xiaoping's 1980s policy of 'reform and opening," which saw China enter the world market, is only the most recent in a series of dramatic shifts that have transformed Chinese society over the past 150 years.China: A Modern Historyexplores these contrasts in detail, while also highlighting the enduring values which have informed Chinese identity for millennia. Michael Dillon'sChina: A Modern Historyis essential reading for those interested in the past, present and future course of one of the world's great nations. Clearly and compellingly written, this will stand as the best introduction to this spectacular and still-unfinished story.
China Modern showcases 39 innovative homes, bars and restaurants with Chinese-inspired interiors from locations including Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong.
Australia's Prime Minister Kevin Rudd famously said that China issues are part of 21st century Australia's 'very life-blood'. This brings short-term challenges to the Australia-China relationship, from Chinese investments in our resources to visits to Australia by expatriate regional political and religious leaders, labelled 'splittists' or 'terrorists', by the Chinese government. Our long-term relationship includes robust scholarship on China as an emerging superpower. In this book, leading Australian academics comment on arts, law, politics and society in China today. The book opens with Geremie Barmegrave;'s essay on re-orienting Beijing city for the Olympics and closes with restaurateur Kylie Kwong's reminiscences ndash; and recipes ndash; from a Chinese childhood in Sydney's suburbs. Readers will disover a rich engagement with China in the twelve chapters of this volume, ranging from Confucianism to 'green' Australian-Chinese cuisine.
China is a vast nation comprised of hundreds of distinct ethnic communities, each with its own language, history, and culture. Today the government of China recognizes just 56 ethnic nationalities, orminzu,as groups entitled to representation. This controversial new book recounts the history of the most sweeping attempt to sort and categorize the nation's enormous population: the 1954 Ethnic Classification project (minzu shibie). Thomas S. Mullaney draws on recently declassified material and extensive oral histories to describe how the communist government, in power less than a decade, launched this process in ethnically diverse Yunnan. Mullaney shows how the government drew on Republican-era scholarship for conceptual and methodological inspiration as it developed a strategy for identifyingminzuand how non-Party-member Chinese ethnologists produced a "scientific" survey that would become the basis for a policy on nationalities.
Where do home renovation myths start? Maybe in the aisles of your local hardware store or parking lot of the lumber yard. They get traded back and forth and whispered to people who may actually believe the tall tales—until they find themselves sitting under a pile of splintered wood and drywall dust.

It's like DWTS except the contestants are all overweight people. You do your best dances and lose weight. In pure theory, this might seem like a good idea Because there are a lot of ugly skinny people, too There is very big girl dating reality show time to get to know the contestants so a lot of what they judge on is based on appearance and I would be very suprised if a plus sized girl would get into the top 5.
That may not be fair but it is reality. Jabbadoo 8 big girl dating reality show Ugh. I dread seeing the stereotypes on this. Lane Bryant store was doing the casting interviews last winter. The title alone, "More To Love" is in my view insulting. Might as well call it "You've Got Such A Pretty Face". However at least all participants seem to be aware of what the show is, I wouldn't have been surprised if it had been some blindside of the guy big girl dating reality show know they were all fat, and he'd have to look deep inside himself to find that he could love a fat chick Watching Flavor Flav hand out clocks to a bunch of ratchet hos was one of the most joyous things we did each week.
But he was funny and charming and completely in on the joke. And of course, Queen New York. Man… if only they did that ish on The Bachelor. Then we would FOR SURE watch. So yes, they all totally choose dating for four years — that is, a love affair with some BENJAMINS.
It is, after all, big girl dating reality show television network for women who love men who hate women. Which is benefits of dating websites we LIIIIIVED for I Love New York. T hat one guy who is now engaged to Jennifer Hudson? Can we make her the next Bachelorette?
Except not at all. This was just a fun chance to laugh at how stupid and ignorant American women are. The show was cancelled mid-season. And none of the big girl dating reality show know this. Talk about a twist ending! The problem was that FOX basically advertised it as a modern day freak show. Bad Girls Need Love Too Oxygen, The subject line says it all: BAD GIRLS NEED LOVE TOO! So getting former Bad Girls Club cast-members in a room to look for the man of their dreams out of thirteen eligible bachelors?
And do you remember how like, one of the girls would be named HBIC each week and that girl would big girl dating reality show pick the dates of the other girls? That was a GENIUS twist. And girls, for big girl dating reality show matter! She was like a dumber Paris Hilton, and her search for a sugar daddy over the three episodes of the series we saw were really enjoyable. And then one of the contestants, Ryan Jenkins, killed his wife. And then killed himself. And VH1 cancelled that series because Jenkins had made it to third place on the show.
Well, you could, but that would be REALLY wack. Which is why we tune in, week after week, to see how it all goes down. And they say gay marriage is ruining marriage. FOX IS RUINING MARRIAGE. In a shocking twist, none of the couples end up married. I cannot have a black one! A lot of white people are still very much racist. All this according to a few of my friends, that have been around these circle of white men, and circles of white women. And yes, I know not all white people are racist.
But to each his own. Lee Lemon Kristy Love, did it ever occur to you that men like tight bodies, too? That people have different preferences and that a lot of fit men that do prefer bigger women. Pay Attention next time. She wants a man that takes care of himself and his health, yet she expects someone who puts effort into their appearance take care of her when she looses a foot to diabetes?
Fat man bodies are gross and so are fat women bodies. Loose weight or accept the fact that your dating prospects are slim. Can you not get your point across without always inserting disrespectful, impertinent talk? One example is when you are speaking of overweight people above. In another thread you speak of tolerance for homosexuals- yet you seem to have no tolerance for those who are overweight and say many negative effects dating rude comments in MANY threads about various topics.
Her NoBodyShame mantra is something I love and you can tell the show is very big on acceptance, but also change. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK. I think there are some awesome similarities. With that being said, I have had datlng write me to tell me to stop using the word FAT as a descriptor before. The show is more centered around dating as a plus sized woman. Although they have two VERY different casts, I have had someone write me to tell me to stop using the word FAT as a descriptor before, but also change, Ggirl am haaaardcore Big girl dating reality show. PARAGRAPHDisclosure Policy Big Girls on TV: These are shows that merely give you life of a bigger girl. FYI, I enjoy the show. PARAGRAPHDisclosure Policy Big Girls on TV: These are shows that merely give you life of big girl dating reality show bigger girl. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK. You can read my thoughts on both shows below? Also, look at this picture above. Would you ever be on one if you were approached?PARAGRAPH. I crack reailty just about every time she opens her mouth. The show is more centered around dating as a plus sized woman. My Dating website called fish something Fat Fabulous Life - This erality the one EVERYONE keeps asking me about. With that being said, I have had someone write me to tell me to stop using the sating FAT as a descriptor before! Also, and are absolutely hilarious?

The Cape petrel (Daption capense) is a seabird belonging to family Procellariidae. The Cape petrels are distributed in the Southern Ocean with an estimated population of two million. There are two recognized subspecies of these birds. The subspecies D. c. capense occurs in Antarctic and subantarctic islands. The subspecies D. c. australe occurs in Antarctic seas between Australasia, New Zealand and Antarctica. During the winter they range further north visiting African coast and Indian islands.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) had categorized and evaluated these petrel species and had listed them as of 'Least Concern'.
The Cape petrels are small birds, measuring 35 to40 cm in length and weighing 350 to500 grams. They have wingspan of 90 cm. Their head is black with white belly and breast. The underwings are white with black border. Their upper wings and back are black, speckled with white.
These petrels feed on krill, crustaceans, fish and squids. They seize their prey from the sea surface as well as by diving.under water. They produce stomach oil, which they spray out when threatened. These petrels have a salt gland in their nasal passage and excrete high saline solution to desaline themselves.

Facebook Inc will introduce a new video hub on the world’s largest social network Thursday, offering some US users short episodic series from content partners including A&E, Major League Baseball and National Geographic, in a bid to capture more online advertising dollars.
The new section, called Watch, is meant to increase the amount of time users spend watching video by giving them a place to follow and discuss original shows, which can then be shared via their news feeds and in Facebook groups, according to product director Daniel Danker. It will organize shows by what’s most talked about, what friends are watching and what the user is following.
“As people come to Facebook more and more to watch video, they want a reliable place to watch,” Danker said in an interview. Facebook paid to seed some of the original content that will appear in the section. Among the episodes: My Social Media Life, a reality show about internet celebrity David Lopez, and Great Cheese Hunt, in which Business Insider seeks out some of the world’s best cheese. Eventually, Facebook will roll out Watch to more users and show producers.
“We’re hoping to see thousands of shows created” as the product gets off the ground, Danker said. “The shows that we helped fund are really a small portion of that, and will be a shrinking portion over time.”
Facebook intends for the publishers to make money by splitting revenue from ads placed in the videos, or from creating videos with advertisers from the get-go. Facebook will bring in about 20 percent of the $83 billion advertisers spend online in the US this year, according to EMarketer. Google receives about 41 percent of that revenue.
The social media giant is just one of many technology companies funding original shows, from Snap Inc. to Google’s YouTube to Amazon.com Inc. Facebook’s approach bears more resemblance to YouTube than Netflix Inc. or Amazon given its focus on short-form videos designed to be shared online. The company also is backing a handful of TV-length episodes, but doesn’t want to fund videos in the long term.
Facebook hopes to keep users watching video on its apps for longer — and win more advertising dollars — by making the content more social, encouraging commenting and sharing as the shows air.
“The friend features will differentiate it,” said Matthew Segal, co-founder of ATTN, a digital media company. “You can do everything through the prism of your friends.” ATTN produced a couple of shows for Facebook, a health program hosted by actress Jessica Alba and a modern relationship advice show with Nev Schulman, producer of “Catfish.” Both are short-form, serialised programs that will be made available later this year.

In 1982, Raiders owner Al Davis beat the NFL in court and moved his team from Oakland to Los Angeles. With a squad as colorful as its owner, the Raiders captivated a large number of black and Hispanic fans in L.A. at a time when gang warfare, immigration and the real estate boom were rapidly changing the city. The L.A. Raiders morphed into a worldwide brand as the team’s colors, swagger and anti-establishment ethos became linked with the hip-hop scene that was permeating South Central Los Angeles. Rapper-turned-filmmaker Ice Cube was not only witness to this evolution, he was also a part of it. As a member of the notorious rap group N.W.A, Ice Cube helped make the silver and black culturally significant to a new generation and demographic. Still a die-hard Raiders fan, Cube will explore the unlikely marriage between the NFL’s rebel franchise and America’s glamour city and show how pro football’s outlaw team became the toast of La La Land.

Community Meeting October 11 on W&OD Trail Pedestrian and Bicycle Bridge Over Route 29 (Lee Highway)
FAIRFAX, Va. - The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) will host a community meeting to present the final design and aesthetic details for the Washington & Old Dominion Trail Pedestrian and Bicycle Bridge over U.S. Route 29 (Lee Highway) in Arlington. The design reflects input received during workshops held on April 5, May 2, and June 13, 2017.
The meeting will be held at Yorktown High School, 5200 Yorktown Blvd., Arlington, on Thursday, Oct. 11 from 6:30-8:30 p.m., with a presentation at 7 p.m. The trail bridge is being built as a component of the I-66 Inside the Beltway Eastbound Widening Project.
FAIRFAX, Va. - Crews will be shifting the travel lanes on I-66 East between the Dulles Connector Road and Lee Highway (Exit 69) this weekend, as part of the I-66 Inside the Beltway Eastbound Widening Project. Lanes will be shifted to the right (away from the Metro tracks) onto the shoulder to allow for widening work in the median of the roadway.
FAIRFAX – Overnight lane closures will begin on or about Sunday, August 26, on eastbound I-66 and will continue for approximately two months, weather permitting. The lane closures will happen nightly from 9:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. to allow crews to strengthen and repave the outside (right) shoulder of eastbound I-66 between the Dulles Connector Road (Route 267) and Fairfax Drive (Exit 71). Once completed, all I-66 eastbound travel lanes will be shifted toward the right side of the road and temporary traffic barriers will be installed on the left side of the roadway so that crews can begin widening work in the median. This work is part of the I-66 Inside the Beltway Eastbound Widening Project.
FAIRFAX – Single lane closures will continue on eastbound I-66 inside the Beltway during overnight hours (weather permitting) through the end of March from 9:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. each night. The closures will occur between I-495 and Fairfax Drive (Route 237) to allow crews to safely perform survey and geotechnical investigation work related to the I-66 eastbound widening project. Additionally, intermittent shoulder closures are planned (weather permitting) from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. Motorists should expect delays and are advised to use alternate routes.
FAIRFAX – Single, left lane closures are planned during overnight hours (weather permitting) Monday night, Jan. 29, through Friday morning, Feb. 2, and Sunday night, Feb. 4, through Friday morning, Feb. 9, from 9:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. each night on eastbound I-66 inside the Beltway, between I-495 and Fairfax Drive (Route 237), to allow crews to safely perform survey work related to the I-66 eastbound widening project.
FAIRFAX - Morning and afternoon commutes were faster and travel times more reliable during the first four days of I-66 Express Lanes Inside the Beltway operations, according to data released today by the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT).
FAIRAX - After nearly four full days of Express Lanes on I-66 Inside the Beltway being underway, the Virginia Department of Transportation reports that morning and afternoon commutes on Monday, Dec. 4, were faster than the same time last December. The average round-trip toll price during peak hours was $14.50, with the average morning toll during peak hours of $10.70 and average afternoon toll during the peak hours of $3.80. This toll rate during peak hours is lower than the estimated average toll rate of $17.00 during peak hours discussed in 2015.

If you have an elderly relative who is moving, whether to an assisted living community or simply relocating to a different home, you might have some concerns with how they will get it all done. Here are some different ways you can help them move.
Seniors often have difficulty with sorting the items they will bring with them to their new home along with organising belongings during the packing process. You can help your relative by helping with this process, but make sure you start as early as possible. Sorting their belongings can take a long time, especially if they are planning on relocating to a home that is considerably smaller than their current home. It is a good idea to go to their new home to take measurements or at least find out about the basic layout so you can help your loved one decide what furniture they can bring along and what might need to be left behind.
Another struggle with elderly persons moving is that they sometimes have difficulty packing up sentimental items. To avoid emotional turmoil while packing up what might be a home they have lived in for a long time, start in areas of the home with no sentimental attachment. For example, you can start going through their boxes in the garage, packing up items in the basement, or going through the bathrooms. Areas like the bedrooms and boxes of personal items in the attic tend to have more sentimental items, so you might want to leave these for last.
There are going to be some items your relative simply refuses to let go of, even though it isn't logical for them to bring the items to their new home. If the items absolutely won't fit in their new home, don't just tell them they have to get rid of it. This can be really hard for someone who might have a lot of memories associated with their belongings. Instead of being too harsh, offer to store the items elsewhere, either in your own garage or by getting them a self-storage unit.
The great thing about full-service movers is that they not only move furniture and boxes, but they also help to pack the boxes. You can help your relative go through their stuff, sort items, and get rid of what they aren't going to bring to the new home or a storage unit, but you can then have the full-service movers actually pack the boxes. They will also disassemble furniture items in the home, move all the boxes and furniture, then re-assemble the furniture. You can then unpack the boxes in the new home and help your relative put the items away.

I was out for a walk and a saw a homeless person with a sign. The front of the sign was blank. The back of the sign said, "Ask me about what happened". So I asked, and the homeless person told me that one week ago, he had been shopping at the mall, just before closing, and all of a sudden heard the voice that he recognized as the guy from the apartment upstairs, whom he'd never actually seen. He looked around and didn't see the guy anywhere. He did, however, see a little black cat, which beckoned him to follow. He followed the cat to the cafeteria where the cat, upset that people were only giving it milk (which it couldn't digest because it was lactose intolerant), started throwing the saucers at people and yelling "Got cow?" Not wanting to get hit by any food, I began to leave the mall. As soon as I got outside, I heard the voice of the guy from the apartment above mine again. I looked all around and discovered that the voice was coming from above me - up in the sky! I looked up and discovered that the guy wasn't really a guy, but was in fact a super-evolved sentient broccoli, with the evil intent to destroy the Earth! As the Earth was being destroyed, I ran and quickly sold my house, cars, and everything else in exchange for the world's supply of duct tape, which I used to repair the planet (of which I was very fond) and saved the day!

When e-small exchanging, the Ambush trade can be a saw inside your arsenal of exchanging. It is a Fibonacci trade, that isn’t truly the favourite, but includes a surprising volume of success. This trade set-up, which occurs frequently, take a moment and fitness to know, but learning it could put valuable ticks within the positive side inside the exchanging ledger.
A fast note on trades utilizing Fibonacci number is needed here. I’ve no thought that Fib figures hold any particular value in e-small exchanging, but enough people trust Fibonacci magic using this trade an online-based-based self-fulfilling conjecture. I trade products realistically work, no matter my own, personal, personal, personal beliefs. Since enough e-small traders have sufficient belief in Fibonacci exchanging, I’ll happily be a part of their fun.
There are many way of trade the Ambush trade, acquiring a few individuals believing the entire range during the day is needed. These traders plot the conventional Fibonacci figures within the usual manner, using only the whole day’s range their basis. Personally, I’ve discovered this exchanging methodology to acquire not just like mine I generally search around at different companies to uncover a considerable relocate the day’s exchanging and apply Fib retracements to a new individual move. I’ve needed straight into several discussions with regards to this subject some pro some negative but additionally personally, recognizing a substantial move and exchanging the Ambush employing this move remains best.
Once I stated formerly, I generally visit a significant relocate the day’s exchanging action and apply some Fibonacci retracement immediately within the visit to conclude within the move. Basically I’m calculating the amount of retracement within the initial move. The place I’m interested may be the 50% retracement for your 61.2 volume of retracement. The place between both of these plots is known as the Ambush zone. I’d bring the quantity 50 isn’t a Fib number nonetheless it could get tossed for the mix for reasons I do not grasp.
Some aggressive traders instantly have a very exchange a gift level within the ambush zone say, at 50%. Personally, i avoid this process, once i generally consider target start to change directions before entering this trade. It becomes an odd trade for individuals who aren’t knowledgeable about observing this trade, because it appears you’re selecting any trade “unexpectedly” within the relatively strong retracement within the trend. But Fib traders are snug when using the Ambush trade and they’re waiting with persistence for that retracement coming within the Ambush zone. They’re doing something, and exchange the direction opposite the retracement combined with the initial trend. I am in a position to generally get 12 ticks by using this trade don’t switch it on, because the cost action frequently resumes for that retracement. This isn’t a trade to obtain greedy on, retain the ticks and obtain inside the initial indication of movement opposite the direction inside the trade.
To summarize, I’ve described the broadly used trade among experienced traders based on Fibonacci retracements. This trade is extremely consistent well, i search for it through the direction to every single day. Create eek every tick by using this trade, and exit inside the first indication of the trade moving upon your conditions.

Why programs that blend work-based learning and traditional academics might be the future of higher education.
Traditional academics or vocational training? It’s a question that’s been debated in higher education circles since what seems like the beginning of time.
But for Stephen M. Jordan, Ph.D., president of Metropolitan State University of Denver, the answer is simple: “A great education should give students both.”
Jordan cites the Swiss apprenticeship model as a pertinent example. Even though college is free in Switzerland, nearly 70 percent of young people in the country opt into the Vocational Education and Training system, which puts them to work three days a week. The other two days are spent in the classroom. Companies from a wide variety of industries employ these paid apprentices, including the business, information technology and health care sectors, as well as traditional trades and crafts.
Last winter, Jordan had an opportunity to see the Swiss model in action, when he joined Gov. John Hickenlooper and other Colorado leaders on a trip to learn about the VET program.
“The companies see apprenticeships as an investment in the future,” said Jordan. “They aren’t just teaching the students skills; they’re grooming the next generation of leaders. These programs are similar to those we’ve developed and are developing at MSU Denver, and I think higher education as a whole is moving in this direction. We’re aiming to lead the way.”
And if that isn’t impressive enough in its own right, here’s something more: Solis is doing that work as part of her undergraduate education at MSU Denver.
The electrical engineering technology major is one of six students participating in a co-op program at Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company this year.
“It is amazing to think that a little piece of me will be in space,” said Solis of the project. “The experience has taught me so much already and it has pushed me to go above and beyond what I even expected of myself.”
The co-op program is a collaboration between MSU Denver and Lockheed Martin. Students take a slightly decreased course load, so they can focus on the work experience for two full semesters. They work 20 to 25 hours each week in areas such as 3-D printing, electronics, composite development and even spacecraft testing. More intensive than a traditional internship, the program places students in roles with greater responsibility and pays well.
Solis is part of the second cohort of students to participate in the program, the 2016-17 class. The inaugural group of seven students began their training in September 2015. Of that initial group, six continue to work at Lockheed Martin, five in a full-time capacity. Two students from the second cohort graduated in December and were offered full-time jobs.
For Mark Yoss, production principal at Lockheed Martin, the program is accomplishing its primary goal.
“We are creating a workforce pipeline, getting talented people to come and work for our company,” he said. “And the students are making significant contributions to our mission while they’re still in school. By those measures, the partnership has been a real success.”
At a time when finding talented and diverse employees has been a challenge for aerospace and advanced manufacturing companies across Colorado, the co-op program has helped meet a real need.
As for Solis, she hopes to stay on with Lockheed Martin when she graduates in 2017. But for now, she has plenty on her plate: simple stuff, like designing a circuit board for a valve driver on a military satellite.
They place the pipes in our homes and install the HVAC systems that keep us comfortable at work. Yet because their handiwork often goes unseen, craft workers don’t always get recognized for their contributions.
A new program aims to change that, to give tradespeople credit for the work they do – college credit.
The first-of-its-kind program was developed by MSU Denver and RK, a regional leader in mechanical contracting and custom manufacturing, and was intended to help RK employees move into leadership roles in their respective fields. Trade workers who have completed a Department of Labor-certified apprenticeship and received their journeymen’s license are eligible for a 30-credit-hour block that they can apply toward a bachelor’s degree in construction project management at MSU Denver.
“It’s a great opportunity for skilled trade workers who never thought they’d need to go to college,” said Sandra Haynes, Ph.D., deputy provost at MSU Denver. “They might have gone to work right out of high school, and love what they do, but found out later that in order to move up, they would need a bachelor’s degree. This partnership gives them a springboard to the next step in their careers.”
The program will make it convenient for craft workers to take that step. The additional classes needed to earn a degree will be offered in flexible formats, even possibly on site at one of RK’s two metro Denver facilities. Students will move through coursework together in a supportive learning environment, and may even be given time off during the workday to take classes.
Another major advantage of the program is that students won’t need to stop working full time to take classes, which means they can pay as they go without needing to give up their livelihood or incur debt.
Jon Kinning, the chief operating officer and executive vice president of RK, helped develop the program. He sees it as meeting a need for both his employees and the company.
“In an industry with significant workforce shortages, this program will help us grow our own middle-skilled workers into management roles,” he said. “It could also help show young people who are interested in the trades that this is a viable career path that provides both hands-on skills and upward mobility.”
The curriculum for the CPM degree has been approved and classes are already available, though leaders of both institutions expect the program to ramp up in the fall 2017 semester. The hope is to put together an inaugural class of 15 to 20 students from RK. If successful, the program could be replicated with other companies. It is currently open to any individual skilled trade worker who meets application requirements.
For Robert Park, Ph.D., the director of MSU Denver’s Advanced Manufacturing Sciences Institute, the program sends a clear message to the community.
“These craft workers spend four years as apprentices. That’s as long as it takes to get a traditional undergraduate degree. We want to make sure they know that MSU Denver recognizes the value of those apprenticeships and the skills that they bring to the table.”
When MSU Denver leaders put together plans for a new Aerospace and Engineering Sciences Building, they designated the top level as a “growth floor.”
The idea was to find an aerospace or advanced manufacturing company that would set up operations there, providing real-world learning experiences to students in the form of exposure and internships.
The University signed an agreement with York Space Systems, which will bring the company’s new manufacturing facility and mission operations center to the Auraria Campus in time for the AES Building’s 2017 opening.
The facility will house York’s full engineering and design team, production facility, as well as the center, which will operate spacecraft on-orbit, in real-time. In addition to supporting York’s premier mission, the Harbinger Mission, the factory will enable production capability for up to 150-200 satellites per year.
“York Space Systems believes in the potential for Colorado to become a prominent hub for aerospace innovation and our work with MSU Denver presents a unique opportunity to support the training, education and employment of future industry leaders,” said Dirk Wallinger, CEO and co-founder of York. “The public-private partnership agreement with the University will not only further the growth trajectory for the community, but also propel Colorado into the future of aerospace engineering and technology.”
Through the partnership with York, aerospace and advanced manufacturing students from MSU Denver will have the opportunity to collaborate on projects and access internship opportunities, part-time employment and work-study programs to help launch their careers in the aerospace industry.
"It is truly exciting to imagine our students working alongside York's engineers on the design and construction of satellites that'll be launched into space and, on top of that, having them participate in the on-orbit control of the satellites they helped build,” said Park. “And this will all be happening right on campus."

Learn stripping, staining, painting and reupholstering basics to make bargain-basement furniture worthy of center stage at home
Staining, stripping and whitewashing, oh my! If you want to revamp a well-loved old piece of furniture but are not sure where to begin, this guide is for you. Here you’ll find tips for when to use what technique, along with some valuable how-to advice.
1. Strip old painted finishes. This is not an easy task and definitely is not wise for anyone with respiratory issues to undertake — but aside from those caveats, stripping your own old furniture can save money and produce good results.
Tools of the trade: Chemical stripper (note that the faster-acting strippers are also the most toxic), solvent respirator with new filters, safety goggles, chemical-resistant gloves, workapron, brushes, scrapers and steel wool.
How-to: Move the piece to an outdoor location or well-ventilated garage and remove any hardware. It is essential to protect yourself from the caustic fumes of a chemical stripper (see the list of safety gear above).
After you brush on the stripper, the paint should start to bubble up. Use a scraper or steel wool to remove the layers of old paint. Afterward, be sure to give the piece a coat of mineral spirits or denatured alcohol to remove traces of the stripper.
2. Stain wood tables and chairs. If you have an old solid wood piece of furniture, consider staining rather than painting it to show off the wood grain. The pine dining table shown here was a Craigslist find — it was originally orange, and the homeowners stripped it and gave it a lovely dark finish.
Tools of the trade: Sandpaper, wood conditioner, rubber or nitrile gloves, wood stain, soft cloth and polyurethane varnish.
How-to: Starting with stripped wood, smooth the piece with sandpaper and vacuum or rub away all dust. Applying wood conditioner will help the finish go on more evenly.
Rub on the wood stain evenly with a soft cloth (you may want to use multiple coats) and finish with a coat of polyurethane.
3. Reupholster an antique. Taking on an upholstery project takes some serious DIY skills — but if you are patient and willing to learn, it can be done. Andrea Mihalik of the reupholstery biz Wild Chairy learned her craft by reading an upholstery book and recommends that potential DIYers do the same.
Tips: Take photos at every step as you take apart your chair; save the original fabric pieces to use as a pattern.
When to see a pro: When your piece has structural issues or uncomfortable springs. A pro can completely rebuild your chair … not something the average person should try at home.
4. Whitewashing, liming and pickling. You can achieve a faded, whitewashed look using a number of methods. What they all have in common is that they lighten wood while still allowing the grain to show through.
Tools of the trade: Brass or copper brush or wool, sandpaper, liming wax, liming solution or primer, soft rags and clear wax or clear polyurethane.
To lighten the wood, you can use liming wax, liming wash or a solution of primer and water, working it in with a rag. If you’re using wax, remove excess wax with fine steel wool and seal the surface with clear wax. If you’re using primer or liming solution, wipe off the excess with a rag. Once the piece is dry, seal it with a coat of polyurethane.
6. Latex and oil paints. First, which to choose? Latex paints have the distinct advantage of being water soluble, which means cleanup is as easy as dunking your tools in a bucket of water.
Oil-based paint requires taking more safety precautions: The fumes mean it is best to work outdoors; harsh chemical solvents are needed for cleanup; and you must bring all leftovers to a hazardous waste center. The advantages of oil-based paints are better coverage and, some say, richer colors.
Tools of the trade: Drop cloths, sandpaper, mini foam rollers, painter’s tape, primer, latex or oil paint, and solvent for oil paint.
How-to: Remove all drawers and hardware, and set the piece up on bricks or wood blocks on top of a drop cloth. Sand lightly and wipe away dust. Tape off the edges of the drawers as needed with painter’s tape. Give the piece a coat of primer and let it dry.
For painting, use a small roller to get a smooth application without brush lines. Start at the top and work your way down; let the paint dry completely between coats.
7. Spray paint. For outdoor furniture, nothing beats a few coats of spray paint. Choose a formula made for outdoor furniture, and it will stand up well to the elements.
How-to: Thoroughly clean the furniture, scrubbing off scuffs and rust, and let it dry completely. Wear rubber gloves and a painter’s mask while spray painting. Working outdoors on a drop cloth, spray the furniture with even strokes. Several light coats will provide even coverage without too many drips.
8. Re-cover a seat cushion. Unlike a full reupholstery job, re-covering a seat cushion is a relatively simple and satisfying project.
How-to: Unscrew the seat cushion from the chair. Remove the old fabric and use it as a template to cut new fabric. If the batting or foam cushion is very worn, replace it. Wrap the new fabric over the seat and use a staple gun to attach it. Screw the seat back in place.

Plain cauliflower rice makes an amazing substitute for regular rice when serving it with curries, stir fries, and in meal bowls. But if you’re looking for a substitute for rice as a side dish—a la Rice-A-Roni (the San Francisco treat!)—it’s a little bit lacking.
Solution? Spice up that cauliflower rice! This trio of keto cauliflower rice recipes has something for everyone—and Indian-inspired rice with garam masala and turmeric, Lemon & Herb cauliflower rice that’s perfect for serving with your favorite protein, and Spanish cauliflower rice for an epic burrito meal bowl.
While some cauliflower rice recipes call for steaming or microwaving the cauliflower, I’ve found that it’s worth it to get out a big skillet and make it on the stovetop with ghee or oil. The result is cauliflower rice that’s lightly browned and a little bit nutty—totally perfect.
These cauli rice recipes are from Martina Slajerova’s latest cookbook Keto Slow Cooker & One-Pot Meals. If you’re into keto or low carb, you undoubtedly know Martina from her amazing blog, KetoDiet, and apps. I’ve been a fan of her food blog for some time, and I knew her cookbook wouldn’t disappoint—and it didn’t! It’s full of simple one-pot dinners that the entire family will love. I made the Halloumi Jalfrezi last week with the Masala Cauliflower Rice and it was a huge hit; the Greek Briam, Ratatouille Soup, and Broccoli & Mushroom Alfredo Casserole are all on my list to make soon.
Skip the starchy sides and make keto-friendly (and vitamin-C-rich) cauliflower rice instead: it’s the perfect partner for slow-cooked meat and flavorful sauces. Just add your favorite spices and you’re good to go!
Grease a large saucepan with ghee and add all the aromatics for the preferred cauli-rice recipe: Masala, Lemon & Herb, or Spanish.
Purchase Martina Slajerova’s Keto Slow Cooker & One-Pot Meals: Over 100 Simple & Delicious, Low-Carb, Paleo and Primal Recipes for Weight Loss and Better Health and preorder her upcoming book, The Beginner’s KetoDiet Cookbook, on Amazon or wherever books are sold.

ways to make extra money - I will be showing you different ways to make money and how to get money fast.
As noted a few times recently, I’ve cycled over into “demo mode” and have been working on… well, something that I’ll be keeping quiet about for a little while yet until it properly gets past that stage where it could be changed or indeed completely reinvented on a whim. Generally speaking though, my intention is to have something ready for X’2018 in early November – assuming we have a representative to take it along – and have a cluster of prototype routines along with some other ideas I’ve been meaning to try and a folder of logos because everybody loves logos… right?
Things have been going slowly but surely so far – today alone I somehow managed to metaphorically paint myself into a corner on two different occasions with what should’ve been relatively simple code, either choosing a less than sensible place to store things or simply running out of memory altogether – and, because it’s been a painfully long time since I worked on anything that wasn’t a onefiler, last week saw me sitting down and trying to get my head around cruncher and loader integration with some of the more recent iterations of popular tools with very little joy… at least until I discovered lft’s Spindle that is.
Spindle is, in essence, a back engine for demos which deals with loading and decompressing of data to the point where the user doesn’t need to be involved; no fighting assemblers to build loader or decruncher code, no messing around with building disk images of data, just document the files being used and the order they’re needed via a script file which is then run through Spindle to automagically get a working disk image out the far end. There are caveats of course – a couple of places in memory have to be avoided, something else I bumped into today – but having to do things just a teensy bit differently is worth it for the results.
Main project aside, there’s also been a little time spent generally doodling both with graphics and ideas for effects and a couple of forays onto other platforms; something might come of the latter if they survive testing on real hardware – in both cases the code was for a platform I don’t actually own right now, so that’s something of an issue – but at the very least it was all good practice.

I can be a driver and a guide at the same time, I can help you with all the details of your trip to Pamir of Tajikistan or to Kyrgyzstan.
Let me tell you this, Murgab is located comfortably right in the middle of Dushanbe and Bishkek so it is very easy for me to take you either from Bishkek or Dushanbe.
I can organize tours both in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan and being a native of Murgab I speak both languages Kyrgyz and Tajik. Using many years of experience, I can help you with other things such as trekking, horseriding, Yak riding and folk shows as well, just let me know.
Your trip to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan is all about enjoying your time and being carefree with me. See you!
Shamil was a really great driver and guide that expertly facilitated our 8 day Pamir highway trip. We are a group of 4 young women from Canada who travelled from Osh to Dushanbe. Shamil was very attentive the entire time to our needs and wants, going out of his way to ensure we felt safe and comfortable and that we were able to see all the highlights of the Pamir Highway. He booked all of our accommodation and arranged all of our food in addition to arranging a day of hiking. All of the accommodations and food were excellent, and he clearly had strong connections and close relationships with people in each village we visited. He was good humoured and kind and took opportunities to educate us on the history of the region. He has been working in the industry for over 12 years and his knowledge and high skill level were evident! He was also a safe and careful driver, allowing us to never feel like we were rushing or unsafe on the road. If you are looking for a kind, generous and knowledgeable host for the Pamir Highway experience, I can’t recommend Shamil enough!
Shamil is a very good driver and guide. He can speak al the central asian languages so it's very easy for him to drive throw all the countries. He took us in very nice and comfortable accommodations. He is a skilled mechanic as well and he can fix any car problem. We did a 12 days tour from Dushanbe to Bishkek: recommended!
Shamil took us on a 7N/8D roadtrip through the Pamir and Wakhan corridor. He was communicative throughout the organizing phase, and the itinerary he offered us showcased the best parts of the region, with many opportunities to meet locals and have a wonderfully immersive cultural experience. He was flexible when we wanted to stop for a photo or rest break, he chose excellent accommodations, he is extremely knowledgeable with fixing cars (he helped numerous people along the way), and he was excellent at navigating the rough Pamir roads. Our vehicle was clean each morning when we got in, with a new bottle of water in our cup holder. I highly recommend Shamil.
Shamil was the best tour guide we could have ever hoped for, very helpful and was always making sure we were ok. He went above and beyond. The home stays were great he chose and we even enjoyed a meal at his home in Murghab. His driving skills were great and handled the rough roads perfectly.
The best driver in the Pamir. He knows the best routes off-road and all the place with interesting things to see. I hope to see you again friend!!!

Once the bank information is entered, in ACH Universal, click on the QuickBooks Integration (Pro, Premiere, Enterprise) icon.
All non-QuickBooks users will be importing an Excel or CSV file with the required data. From the main screen, you will click on 'Import Transactions', select your import file, and map the headers of each column during the initial import (see below). To map the columns, simply click on the column and select the appropriate header from the dropdown. To create a basic ACH file you only need to map the 'Name', 'Amount', 'ABA Number', and 'Bank Account Number'. If you are interested in sending remittance emails, you will include and map the 'Email Address' column as well.
Note: Disbursement amounts that are shown as positive numbers must be mapped as "Amount Reverse Sign".
Optional: ACH Universal has built-in email functionality so automatic emails can be sent to ACH recipients notifying them of the transaction details. This feature is available with the Corporate or Processor edition license. This link explains how to set up the email feature: http://treasurysoftware.com/Help7ACH/email_setup.html

Chris Eubank Jr. honoured his father at a photo shoot before Saturday’s Ali Trophy quarter-final clash with Avni Yildirim at the Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle in Stuttgart, Germany.
“My father was one of the most dazzling figures in boxing in his era and one of the most successful,” said Eubank Jr. about his legendary father, two-weight champion Chris Eubank Sr.
One of the most electrifying moments came in May 1995, when Chris Eubank Sr. entered the arena on a Harley-Davidson before fighting Steve Collins.
“Boxing is not only a sport, but also a show, and I will try to be as good as my father in both matters.”
“It was the first defeat of my father. That’s why I chose another Harley-Davidson for the photo shoot.”
Instead of a ‘1975 Shovelhead’, Junior chose a ‘2018 Fat Boy’ – the successor model of the famous motorcycle from the Terminator-movies.
“I am the next generation, the future of boxing. On Saturday I will terminate Yildirim, the so-called Turkish Rambo,” said Eubank Jr. and promised:
“Before I win the ‘Ali Trophy’ in May next year, I’ll enter an arena on a Harley just like my father!”
Tickets for the hotly anticipated fight October 7 at the Hanns-Martin-Schleyer Halle are available at StubHub.de, eventim.de and easyticket.de.

Ranbir Kapoor and Sanjay Dutt's upcoming film Shamshera directed by Karan Malhotra might have found its female lead in Vaani Kapoor. The makers finally made an announcement on Monday, May 14, about Vaani Kapoor bagging another big film.
Karan Malhotra, director of Shamshera, says, “Vaani plays Ranbir’s love interest in the film and is a very important collaborator in his character’s journey. Her character graph is interlinked to the plot of the filmmaking her a crucial catalyst in our hero’s rebellious mission.”
He adds, “Vaani is a perfect fit for the role. She is a fine actor, a fabulous dancer, and a gorgeous Hindi film heroine. We wanted someone absolutely fresh to wow audiences on the big screen and she beautifully fits that brief.”
Talking about the movie, Ranbir Kapoor earlier said, “Shamshera is exactly the film I was looking for. While growing up watching Hindi commercial cinema, I had an image of what a film hero should be doing. Shamshera allows me to do everything that I had imagined and it’s a very exciting project for me. Karan is going to take me completely out of my comfort zone and I’m looking forward to this challenge.”

My father has been working in the high end tradeshow business for the past thirty years. His company Exhibit Systems Inc. has been designing and producing booths for numerous tradeshows and conventions throughout the world.
After years of experience, he has become very knowledgeable on the geometry and mathematics incorporated in his profession. One particular case in which geometry skills come in handy is determining the length of a photograph presented in a kiosk. There are two cases: one in which the dimensions of the photograph are known, and what needs to be determined are the lengths of the framework needed to construct the kiosk, and the other in which the measurements of the frame is known, and the dimension of the photograph need to be determined.
The framework of each kiosk is essentially the same. There are four radius bars connecting at a center post. There are four congruent arc frames that encase four photographs of the same size. Then, there are four posts situated equidistant from each other along the perimeter of the kiosk, and each is attached to the center post by a radius bars. Lastly, there are two different types of posts: round and square. Either a kiosk uses all round posts or all square posts.
The dimensions of the kiosk vary from booth to booth depending on the taste and preferences of the company and product being shown.
Given the dimensions of the photograph, the constructor of the kiosk is mainly focused on determining the length of the photograph. The length of the photograph helps to determine the lengths and measurements of the arcs and rods used in the circular framework of the kiosk. The following spreadsheet can help determine the lengths of the pieces of metal used in a kiosk with square posts.
o The photograph reaches each square post at the midpoint of the edge. Therefore, each photograph hits the midpoint of an edge of each square post along the perimeter of the kiosk. Since the square post measures 1.26 in. x 1.26 in., the square post must then extend inwards to the center post. Similarly, the center post extends outward toward each square post along the perimeter.
o Each arc frame essentially measures 1.26 inches less than the actual measurement of ¼ of the perimeter.
o Since each arc frame consists of two concentric frames (or circles), the inner frame will have a shorter arc length than the outer frame.
o The inner frame meets the square post at inches from the inner corner of the square post. Therefore, the radius of the inner concentric circle (the distance from the edge of the inner arc frame surrounding the photograph to the center of the kiosk) is 0.03125 inches less than the radius of the circle created by the photograph.
o The arc frame has a width of 0.591 inches, the photograph lies directly in between the two frames composing the arc. Therefore, inches lie between the photograph and the outer arc of the outer frame edge. So the radius of the outer concentric circle will be 0.2955 inches more than the radius of the circle created by the photograph.
Given the length of a photograph, how can someone determine the lengths of the metal pieces needed to construct the kiosk so that the photographs will fit perfectly. In other words, we need to find the measurements at which to cut the rods and arc frames such that the least amount of material is used.
Each photograph is 48in long. The perimeter of the circle created by the photographs is found below; keep in mind the inclusion of the four square posts.
When the arc frame is 0.591in thick, to find the measurement of the arc length of the inner concentric frame:
The following spread sheet application will allow one to easily find the length of each radius rod, the arc length of the inner arc frame, and the arc length of the outer arc frame for creating a circular kiosk with square posts.
The constructor of the kiosk also has the choice of using round posts in the perimeter of the kiosk.
The photograph bisects an edge of the round post. Since the diameter of the round post above is 1.791 inches. The round post extends inches inward and 0.8955 inches outward from the original radius measurement of the circle created by the photograph.
Each arc frame essentially measures 1.791 inches less than the actual measurement of ¼ of the perimeter.
Since each arc frame consists of two concentric frames (or circles), the inner frame will have a shorter arc length than the outer frame.
The inner frame meets the square post at inches from the center of the round post. Therefore, the radius of the inner concentric circle (the distance from the edge of the inner arc frame surrounding the photograph to the center of the kiosk) is 0.03125 inches less than the radius of the circle created by the photograph.
The arc frame has a width of 0.591 inches, the photograph lies directly in between the two frames composing the arc. Therefore, inches lie between the photograph and the outer arc of the outer frame edge. So the radius of the outer concentric circle will be 0.2955 inches more than the radius of the circle created by the photograph.
We will now consider the same problem stated before, except this time the constructor has decided to use round posts instead of square posts.
Each photograph is 48in long. The perimeter of the circle created by the photographs is found below; keep in mind the inclusion of the four round posts.
The arc length of the inner frame surrounding the photograph is approximately 47.95 inches long. (Note that this is the same length as using a square post).
The arc length of the outer frame surrounding the photograph is approximately 48.46 inches long. (Note that this is the same length as using a square post).
The following spread sheet application will allow one to easily find the length of each radius rod, the arc length of the inner arc frame, and the arc length of the outer arc frame for creating a circular kiosk with round posts.
The two spreadsheet applications will aid constructors in determining the lengths of the frames used in constructing a four photograph kiosk. The spreadsheet allows constructors to easily enter the dimensions and lengths of the posts and photograph in order to find the necessary lengths at which to cut radius rods and arc frames.

I have been reading II Corinthians recently, and I was sitting in the quiet of the morning today, just me and my coffee (and the sounds of kids waking up in their rooms! Help! My time-bomb is ticking!), I landed on chapter 4 verse 12. Paul has been describing to the Corinthians the principle of carrying around Christ's death in his body in order that through death, the life of Christ may be revealed to those around him. In other words, as Paul dies to the things Jesus died to set him free from, Christ's life becomes that much more evident in his own.
As I heard the morning sounds of the kids, it struck me that the same principle can be applied to parenting. II Cor 4:12 says, "So then, death is at work in us but life is at work in you." As I parent my kids, wonderful though they are, I am constantly in a place of choice. I can react naturally to their childish ways and disobedience, and become impatient and frustrated when they interrupt my plans. Or I can, as Paul writes, "... carry around in our bodies the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body." As I parent, I can also choose to react unnaturally (i.e against my instincts and human nature) when my children test me, choose to die to the things Jesus died to free me from, and thereby reveal the life of Christ in me. Death is at work in me (and how painful and unpleasant it can be to die!), but as a result life is at work in my kids.
Surely this is a worthy reason to die to myself over and over again - my little deaths are sowing seeds of life in my children! Galatians describes to us the fruits of the Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Because these fruits come not from our own hearts but from God's Spirit dwelling in us, they are unnatural and require a death to self. But when I die to my impatience, or my un-gentle manner, or my lack of self-control, the Spirit of life is at work - not only in me, but also in my little stewards. So then, death is at work in me, but life is at work in them. And how I long to bring them life!
(On a side note, I was also reading from John Baillie's 'A Diary of Readings' this morning, in which he included the following by Lady Julian of Norwich. She describes the futility of Satan's attempts to derail the believer who takes to heart that living is Christ and dying is gain - who believes that difficulties in life are to be counted as joyful opportunities to grow more Christlike: "And however sore he [the Devil] travails, and however continually, yet he sees that all chosen souls escape him worshipfully; and that is all his sorrow. For all that God suffers him to do turns us to joy, and him to pain and shame."
So, when I die to myself, whether in my dealings with my children or some other area of life, the result is two-fold. First, I am sowing life in my children. And second, I am rendering inert the attempts of the enemy to work in my heart, by choosing to live worshipfully and allowing the Spirit to be alive in my actions. Though the dying itself is often almost prohibitively difficult, the good of the results, in my opinion, far outweighs the difficulty!)
Welcome to an oft-neglected space where I chronicle parts of our life! I am a wife, a mother to the three most awesome kids on earth, a child of the King, a toddler wrangler and homeschool teacher, an RN, a missionary, and an introvert who loves socialising - sometimes, with a small number of people at a time!
In my last post, I wrote that one of my hopes and prayers as we returned to PNG this spring was that our roots would be put down deeply enough that in times of difficulty or stress, we would be able to bend and flex without breaking. Well, this last week sure tested that idea!!
Like most of America's kids, ours recently started their first week back at school. Aren't they just adorbs :D
Actually, we began with a gentle half-week two weeks ago, and this last week was the real deal. I knew in the weeks leading up to our first day, as I prepped our material, that this year would be different than last. We are doing second grade and kindergarten this year, and while Levi's days are still short, they are definitely more structured and involved than during Pre-K. I estimated that Anna would still be able to get all her material covered by lunch time, but assumed that second grade would also require more of us than first. In preparation, I made a list of all the classes each child would be taking, figured out which would involve hands-on help from me and which could be done independently, and which classes could be shared. Based on that, I then created a daily schedule in which I planned for one child's independent work to be completed while I worked one-on-one with the other, and vice versa. Interspersed were times of shared learning (like Bible, History and read-aloud time), and recess at their usual snack time. I rearranged furniture in our house to create an individual space for each of the kids to have a desk area, with bookshelf space nearby for their books, rather than doing everything at the kitchen table and having a massive clean-up mission before lunch every day, like we did last year.
In all my planning, ignoring the nagging voice in my subconscious, I just assumed Lucy would be cool with this new routine. Like Levi was when I started homeschooling Anna. (I mean, seriously. The kid would just sit with us at the table when he was two years old and listen or colour until he got bored, and then hop down and play by himself until we were done. Apparently this is not typical toddler behaviour that you should count on being repeated by successive siblings???)
Lucy, unlike either of her big sibs, is not a laid-back child. I hesitate to use the words strong and willed, mostly out of blind panic, but that is definitely the personality type she leans towards! (She is also pee-your-pants hilarious, approaches life with bright eyes and excited curiosity, showers me with spontaneous affection, and has enough personality to totally fill our very high-ceilinged home; her little package definitely includes a lot of perks too!)
She never leaves you in the dark regarding her opinion. Like if she hates the song you're whistling? You won't be whistling for long.
But even as a baby, for a long time she resisted a day-time routine in a way neither Anna nor Levi did, was fussy with pretty much anyone who wasn't me from the time she could distinguish different faces (ask anyone who lives with us at Kudjip whether I am exaggerating!), and just required more of me than the other two ever did. I'm regularly grateful that I've had a couple run-throughs of this parenting thing already and have some perspective I definitely did not possess as a first time parent ... but still, she's stretched and challenged me (*usually* with good outcomes!) much more than I ever have been before as a mom. God is certainly teaching me that it's possible and necessary to deeply love one's child even while their actions are making you feel like a crazy person!
(As a side note, I recently read an account of one mom's discovery, on pausing homeschooling to search for her quiet toddler, that the kid had methodically covered themselves, the carpet and the oversized rocking horse with Desitin and then a generous sprinkling of baby powder. To which her optimist friend commented, "Well, at least it wasn't poop!!" -- I can now recount a similar quiet-toddler story, without that final repartee. Please be truly horrified for me and pray earnestly on my behalf that it never, NEVER happens again. And maybe be glad not to have a photo at this point.)
So, to return to our first week of school, Friday turned out to be the day none of the stars in my life aligned. I don't think any of them were even in the same hemisphere of sky. My amazing friend Lena who comes on Friday mornings to help me clean the house was unable to this week (which she did, in fairness, warn me may be the case). I was still physically tired from doing a heavy town trip/ grocery shop the previous day, after which I hadn't slept well at all. Lucy was in fine toddler form and got sent to her room to throw a blood-boiling fit in solitude at least half a dozen times between 8:30 and 11:30, causing significant interruptions to the flow of our school day each time. And it turns out this mama is just unable to be a kindergarten teacher, second grade teacher, daycare provider/ toddler disciplinarian, cook/cleaner/laundromat staff-person, and mother all at the same time on a poor night of sleep. You are as shocked as I was on discovering this, I'm pretty sure.
I told Mark at the end of the day that there was just no way I was going to be able to do this for an entire year, and he had some super helpful ideas that I am planning to implement over the next couple of weeks. Like getting the bulk of Anna's school done during Lucy's naptime, when I normally have the big kids just rest and/or read in their room. (I'll be honest -- giving up my sanity-recovering alone time after lunch was a hard sell. But after our day on Friday was absolutely the perfect time to pitch it to me!) I did an hour or two of homeschool-mom-blog research (HOW do moms who homeschool more kids than I even HAVE, and also have toddlers and babies hanging out in the background, have time to write these articles that the rest of us find so helpful??) and pooled some ideas. I'm now armed with a good page and a half of things Anna or Levi can do to help keep Lucy busy while I'm working with the other child, a basket of 'Lucy school' baggies that she can choose from to play with by herself, a more realistic timetable for the day, and the paradigm shift that school can no longer simply happen without taking the toddler into account!
I'm praying it's enough ... but if not, we will just keep bending until we find something that works.
I had some pumpkin puree left over and I'd been trying to figure out what to do with it. So the other morning I decided I'd try making pumpkin waffles for breakfast. I didn't have a recipe so I just made it up as I went along, therefore I wasn't exactly sure how or if they'd turn out to be any good. I figured if they were a flop I'd just feed them to our chickens!
I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome of these waffles. Just a subtle pumpkin flavor and with the syrup they were just delicious. My husband really liked them, even though before I started he said he didn't think it sounded like a good idea! Just goes to show that everything is worth a try! I only happen to own a Belgian waffle maker, even though I prefer regular size waffles (not sure how that happened). I am hoping to get a regular waffle maker someday, but until then I can only verify that these are yummy in the Belgian waffle form. However, I'm pretty confident the recipe would work with a regular size waffle maker also.
Preheat waffle maker. Pour the milk into a medium sized bowl and add the vinegar. Let the mixture stand for 5 minutes then add the eggs, pumpkin, vanilla and melted butter and whisk to combine. In a large bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir just until fully combined. Cook the waffles according to your waffle maker's instructions.
This article is very useful, thank you for sharing. And allow me to share articles too, it's about health and treatment. God willing it will be useful for us all. Thank you :)
Welcome! My name is Joy (aka Little B), and I've started this website as a way to chronicle all of our family's favorite recipes. I live in northern Vermont with my husband and son. Cooking has become a passion of mine and I strive to perfect the recipes I love and to further expand my knowledge and love of food. When I had my son I became painfully aware that most prepared foods sold in grocery stores for children are full of fat and additives and are mostly processed. This is not what I wanted for my son, so I began my quest to make him good, old fashion homemade meals. It has been a long journey of food discovery for me, and my passion to provide nutritious homemade food for my family has grown in ways I never would have thought possible 13 years ago! I am obsessed with making all I can from scratch. As a family, we have decided to try to be as self-sufficient as possible...well, we are working towards that anyway! So, join me in my journey of food discovery and browse through our family's favorite recipes. Enjoy! © Little B Cooks. All images & content are copyright protected.

The "Green Heart—Architecture for Tropical Cities" exhibition showcases the Marina One project by ingenhoven architects, which will open in the center of Singapore at the end of 2017. As an international role model for living and working, Marina One makes an innovative contribution to the discourse on mega-cities, especially in tropical regions, which, in the context of increasing population and climate hange, face enormous challenges. The high-density building complex with its mix of uses extends to over 400,000 square meters and, with its group of four high-rise buildings, defines the "Green Heart"—a public space extending over several stories. This three-dimensional green oasis reflects the diversity of tropical flora. Aedes presents diagrams and interviews with project participants, as well as a documentary film on the architecture. The central element of the exhibition is a spectacular five meter high space sculpture which brings to life the unique shape of the Marina One buildings.

The very first thing you should check is the power switch. There would be nothing more embarrassing than calling for emergency service and having to pay the technician big bucks just to flick on a switch. If the power switch is on, try turning it off, wait a few minutes and then turn it on again. If there is still no heat, then a service call may be required, but you should still check out all of the below before making that call.
You may have had a short power outage and did not realize it. Go to your electrical panel and check the breaker switch. If the breaker switch is in the off position, simply turn it up. If this still doesn’t kick on your boiler, then you may need to call for emergency service. However, continue to rule out any other issues before calling for emergency boiler service.
You should make sure that your thermostat has been set correctly. Check to ensure that the thermostat is on the HEAT setting or in AUTO position. Also, check the batteries inside the thermostat. You should keep an extra set of batteries on hand for a quick fix should the battery go dead. Try to kick on the boiler by raising the thermostat above room temperature. Most thermostats will click on within a few seconds, but you should wait at least 5 minutes. If the heat does not kick on within 5 minutes, you may have to call for service.
You may think you have enough fuel, but in very cold winter months, you can run out of your fuel supply quickly, especially if you aren’t on automatic delivery. If you have discovered you have run out of fuel oil, you should contact your fuel oil company to make a delivery. Don’t wait too long especially if the cold temperatures are at extreme levels. Not only will you be cold, but you can also run the risk of frozen pipes which can burst. Pipes that burst can be very expensive to replace and fix.
If you have a gas burner, the pilot light could have gone out. A defunct pilot light can happen if there is not enough oil or if it needs to be cleaned. Residue and corrosion can put your pilot light out of commission. Do not attempt to light the pilot on your own. At this point, you should make a boiler service call if you have replenished the oil and it still doesn’t work after re-starting it.
If all of the above fails, get in touch with a plumber east norwich who’s experienced with boilers and can diagnose the issue. If the problem is severe enough you may even need to contact an amityville plumber to help you install an entirely new boiler.
As we are retail stockists, selling from our Ledston shop as well as online, it makes it difficult for us to show a 'real-time' inventory of our wines and spirits online. As such, very occasionally, a wine may be out of stock that the website has allowed you to order.
To ensure a timely delivery, we are happy to substitute your order with a similar wine of equal or higher value and at no additional cost to you! If this is not an acceptable solution please advise us in the 'Special Instructions' at the checkout.
We endeavour to display accurate and current vintages on all our wines listed on the website; however, from time to time stocks of the vintage listed do become exhausted. If this is the case with your order we will always contact you to recommend another vintage of the same wine, if it is still available. If the vintage of a wine is important to you then please either 'ASK A QUESTION' or leave us a message in the 'Special Instructions' at checkout.
Any Single Bottle Orders are delivered using a Royal Mail Signed For Service and charged £6.00 per order.
Our independence allows us to operate freely within the UK courier network and provide bespoke delivery options for your convenience.
If you would like to place an order online and collect it from our store in Ledston this can be arranged for your convenience.
We recommend you contact us using 'ASK A QUESTION' to check that your order requirements are available and to arrange a convenient collection date and time.
Orders can be paid for on collection. We regret that third-party carriers (taxi drivers, chauffeurs or any individual who is not the customer) will not be permitted to collect pre-paid orders.

This is an urgent conversation we need to have, one that men and young men are hungry to have. This is the space to explore that discussion. Honest, real talk about us as men, and what exciting, inspiring ideas of being a man can look like for all of us.
Higher Unlearning is an online space to explore our climb up the Ladder of Manhood and what it means to be a man today. We hope to provide a brave space where we can discuss everyday situations and scenarios, ask those questions, share our worries and fears, and lean into our discomfort where the real learning and unlearning happens.
For close to ten years, Jeff is a speaker and facilitator who has delivered keynotes, talks and workshops for tens of thousands of people across North America from all walks of life (from organizations and community spaces, to grade school, high school, college and university students) on how society’s unattainable and harmful concepts of masculinity impact people of all genders. From Rogers Media, Vidyard, Canada Post, to numerous post-secondary spaces, Jeff has created space for people of all genders to explore being ‘the lesson in action’!
He has delivered two TEDx talks on Masculinity and men’s troubled pursuits of identity: Words Speak Louder Than Actions and The Ladder of Manhood. Jeff started Higher Unlearning as an online space to explore how ideas of gender and masculinity impact us in everyday life. Jeff previously worked at White Ribbon Campaign, organized dozens of gender/masculinity-related events, founded the annual ‘What Makes a Man’ Conference and was event director for the first TEDxWomen event in Toronto, Canada. He was named to Racism Free Ontario’s Top 100 Person of Colour list spotlighting anti-racism activists.
I absolutely LOVE this space! Not to mention the title Higher Unlearning is genius (I must say the movie ‘higher learning’ was a game changer for me in my youth too!) All the best to all of you and here’s to boundless, fluid identities;)

Flynn and Zuri, I'm glad to finally announce, are doing quite well. I've just been busy with finals, christmas break, working, and classes to post on here lately.
Zuri's litterbox training has been a constant struggle. She seems to poo about 80% in her litterbox, but very rarely pees in there. I tried giving her fleece and towels, but they just became saturated with urine within a day or two. Then I tried just leaving her with the bare plastic bottom of her cage, but she ended up sitting in puddles and cleaning it up was beginning to be a huge, disgusting chore at least three times a day. So, I finally gave up and got her a dog crate with a grate. The grate is SO much better than the ones in rabbit cages- much thicker and stronger coated wire, doesn't cut into her feet, comfortable for her to rest on, and since it's meant to support the weight of a dog up to 85 lbs, the flooring doesn't sag beneath her and she doesn't make any noise jumping around on it. In the slide out tray, I put puppy pads which soak up a lot of liquid and contain the odor. The whole setup is easier to clean and I feel much better not leaving her sitting in her own feces all day long.
Flynn has settled down. He doesn't freak out when Zuri is out, although he does ask to be groomed and she grooms him through the cage bars sometimes. He'll even flop and eat in her presence, whereas he used to pace frantically. He's once again my relaxed little guy.
I know baths aren't usually recommended for rabbits, but urine started to scald Zuri's bottom, belly, and feet so I have been bathing her every 10 days or so with baby shampoo and oatmeal, which my vet recommended, as well as putting on some neosporin. Tonight, I believe, will probably have been her last bath, since she is no longer able to come in contact with her urine.
Flynn was feeling a little jealous by all the Zuri pictures on here lately, so we had a little photoshoot today.
No, I'm not on the wrong side of the fence, either... and I'm not destroying anything under your bed.
Today is Zuri's third day home, and these days I just can't get the cage door open fast enough. I decided to let her run around my room for awhile again- about a half hour. Flynn has been running around frantically ever since. She's quite hilarious to watch- those ears just go everywhere, and she chins everything in sight. Meanwhile, I have yet to ever witness Flynn chinning ANYTHING. In fact, when Zuri touched noses with Flynn through the cage today, she even chinned HIM. :) Silly girl.
Flynn is running about my bedroom now. I'm still making sure he gets more time out than Zuri and an equal amount of attention, so he doesn't get jealous. He started jumping up on the bed today :D This is something he was NEVER able to do before, no matter how hard he wanted to come up. It's nice, because now I don't have to sit on the floor just to be with him- he keeps jumping on and off the bed periodically to visit and occasionally get petted. He's been leaving a little trail of poos in his cage whenever Zuri's out and if he goes out right after her. I just put them all back in his litterbox and he's back to his wonderful habits quickly.
Zuri's doing even better today. As you can see, she is still calm and unaffected by strange noises, smells, and movements.
Her poos are still soft, and she has the habit of peeing in whichever far corner I moved the litterbox from, so I put in a giant cat litterbox with a homemade grate, like Flynn's. The grate is made of 1/2"x1/2" coated wire, so that when she eats the poos fall safely through. The grate has also stopped her from eating her litter, which I was concerned about.
Since Zuri's poos have been a little firmer, I decided to let her run around the bedroom for awhile. And BOY, did she RUN! Baby binkies galore! She was hilarious to watch... she routinely tripped over herself and faceplanted :)
Flynn wouldn't stop looking at her, he paced back and forth and followed her every movement. At first, I intended to steer her away from his cage at all costs.
But Flynn just looked too pathetic, so I let them greet eachother through the bars. Flynn, surprisingly, was calm towards her and even presented his head to be groomed!
Zuri desperately needs her feet and bottom cleaned. They are caked with poop and urine, from wallowing in her soft poos, and it's quite disgusting. I'm just not quite sure how to do it without stressing her out. One idea I liked was soaking a towel with warm water and putting it in the kitchen sink, with about an inch of water, so she can walk around in it and let it soak in for awhile. Then, is there anything anyone recommends to scrub those little feetsies with? She doesn't mind being held and actually seems to like being close to me, but her feet simply gross me out!
We picked up Zuri today. She is one RELAXED bunny- not jumpy at all, which is a big difference from Flynn, who would be sent skittering away at the slightest movement or noise for weeks after we got him. She even flopped in her carrier and fell asleep on the way home while I was massaging her cheeks.
She has settled in quite nicely here. At first, she had some very sloppy, diarrhea poops. After filling her belly with hay and pellets, however, she is now leaving nice, round, mostly-solid poops. She seems a bit thin- her belly is a bit bloated/squishy, but you can feel her spine and ribs beneath her skin. I'm trying to remember if Flynn felt that way too? Well, either way, she has unlimited access to hay and pellets so hopefully she will put on a little weight soon! She's not really much smaller than Flynn- they are about the same length, but Flynn is much more filled in and muscular-looking. She's awfully scrawny, lanky, and awkward looking at the moment, especially with those crazy ears! I'm sure that will change in time.
Flynn is going absolutely crazy with the new baby in the house, but unfortunately they will not be allowed to meet each other for at least a month.
Zuri's cage and all of her things are all set up in my room. Her cage is above Flynn's, and he seemed very anxious about it so I brought him up there to investigate. Well, I had completely forgotten this peppermint puppy bone that had come as a free sample with some of the supplies I ordered online. Flynn was quick to find it and enjoyed it immensely.
Flynn's face after my boyfriend Eric burst into the room. They have mixed feelings about eachother. Sometimes they get along, sometimes they don't.
Zuri comes home tomorrow! We just got our first major snowfall of the year today, so hopefully the roads won't be terrible tomorrow. We have to drive 1 1/2 hours to pick her up.
A blog dedicated to two house bunnies. Flynn, a red mini rex, came into my life on July 21st, 2008. He is an energetic boy who loves to bonk me with his nose and jump into my lap, but he hates being picked up and only accepts petting on his terms. Zuri, a broken blue velveteen lop. She is only eight weeks old and just came home on November 25th, 2008. We are still learning about her, but she seems like a laid-back and confident girl!
I am a college student who is also working two jobs... so it is amazing that I have time to blog! This blog is dedicated to my red mini rex bunny, named Flynn, who was born on June 1st and came into my life on July 21st. :) He is the little velvety man in my life.

If something goes wrong, it is by definition always Alan's fault. It is the responsibility of all players to remind Alan of this. If you do not know Alan, you should blame Musto.
Just a quick explanation of this rule. The highest level resistance player in my local area is Alan, and we've had a running gag for years that it is always, by definition Alan's fault whenever things go wrong. Documenting local rules like this was the motivation for developing this site. Please feel free to vote this rule up :-)
Doesn't this rule need to include the locality it applies to? Where is the border between #blamemusto territory and Alan's fault territory?
@KevinC - Good question, with no easy answer. I do plan to extend the site to allow regional rule sets which makes sure Musto and Steve (suggested from g+) get their due blame. I think a lot of local rules like "Blame Alan" are getting missed.

We're a small team juggling a lot of projects. There's not always much time to answer questions (particularly those not directly related to the products we build and support) or to give thoughtful feedback on projects that people bring to us.
But we want to be accessible, approachable and create an opportunity for INN members (and members of the journalism and tech community at large) to ask us about any tech-related issues they may have or to get feedback on their projects.
We also frequently hear from designers and developers at member organizations that it's hard to get feedback on the work they do because they're often the only person at their organization who does the sort of work they do.
So we want to set aside some dedicated time every week to answer questions, talk through ideas and have an open design/code review.
Anyone can sign up for a 20-minute block to meet with our entire team and get feedback on tech-related issues you might be facing (new project ideas, critique of works in progress, general tech/strategy/design questions, etc.). We know that sometimes 20 minutes will not be enough, so you can sign up for a longer block of time if you clear it with us in advance.
INN members will get priority but, if space is available, we'll open the signups to outside organizations/individuals. If we're already booked, you can put yourself on the waitlist and we'll let you know if a spot becomes available. If there are open slots in the schedule we'll plan to do a design or code review for one of our projects so you can see how we handle this sort of feedback and hopefully take some ideas back to your organization.
Since we're a remote team, these will be Zoom.us video calls. The persistent link for this call is right here. We used Google Hangouts until July 2016.
Video calls are sometimes a pain, particularly if you're on a slow internet connection. When you join the call, try to be on time for your scheduled slot and be on a fast enough connection so we don't have to spend too much time troubleshooting technical issues.
If you know you might have connectivity issues, it is also possible to join a video call by phone: call the number here, then enter the meeting ID.
The default for these video calls will be public because we think sharing ideas in the open helps everyone learn and improve but if you want to keep the conversation just between us, indicate that on the signup sheet and we'll boot people out and make the call invite-only when your time slot comes around.
The format for these is really determined by the type of questions or issues you have. To make the most of our time together you might want to prepare a list of questions or email us some background information, links to your website/project, git repos, etc. ahead of time so we can take a look and be better prepared to help you out.
If you have any questions or suggestions for us on how to make these office hours work best for you and your organization, email us anytime: nerds@inn.org.

Marie Eleanor (Annett) Goldhawk was born on December 9, 1928 in Cairo, Ontario and passed away on Tuesday, July 10, 2018 in London, Ontario. Daughter of the late Stanley and Barbara (Munro) Annett. Dearest wife of the late Don Goldhawk. Loving mother of Jim and Felicia Goldhawk, Pleasanton, California; Donna Goldhawk and Kevin White, London; Nancy Haldane, Kitchener; Gary and Robin Goldhawk, Danville, California; Mark and Laura Goldhawk, Sunol, California. Adored grandmother of Christopher and Anthony; Ashley, Adam, Sam and Patrick; Camille and Claire; Danny, Erica and Jeremy. Survived by sisters-in-law Betty Annett, Watford and Lois Goldhawk, Burlington and brother-in-law Lyle Goldhawk and wife Margaret, Blenheim. Marie trained at the London Normal School and taught in both one room schoolhouses in rural southwestern Ontario as well as Rosedale Elementary School in Toronto. She was a devoted homemaker, a loyal and generous friend, a good neighbour and a proud citizen. Marie developed a strong interest in improving the understanding of mental health disorders, including schizophrenia and neurodegenerative disease. Marie was salt for the earth; she will be truly missed by friends and family. A Funeral Mass will be celebrated at ST. GEORGE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH, 1164 Commissioners Road West, London on Monday, July 16, 2018 at 1:00 p.m., with visitation from 12:00 to 1:00 p.m. Interment of cremated remains at St. Michael’s Cemetery, Ridgetown. Your kind donation to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) Foundation would be greatly appreciated.
Gerry and Dianne BoulterOur deepest condolences to you all over Marie's passing. Marie was a wonderful woman and it was our privilege to have known her. She will be sorely missed.
Judy AndersonMrs. Goldhawk was my grade 2 teacher at the old Rosedale School: it was replaced by a new building in about 1957. I remember Mrs. Goldhawk being a quiet, thoughtful woman. I believe she was pregnant that year. She had very dark hair but this picture looks like her! We never considered that our teachers had first names in those days! I'm glad to see that "Marie" had a long, happy life and a big family. I'm a teacher too--45 years--and I'm now nearly 70: it's hard to believe. I'm very sorry for your loss. RIP, Marie.
Susan SmytheSo sorry to hear of your Mom's passing. It is hard to lose a parent but I hope you will recall many happy memories whenever you think of her.
Valerie + Brad PaulSo sorry to hear of the passing of Aunt Marie. She was truly one of a kind, a loving, compassionate and beautiful lady. She will be missed in the “Goldhawk “ family. Our condolences to her children, grandchildren, extended family and friends.
Dale (Mary) MunroThrough the years, Marie contacted me periodically to touch base on news or updates regarding the Munro family. I was always impressed by her very real concern for others. We discussed our shared interests in family history & my professional work in mental health. At this time, our sincere thoughts are with the Goldhawk & Annett families.
Mary StearnsSo very sorry to hear of Marie's passing. Marie was an active yoga participant in my classes (Can Do Yoga) for years. She started shortly after her husband passed away, and continued right up until the end of July 2017 when the classes ended. I (and we) always enjoyed and appreciated Marie's presence. She had so much to offer, and also delighted in whatever new information came her way. We last saw her in September 2017 when she joined us in St. Joseph's for a class get together to see how everyone was doing. It is hard to imagine that she is longer with us, and most importantly, with you. She always spoke fondly of the members of her family. Do hold your memories close. You are in my thoughts and prayers.
Margy and Al GrankenDear Aunt Marie you will be deeply missed. Jim, Donna, Nancy, Mark and Gary - you and your families are in our thoughts and prayers - your mother was a kind and thoughtful and classy lady. Her memory will live on in all of us who had the honour of knowing her. Margy (Ann) and Al Granken
Beth JamesI am very sad to hear of Marie's passing. I was her neighbour until I moved to Leamington in 2006. We kept in touch via email and the occasional phone call plus we tried to have a yearly lunch in Erieau. That didn't happen as often as we would have liked but I did see her in the late summer of 2016 at Molly and OJ's. That get-together was followed by sharing many laughs sitting on one of the benches on the boulevard. I had emailed her on June 14 and when I didn't hear back, I assumed she was in California visiting family. A mutual friend was kind enough to be in touch with the sad news. I'm glad to have such wonderful memories of our last get-together. Marie was a kind and gentle woman. She was an excellent neighbour and a very good friend. I will miss her.
Fritz and MilkaWe just now found out about Marie and are quite saddened to hear about her passing. Knowing Marie over the past 15 years has been a real honour and pleasure. A very lovely friendly lady. She will be missed. Our deepest condolences to Marie’s entire family. RIP dear Marie Fritz and Milka

I've read all the posts over the last year and think I've got things just about sussed. I have the A1 and I'm on the verge of going for the Gates housing because 1) I have one for my PD170, it's rugged and Gates have fantastic customer support. 2) The Gates (along with others) access the assignable button allowing MWB.
What I'm still not sure about, is it's performance compared to the Z1. I know the A1 suffers in low light but are we talking low ambient light in clear waters? My passion is deep wreck video, will I notice the low light performance when using my 23w Kowalski HID's?
I've run a couple of tapes through the A1 on the surface and the colour looks a little flat compared to my PD170, anyone else notice this?
The A1 likes a lot of light. It dials in gain sooner than older DV cameras. It does not do well in lower light conditions. It really boils down to visibility around the wreck and how powerful your lights are. I don't think anyone here can tell you definitively how the A1 will do because they haven't tested it in the conditions you want to use it in. I've tested quite extensively for macro and limited wideangle stuff. With lights, the macro was top notch. Wideangle depended on the viz and available sunlight. it worked fine when I had 300W halogens on a subject 2 feet away in dim water.
As for broadcast standards, which tier are you referring to? DV is stll accepted as a broadcast standard. HDV is a bit of a quandry, whereby they want to uprez to HDCAM or more before beaming it at 1080i again.
Having had a quick browse over your website I'd stick with the PD170 for now and wait to see what comes up on the next line of HDV cams.
As you seem to do a lot of 50+metre dives you would need a monster light bank to get anything decent with hdv cams at the moment. Unless the viz is outstanding with sunlight piercing all the way in.
Join us for an Underwater Photography Workshop in the Lembeh Strait at NAD Lembeh with Doug Sloss in 2018
It looks like I'll have to wait to see if the low light performance of the next generation of HD cams has improved.
These days the TV companies insist on HD but they don't realise that I can get them better footage with a PD170!
I was recently fiming on an 80m wreck off Falmouth, England. I managed to capture some decent images, but some of the best shots were using ambient light, with my dive partner (Teresa) highlighting objects with her wide angle HID.
On the same dive was a diver with an A1E. When back on shore and checking out the footage the A1E was virtually a black screen except for close up shots. At first I thought this was user error/camera setup, but now realise it was due to lack of low light performance of the HVR A1E. This is a shame as the A1 is a great little camera.
Does the Z1 perform better under low light conditions? Not that I can afford the 7000 UK pounds for a Z1 and Gates.
The Z1 has a lux rating of 3 (USA rating) where the A1 is 7lux.. I think your PD170 is 1lux ??? So the Z1 is better.
With your niche deep dives you will need to hold out for a while. I think I made the right decision with the a1 for what I needed it for. As I can upgrade in the future when the better cams come out.
This is a very interesting, and relevant, comment for me. The dives I do and the footage I like to collect is of wrecks in poor visibility conditions. Some are below 200 fsw so your post is right about where I would be interested. I've been contemplating the HC3, which is supposed be slightly better than the A1/HC1 in low light conditions, but it seems that all roads (in these discussions of low-light performance) leads to the FX1/Z1 for HDV. I'd love it if Sony came out with an alternative, but since they seem keen on going with CMOS, the FX1 seems like the best (but expensive) choice out there.
I'd be curious to know about HC3 and how well IT compares against the PD170 - anyone up to the challenge?

so sorry could not participate this week but I am on a 3 weeks’holiday in Elba island and had some problems with pc and internet connection.
Jasmina, Wonderful gallery of black and white images, Thanks for hosting the event and adjusting my entry at last moment. I loved these spoon shaped dividers between images, nice match up with your dotted side borders.
Daily blog of general status of circumstances made public in more detail at my personal website and domain: WWW.jbhFILE.COM. Subjects and daily events are discussed quite casually here and nothing stated in this blog should be considered matter of fact. For the details of the circumstances that this blog further discusses, please see my main site, at WWW.jbhFILE.COM
So a guy I know recently started a fairly sophisticated marijuana grow operation; said guy is not a close friend of mine; we do not "hang out" or otherwise regularly associate...but we did...in a certain sense, "come up together" in the local Houston surfing scene and what not, having been acquainted for well nigh 25 years now, if but loosely.
And frankly, I find this sort of surprising in it's own right since he's a family guy, has a wife and children and what not ... and is generally an upstanding citizen most days; which is to say that it's a little surprising that he'd be willing to risk all of that by becoming a mass grower of hydroponic weed.
Anyway, what cocks my eyebrow (good word, "cock") is the fact that he's a long time best bud of one of the fellows/families that I highly suspect as having been involved as informants to the investigation of myself over the past six years or so (hey, like it or not you simple fucks, some of your own people have talked).
Also, I'm interested in this peculiar bit of new information because I've known that supposed drug use (major drug use) has been a shiny little nugget on the wish list of the investigators in so far as some day creating the impression of my being the sort of person who "really needs help" (oh, you know, 90 days of court mandated observation, a month or two in some sort of ghey ass "recovery" ward, etc; use your imagination.)
I'm not much of a pot smoker, btw. I certainly was in the very, very distant past ... daily, even ... morning noon and night in my late twenties ... and, especially when I was employed as a work-from-home software designer. It just worked with the solitary nature of that profession and as well, the other artistic (musical and otherwise) projects I was involved in. It was fun ; I enjoyed it. But, that was a long time ago.
In fact, up until about four months ago, I hadn't partaken of "The Weed" for well over 8 years or more. I was actually somewhat fanatically vocal about it on my regular website for quite a few years as I knew it was one of the main "leverage lies" that the investigators wanted to use against me in so far as getting the proverbial ball rolling towards some sort of isolated environment (recovery, etc.) within which they could, er, "explore" until their hearts were content (which would be never, btw cause they are simply wrong about everything they so desperately desire me to be/represent and so the proper phrase would be so that they could, er, "manufacture" until their hearts content; but, that's certainly for another blog).
Yes, it's true ... four months or so ago, I let my brother (who is a daily user of The Weed(tm)) "smoke me out" (as they say) before we saw a movie. I don't like the illegality of The Weed(tm), but I admit it, I find it quite the nice diversion and far away less physically damaging than is say, alcohol. So yeah, I burned with him and it was awesome. That said, refer to my main website jbhfile.com to read about my current and official standing regarding such activities (association with The Weed(tm). But loosely said, I'm certainly not a regular purchaser of such contraband and nor shall I be. The little experiment with my sibling 4 months back was just that ... an experiment ... the satisfying of personal curiosity regarding something I'd not taken part in for a very very long time. And, as mentioned, it was certainly a hoot!
Shortly after the harmless little "soiree" with my brother is when I heard "thru the grapevine" that this particular above mentioned old friend had suddenly started a rather professional and elaborate hydroponic, marijuana grow operation. Furthermore, the other friend who I mentioned, who has been an informant to the investigation over the years, suddenly started having some free samples that he *really* wanted to give me ("for the road" and all). LOL. Seriously, there at the beginning of my knowledge of these things, old informant friend seemed to always have a bit laying around that he wanted me to "try out," etc. I mostly declined ... and totally declined once I smelled the proverbial rat.
So what does this have to do with jbhfile.com and my personal efforts to prove an investigation of myself has existed for well nigh 20 years now?
The first and most obvious "red flag," if you will is that, as with many years ago, the iatrogenic quacks behind the investigation still desperately would like to relegate me to some sort of isolated environment for poking and prodding and the manufacturing of what the quacks would end up calling "classic elements of the existing profile." You pick the particular flavor of psycho-idiotic cliche': "over sexualization as a youth resulting in adult promiscuity and a hyper developed, yet unconscious sense of sexual aggressiveness, forwardness or neediness as an adult" ... or ... "molested as a child and therefore this recent internet activity is really concerning because all of us Idiot Psychiatrists(tm) know beyond a doubt that 9 out of 10 molestation victims are likely to molest children themselves as an adult" ... (oh! Much biting of nails and gnashing of teeth!) ... or ... "this is why he was looking at those 18 - 25 year old girls on porn sites! He's unconsciously drawn to adolescent or near adolescent women because he's a classic case of the 40 something male longing to hold on to his youth!" ... (oooooh the danger in that!) ... or ... "clearly a narcissistic personality who needs constant validation from the opposite sex and therefore this is why he chooses to jog with his shirt off or wear revealing clothing, etc." .... (Aiiii! The shame in that!!!) ... but I will digress because it's old news at this point.
So yeah ... obviously, being associated with such an illicit substance as The Weed(tm) could indeed act as a very convenient springboard into some sort of court mandated, extended stay at this crazy house or that. And the important point here is the removal of free will ... to create a legal situation wherein I have no recourse but to follow orders or otherwise suffer the very likely consequence of further compounding my situation (or lengthening my stay, if you will).
One salient point to this whole little decade long debacle is the fact that if *any* surveillance of myself is *ever* displayed in a *public* venue, then I will have, in essence, succeeded in proving a long winded and (for the most part) politically motivated investigation of myself exists ... and here ... most importantly, an investigation related to the sorts of topics I've been harping on for the past ten years in my various writings (jbhfile.com, etc.).
And knowing that the idiots behind the corrupt and violent assault on myself intend to never publicly own that an investigation has existed (since that would then shed a more credible light on some of my other claims like being covertly overdosed on PCP, etc.), then that in turn gives me the opportunity to fuck with the surveillance guys as much as I like ... at least as a simple/gross attempt at creating such bothersome content that they might someday hold it against me publicly ... at which point, (at least as I imagine it to unfold in my fantastic imagination) I might be able to then say to everybody who has been calling me crazy, "TOLD YOU SO!".
So regarding that initial statement (the above paragraph) ... I've made a point over the past few years to give the surveillance guys something provocative to surveil ... which is to say, when in those environs that I highly suspect audio surveillance to be taking place ... I go off on wild and seriously demented verbal tangents about all sorts of sick shit. I mean I really go for it. It's horrific and it even bothers me a bit to vocalize such content but I keep in mind the fact that I have a point to make and so I make it. Anything at the extreme end of Violence(tm), Sex(tm), Necrophilia(tm) and in relation to Children(tm), Babies(tm) and more ... is what I heartily go at verbally. Really, I've considered becoming a horror writer as I've personally been impressed (horrified) at my own imagination the past few weeks. Shoosh! Really bad shit (really fun and funny at the same time because though I can't prove it yet, I happen to know they are getting it).
And trust me, I will certainly not replicate any of it here because it is the penultimate of vile; but, suffice it to say, I engage in this sort of "taunting" because hey, it's just me in the privacy of my own mind or in the privacy of my own home or workplace with no other human witnesses present (other than the whackos) and there is certainly no will or meaning behind the rants and so ... no harm done.
"By the way, you can taunt them all you want in your head, since it is only you and the Nazis there. Likewise, curse the pigs that bug your house (or workplace!) all you want. They just do not seem to understand that if they reveal anything they know about your private mentation or private conversations in your home they cannot call you crazy. It would be like entering the FBI tapes of Martin Luther King saying the FBI was out to get him as evidence that he was paranoid." --Allen L. Barker, "Mental Firewalls"
What if circumstances related to myself, which might warrant the need for legally approved surveillance, were suddenly manufactured in my life by the whackos behind this long winded debacle? I mean, specifically, circumstances that have nothing to do with the facts made known in jbhfile.com, but rather, around something else completely unrelated ... like my recently being introduced to this dude who is growing hydroponic marijuana (and who my brother, a daily smoker, is becoming closer and closer with). What about that, hmmm? I mean, it's a decent hypothetical! (Besides, the dude has already made two, er, "deliveries" to my brother at my family company ... and so, ...)
Well then, the whackos could confront me on any of the violent and depraved and sick nonsense that I've been "shouting to the air" in those areas I feel I might be surveilled, while also being able to claim that the surveillance itself had nothing to do with the "nonsense" I've been talking regarding an investigation of myself but instead had to do with mine and my brothers association with this pot growing dude; for instance, they might say:
"And in the course of analyzing that surveillance data, Mr. Harris, we became very concerned about some of your comments that we happened to catch on tape and it's been recommended you discuss such with a Specialist(tm)."
this post is intended to be supplemental to the facts made public in my main website, http://www.jbhfile.com/; it probably will not make much sense to you if you have not already made yourself aware of the legal and personal efforts discussed in that site. please see http://www.jbhfile.com/ for a necessary introduction into why this blog exists. or, if you just like reading weird stuff, then don't. and, enjoy.
A special message to my daily entourage (actually, it's usually late at night or real early in the morning that they're at their most bothersome; but you know, semantics and all):
Working a new blog entry tonight ... it's gonna be about shady marijuana growers ... and also, my favorite part ... how I verbally fuck with surveillance crews wherever I might think/imagine them to be surveilling ... and, there's only a couple places really, as it's only in those areas that I would so loudly rant about the sort of stuff (trust me, it's bad) I'm verbally/loudly ranting about.
The two are related, btw ... shady marijuana growers and my love of trying to prove an investigation against me exists; it sounds confusing, I know, and it is ... but it might make a bit more sense once I publish the article (but will probably still be confusing).
I've had a fantastic past two years or so. In fact, this is fairly close to how long it's been since I updated this blog, a good sign, that.
But as I've enjoyed the past months (got layed, caught lots of good surf, haven't been criminally jacked up by whacko/iatrogenic fucks yet and have been steadily employed) ... I've also had a teeny tiny watchful eye on those that still desire to turn me into something I'm not.
As I've mentioned in the past ... the iatrogenic wankers have egos bigger than (was going to say my penis but it's not all that big) and so I'll have to settle for planet Jupiter ... yes ... they are that bad in their "Narcissistic" world view of themselves (IE .. rape, pillage, ruin lives or whatever it takes to come out smelling rosy) (but hey, don't blame them ... most are whore academicians who, by nature, consider themselves [and their "systems"] beyond any reproach.) Typical.
Several recent developments beg ongoing and occasional mention here on my Bad Ass Mother Fucking Blog(tm) ... and so ... not wanting to spend too much time going over this or thinking about things (cause I do my best work when sleeping or simply following inspiration) ... I'll go ahead and cut to the chase.
I have fun on these sites ... not so much MySpace (aka "MyGhey") because it's recently been purchased by a media whore and is, indeed, beginning to resemble a media whore (as to be expected) ... but Facebooks more "dialogue based" interaction is actually very very fun. I'm friends with ex-girlfriends, friends and a few family members, there. And, as is my wont ... I write a lot there under the notes section (I'm a writer, after all) ... most of it sort of serious and personal observations, prose, poetry, random little stories ... some of it is rather offensive (I also enjoy cursing and blaspheming and being otherwise irreverent ... chalk it up to the writer circles I grew up in) ...
First ... it's online and supposed online misuse ... especially pirated software and illegal porn (pedophile porn! Yeah!) ... which have been a hallmark of the tactics used against me in the past. In fact, it was just a few short years ago when I actually got the courage to even *use* the internet again or possess a computer, such were the movements around me.
Second ... the potential to hack my account on Facebook (and MySpace) is always there ... not that I think too much could be done along those lines simply because of all the stuff I've published over the past six or so years ... but thought I'd mention it, anyway.
But really ... the main thing to note (never mind the hacking bit cause it's not that big of a deal) is that I'm using computers and the internet all day *every* day. WHOOOOO! I love the internet (and though free porn is really awesome on occasion) ... my main appreciation for it is checking the offshore forecasts and talking to my three real friends (LMFAO!) ... and as I've harped and harped and harped ... computers and the internet have been the core of just about every set up attempt I've witnessed .
I've also purchased a bad ass "Netbook" so that I could both write and do other online bantering (Facebook, research, etc.) wherever I happened to be hanging out drinking or eating.
That said ... I predominantly stay away from public wi-fi access points ... I don't need them because I have a (seriously) dope high speed connection on my cel phone (I use it as a portable router; I pay for it handsomely as it's quite expensive but it's just so fucking handy!).
But there is one fav bar of mine, however which was gracious enough to inform me of their *private* wi fi password (Cafe A****, in my favorite Houston area neighborhood, Montrose) ... this was before I had the high speed cel phone router and so I used it for a month or so when visiting that location. I've since not used it in the slightest as my phone works so good.
Anyway, it doesn't need to be reiterated at this point how potentially enticing that little above circumstance might be to folks who might like to somehow use it against me; the possibilities should be obvious as well (using their internet connection to download illegal content, or otherwise inappropriate content such as pornography or what have you). To my mind it's simply preposterous even reading that last sentence since I cannot really believe anyone would use a public point of access such as that for viewing of porn (in a fucking restaurant!!!???) but I have read stories of Real Pedophiles(tm) downloading all types of kiddie porn by parking outside of such establishments and downloading to their sick little heart is content.
So yeah ... the above mentioned restaurant and my particular knowledge of their *private* internal wi-fi is pretty damn important to mention here.
I no longer use their access point as one, my mobile phone router is faster and two, I'm really not comfortable being privy to folks private information regarding anything related to computers and the internet; but it is true that I'm still aware of the password and as far as whether they will change it or not is beyond me to know. Suffice it to say, however ...
Finally, simply apply the contents of the last above point to the following, fairly new developments in my daily life: I broke down and got one of those ghey ass "smart phones" you see everyone swiping and pecking at every where you go. I, on the other hand don't really swipe and peck at it too much as I predominantly use it as a high speed "mobile wi-fi hotspot." To that end, I also have recently purchased a 10.1 inch "Netbook" so that I could waste time on the internet wherever I happen to be.
And so, of course ... those two newly purchased items are not being used for any purpose that one could call ... hmmmm ... "questionable" ... or even grossly illegal.
Just another very simple little public disclaimer as said connection is certainly not being used for any nefarious or questionable purposes.

Modified Hyperbolic DCA (‘M-Hyp-DCA’) is the most widely used method in oil and gas production forecasting.

There is a trend for pumping bigger completions. Is bigger always better? The answer is “No!” Increasing completion size (more prop/ft, fluid/ft with more clusters) theoretically should increase the recovery to a certain point, which beyond that, it will only accelerate the recovery. Critical Completion Design “CCD” is defined as the point that EUR enhancement…Continue Reading “Big Completion Jobs are Not Always Better!” →
Many reservoir engineers are asking me what b-factor we should use to forecast wells?! Well, the short answer is “it depends”! b-factor is the derivative of 1/D (D=Nominal Decline) with respect to time and has no dimension. In early times, one could fit a set of production data with almost any value of b,…Continue Reading “How does b-factor change with completion and well spacing?” →
The fluid that covers the surface of conducting airways (airway surface fluid, ASF) is a critical component of one of the first defense mechanisms of the lung against microbial and other environmental insults. Despite its physiologic importance, ASF is one of the only fluids in the human body whose composition remains poorly defined and understood. Attempts to analyze ASF have been hampered greatly by the fact that it exists only as a very thin layer covering the mucosal surface of airway epithelia. To overcome some of these limitations, we have applied ultramicroanalytic techniques to microsamples collected in human airways in vivo. In contrast to previous thinking from studies on sputum samples, ASF collected from healthy airways contains much less Na and Cl (approximately 45% less) and much more K (around 600% more) than extracellular fluid or plasma (ECF), which shows that steep ion gradients exist across normal airway epithelia. These differences also show that ASF composition must be regulated and maintained by active electrolyte transport processes of airway epithelia and that it is not merely the evaporated residue of isotonic secretions or extracellular fluid exudate. However, in patients with sustained airway irritation, infection, or cystic fibrosis, we find that ASF composition appears to become more isotonic with respect to plasma and much more hypotoniv in patients with asthma.
Hydrogen ion titration of an affinity-purified mannose/glucose-specific lectin from Cajanus cajan pulse was carried out at 30°C and ionic strength of 0.15 by a discontinuous method. The titration was reversible in the pH range 2–12.0. The numbers of different ionizable groups per 39,000 g of the lectin were 43 carboxyl groups (pKint = 3.93), 10 imidazole groups, 21 ε-amino groups, 12.8 phenoxyl groups (pKint = 10.0), and 5 guanidyl groups. Only seven tyrosine residues of the lectin were dissociated under native conditions. The remaining six tyrosines became available for titration upon denaturation of the lectin in 9 M urea.
In order to investigate the expression of human cellular glutathione peroxidase (GPx), we mutated the gene encoding GPx by deleting either the 5′ or 3′ untranslated region (utr), subcloned the deleted fragments into plasmid pSVL followed by transfection into COS-7 cells and measured the amount of GPx expressed. When the 5′ utr of the gene was deleted, GPx was not expressed. However, the deletion of the 3′ utr resulted in some expression of GPx. Deletion of the poly A region of the GPx gene resulted in the expression of GPx but the level was lower than that of the full-length cGPx. The complete deletion of the 3′ utr resulted in a half of the expression of the poly A deletion mutant. Thus, the expression of GPx increased according to the length of the 3′ utr. These results suggest that the GPx gene carrying one SECIS on 5′ utr (FEBS Lett. 312(1992)10-14) is essential for GPx expression. SECIS on 3′ utr might not play a key role of GPx expression. Expression of GPx by COS-7 cells was not observed when a plasmid harboring an antisense gene was transfected.

What qualifies someone as a morning person? Is it the ability to jump up in the morning and go or is it the love for morning itself? Because if that’s the case, I am a morning person. I love feeling refreshed for the day and I am curious to see if my mornings are like anyone else’s in the world.
When I wake up to an obnoxious alarm, I do not jump out of bed. I’m literally the person who will open one eye and roll over to whatever side is darker. This is always the most challenging part for everyone isn’t it? Not just waking up, but actually getting yourself out of bed? Yeah, me too.
So after I open up one eye, I slowly will my other eye to open and just look around. This is when I take a few minutes to appreciate the warmth of my blanket burrito I am tucked in. I just think about the day ahead and take a few minutes to lay there and soak in a new day.
After I work up the courage to pull the blankets off and step out of bed, I definitely go to the bathroom because I feel like that’s what a lot of people do. Eight hours of holding it has to make you go! I swear if this is just a me thing I might be in disbelief for a solid year. This is where the other boring stuff happens like washing my face (which I definitely WISH I did every day but don’t), brushing my teeth, putting my contacts in if needed, etc.
After that, I chug a big glass of water. I don’t know when I started doing this exactly, but I think that at some point in my life my body just started working way too hard when I was sleeping and I would wake up super thirsty.
I would actually recommend you do this in the morning. Drinking a glass of water when you get up not only wakes you up even more, but its super good for you. That could be a good goal!
Then its time for pants. I’m going to be honest and say that I only wear actual jeans maybe twice a week and on those days I’m a little more reluctant to put on presentable clothes. Either way, I throw some clothes on that will either make me feel good or make me look good and brush through my hair. Am I the only one who dreads changing out of pajamas some days?
Honestly, this is usually when I’ll put on my shoes, grab my water bottle, throw on my back pack and head out the door. Once I leave, I arrive to work at about 8 am and no one is nearly as crazy enough as me to work in the morning as a college student but I thoroughly enjoy it. It’s nice and quiet and there aren’t people blasting music I despise or talking a bunch when you are trying to get work done.
Hey! Wow, I love your honesty, I don’t know if I could share so much about myself, and my daily routine, online, but I reckon it takes a certain kind of courage so I applaud you for that. 😉
By the way, drinking a glass of water is even recommended by doctors, so it’s very very good if you do that! lol
Yes, I always try to get out of my comfort zone too and it is an exhilarating feeling! I am trying to practice being more open about myself as well on the blog. It is a great exercise for me!

Heyoooooo... I’m sure you all know by now I’m a photographer who loves what I do. But I wrote something really personal over on @annamariephoto and I’d love for you to read it and if you like what I have to say, follow me. This art means more to me than I can possibly put into words and all I want to do is push myself into the world so I can capture more and more art to share with others. Also, I did self portrait with these bad boys and I love them. I love that you can see my rings because I’ve worn them since I was 18. I love that you can see my belly button ring, because my mom went with me when I was 17 and all of my cooler older cousins had one. 😉 I am so far from feeling like I have my life together and to be honest being in your 20s is like being told to swim in cement but I’m really freaking trying to figure it out. So to those of you who are in the same boat, you’re not alone. I ask that you support me in this amazing journey I’ve stepped into and keep me in mind when it comes to any photo needs. I’m working my ass off to be able to support myself off of this business and I can’t do it without you. ❤️ thank you, thank you, thank you.

Goju Ryu (hard soft style) Karate was likely descended from Whooping Crane Gung Fu. Whooping Crane was tuaght in the Fukien province of China.
Taught in Fukien, it was considered sister to the Shaolin style called Pan Gai noon. Thus, there are a couple of forms (sanction and seisan) that are common to both martial arts.
Master Higaonna would later send a young fellow name of Chojun Miyagi (now you know where the name of the teacher in the original Karate Kid came from!) to China, and Miyagi would study such martial arts as Shaolin and Pa Kua Chang.
Miyagi would found the official Goju Ryu system, and his method would include forms taught to him by Higaonno, and the softer and more subtle influences of Shaolin and Pa Kua Chang.
Those are the three main types of Karate. And, there is some overlap between Uechi Ryu and Goju Ryu.
Thus, if you really want to master Karate, you should study Matrix Karate, then the three main styles. But…you should study them in the right order.

For the reasons stated below, the Court grants in part TCS�s Motion for Summary Judgment, denies Onvoy�s Motion for Summary Judgment, and grants in part Onvoy�s Motion for Summary Judgment on Fraud and Punitive Damages Claims.
TCS aggregates long-distance telephone traffic to be terminated and transferred to other carriers. TCS and Onvoy entered into a one-year Telecommunications Services Agreement on September 12, 2001 (the �2001 Agreement�), under which TCS and
underlying carriers selected by TCS, including MCI WorldCom Network Services, Inc. (�MCI�), provided telecommunications services to Onvoy and its customers. The telecommunications services allowed Onvoy�s customers to originate long distance calls which terminated over the international public switch network worldwide. Under Federal Law, the underlying carriers were required to pay access charges to Onvoy and its local exchange telephone company customers. Under the terms of the 2001 Agreement, TCS had no obligation to pay its underlying carrier�s access charges. Specifically, the 2001 Agreement provided, in part:
TCS and any underlying carrier used by TCS will only bill for conversation minutes of use (�Conversation MOU�) . . . . Onvoy shall pay to TCS rates for Conversation MOU as set forth on the attached schedule. TCS� underlying carriers shall pay all access charges and centralized equal access charges for traffic carried under this contract, including all access charges for both origination and termination. . . .
(Decl. of Stacey A. Molde (�Molde Decl.�) � 2, Ex. 1 at � 3) (emphasis added.) The 2001 Agreement expired on or around September 11, 2002, and the parties subsequently operated under the terms of the 2001 Agreement on a month-to-month basis. TCS and Onvoy ultimately entered into a Telecommunications Services Agreement dated March 1, 2003 (the �2003 Agreement�). This case arises out of the terms of the 2003 Agreement.
On July 22, 2002, MCI filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At that time, MCI owed Onvoy 1,737.63 for unpaid access charges that had accrued under the 2001 Agreement.
The Chief Executive Officer of TCS, David Hattman, negotiated the 2003 Agreement with Onvoy in Fall 2002. In particular, on September 24, 2002, Hattman met with John Cerwick of Onvoy to discuss amending the 2001 Agreement. The next day, Cerwick sent Hattman an e-mail that attached a draft of the proposed 2003 Agreement dated September 20, 2002 (the �September 2002 Draft�). After reading the September 2002 Draft, Hattman called Cerwick and approved the draft, but did not sign it because he believed that the rates contained in the draft were incorrect. (Molde Decl. � 2, Ex. 9 (Dep. of David Hattman (�Hattman Dep.�)) at 86-88.)
The parties offer different versions of what they ultimately agreed to. It is undisputed that in the aftermath of the MCI bankruptcy Onvoy wanted TCS to be responsible for all unpaid access charges already incurred and any unpaid access charges going forward. Onvoy claims that TCS agreed to both past and future liabilities; TCS claims that it only agreed to guarantee defaulted access charges on a �going forward� basis.
TCS�s underlying carrier, or TCS in the event that the underlying carrier cannot meet its payment obligations, shall pay all access charges centralized equal access (CEA), origination, and termination charges for traffic carried under this contract. If such charges are not paid by TCS or its underlying carrier, Onvoy shall have the right to offset an equivalent amount of monies due TCS by Onvoy.
(Molde Decl. � 2, Ex. 16 at � 3.) Onvoy claims that following the circulation of the September 2002 Draft, Onvoy demanded that TCS make Onvoy whole based on MCI�s
inability to pay outstanding access charges. Specifically, Onvoy claims that its general counsel, Michael Hoff, had several conversations with Hattman about this issue. TCS maintains that Hoff had no role in negotiating the agreement with TCS and that all negotiations were with Cerwick.
We�ve reached the end [of] our proverbial rope with TCS and these settlement negotiations. The �escrow� has been dwindled from .2 million to zero, and now they are proposing that payout, if any, won�t come for years. It�s time to get paid on this debt.
We owe Hattman a response to today�s call. . . I will thank him again for his creativity, express interest in moving forward with this idea, an [sic] insist that we need to reach agreement on three things first: (1) anticipated WorldCom payout (assuming .70 right now), and (2) TCS� payment of the remaining .30 (or 0,000), and (3) settle-up process once WorldCom makes announcement. TCS needs to begin making good on this obligation to show good faith in moving forward together. This approach addresses each of the three above-described concerns and buys us some time to select a long-term LD services underlying carrier.
Longer term, our action regarding TCS will hinge more on the business decision regarding our underlying LD carrier(s) than anything else. If we continue to use (and need) TCS for our LD MOU�s, then I recommend we play ball with Hattman regarding settlement. If we no longer use (or need) TCS for our LD MOU�s, then I recommend withholding the full 1,993 from our final payment.
On January 15, 2003, Hattman met with Cerwick. Cerwick had prepared copies of the 2003 Agreement. Hattman �scanned� the 2003 Agreement, initialed each page, and signed the 2003 Agreement on behalf of TCS. Hattman maintains that he signed the 2003 Agreement believing that it was identical to the September 2002 Draft. TCS
discovered later, however, that the 2003 Agreement that Hattman signed contained the following language:
TCS�s underlying carrier, or TCS in the event that the underlying carrier cannot meet its payment obligations, shall pay all access charges and centralized equal access charges for traffic carried under this contract and all preceding contracts of the same nature, including all access charges for both origination and termination. If such charges are not paid by TCS or its underlying carrier, Onvoy shall have the right to offset an equivalent amount of monies due TCS by Onvoy.
(Molde Decl. � 2, Ex 2. at � 3.) The September 2002 Draft did not contain the italicized language. The record establishes that Hoff added the italicized language on January 13, 2003. Specifically, on January 10, 2002, Cerwick e-mailed Hoff a draft of the 2003 Agreement for Hoff�s review. On January 13, Hoff revised the draft agreement and added the italicized language. In an e-mail to Cerwick, Hoff bolded his insertion of the italicized language, but directed Cerwick to �remove the bold� once Cerwick read it. (Molde Decl. � 2, Exs. 8 & 12.) Cerwick removed the bolded insertion and presented the draft of the 2003 Agreement to Hattman. There is nothing in the record to show that this clearly material term was discussed or negotiated, let alone agreed upon, before being inserted by Onvoy.
At the time the 2003 Agreement was signed, and pursuant to the above italicized language, TCS became a surety for MCI�s 1,737.63 debt to Onvoy. Without notifying TCS, on or around May 2003, Onvoy transferred its entire claim against MCI to Contrarian Capital Management, LLC (�Contrarian�), for thirty percent of its value. The relevant �Transfer of Claim� reads in part:
SELLER [Onvoy] for good and valuable consideration does hereby irrevocably sell, convey, transfer and assign unto BUYER [Contrarian] all of SELLER�s [Onvoy�s] right, title and interest in, to and under:
the above-referenced claim of SELLER [Onvoy] (as defined in Section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code) against Debtor in the above-referenced Chapter 11 case (the �Case�), including, without limitation, any and all right to receive principal, interest and other amounts in respect of such claim;
all causes of action or other rights held by SELLER [Onvoy], whether against the Debtor or against any other party, including without limitation, any guarantor of the Debtor . . . in connection with the above referenced claim arising under or in connection with all agreements, invoices, purchase orders or other documents executed or delivered in connection with such claim;
all causes of action held by SELLER [Onvoy] in connection with the above-referenced claim against the Debtor or any other person or entity including without limitation, any guarantor of the Debtor . . . arising under any law, including without limitation causes of action for negligence, fraud or fraudulent transfers; and
all cash, securities or other property (�Distributions�) distributed or received on account of, or exchanged in return for, any of the foregoing;
all of the foregoing, whether against the Debtor, or any guarantor or other third party liable in respect thereof, being collectively referred to herein as the �Claim.�
On July 1, 2003, TCS sent Onvoy an invoice for 3,989.71. Onvoy offset and deducted 4,216.34 from the invoice�the remaining balance of the 3,989.71 claim that it had transferred to Contrarian. Onvoy then paid TCS 9,773.37 on the July 1, 2003 invoice.
On February 15, 2007, TCS brought this lawsuit, asserting claims for breach of contract, contract reformation, and unjust enrichment. On May 29, 2008, TCS filed an Amended Complaint adding causes of action for fraud and punitive damages. TCS now moves for summary judgment, alternatively, on its three original causes of action. In addition, Onvoy moves for summary judgment on TCS�s claims, including those for fraud and punitive damages.
Summary judgment is proper if there are no disputed issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The Court must view the evidence, and the inferences that may be reasonably drawn from the evidence, in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Enter. Bank v. Magna Bank of Mo., 92 F.3d 743, 747 (8th Cir. 1996). However, as the Supreme Court has stated, �[s]ummary judgment procedure is properly regarded not as a disfavored procedural shortcut, but rather as an integral part of the Federal Rules as a whole, which are designed �to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.�� Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 327 (1986) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 1).
The moving party bears the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Enter. Bank, 92 F.3d at 747. The nonmoving party must demonstrate the existence of specific facts in the record that create a genuine issue for trial. Krenik v. County of Le Sueur, 47 F.3d 953, 957 (8th Cir. 1995). A party opposing a properly supported motion for summary
judgment may not rest upon mere allegations or denials but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256 (1986).
To succeed on its breach-of-contract claim, TCS must prove four elements: (1) a valid contract; (2) performance by plaintiff of any conditions precedent; (3) a material breach of the contract by defendant; and (4) damages. Parkhill v. Minn. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 174 F. Supp. 2d 951, 961 (D. Minn. 2000) (citing Briggs Trans. Co. v. Ranzenberger, 217 N.W.2d 198, 200 (Minn. 1974)).
TCS contends that Onvoy breached the 2003 Agreement as a matter of law when it asserted an offset against the July 1 invoice because the offset was for the same debt that Onvoy had previously sold to Contrarian. TCS contends that at the time Onvoy took its purported offset, MCI did not owe Onvoy anything because Onvoy had transferred all rights to the MCI debt to Contrarian.
Onvoy opposes TCS�s motion and moves for summary judgment on TCS�s breach of contract claim. In support, Onvoy asserts that TCS�s obligations under the 2003 Agreement were unaffected by Onvoy�s Transfer of Claim. Instead, Onvoy asserts that it properly exercised its right to offset under Section 3 of the 2003 Agreement.1
TCS�s underlying carrier, or TCS in the event that the underlying carrier cannot meet its payment obligations, shall pay all access charges and centralized equal access charges for traffic carried under this contract and
Specifically, Onvoy asserts that the Transfer of Claim to Contrarian does not reference �debt� and that it only sold its right to payment from MCI, not TCS. In addition, Onvoy contends that even if the Transfer of Claim is broad enough to encompass its rights under the 2003 Agreement, an anti-assignment provision in the 2003 Agreement voided any purported transfer of rights to payment and setoff against TCS.
Neither party may assign its rights or delegate its duties hereunder without the written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, except that (i) if either party is sold or merged or a majority of the ownership of either party is changed, the acquiring entity shall acquire, together with the other party, the party�s rights and duties under this Agreement; and (ii) either party may assign its rights and delegate its duties to any entity which controls or is controlled by, or with which it is under common control.
The Court rejects Onvoy�s assertion that it only transferred its bankruptcy claim against MCI, and not its right to payment from TCS. The Court concludes that Onvoy transferred both the claim and the debt when it executed the Transfer of Claim. Indeed, the broad language in the Transfer of Claim indicates that Onvoy was not left with any interest in the MCI claim and that Onvoy transferred to Contrarian any guarantee
all preceding contracts of the same nature, including all access charges for both origination and termination.
obligation on the MCI debt. In particular, the Transfer of Claim provided that in addition to Onvoy�s claim against MCI, Onvoy transferred all right, title and interest in
all causes of action or other rights held by [Onvoy], whether against the Debtor or against any other party, including without limitation, any guarantor of the Debtor . . .
all causes of action held by [Onvoy] in connection with the above-referenced claim against the Debtor or any other person or entity including without limitation, any guarantor of the Debtor . . .
(Molde Decl. � 2, Ex. 3 at � 1.) Under the plain language of the Transfer of Claim, Onvoy no longer had a right to seek payment for MCI�s debt under the 2003 Agreement when Onvoy took its �offset� from the July 1 invoice. Thus, Onvoy breached the 2003 Agreement as a matter of law.
In addition, the Court rejects Onvoy�s assertion that the anti-assignment provision voids any purported transfer of rights to payment and offset against TCS. Although the assignment clause in the 2003 Agreement prohibits the parties from assigning their rights or delegating their duties under the contract without the written consent of the other party, Onvoy has not cited to any authority suggesting that the effect of the anti-assignment provision restores Onvoy�s right to offset against TCS after it sold its claim against MCI to Contrarian. In particular, none of the cases relied on by Onvoy stand for the proposition that a party who breaches a non-assignment clause can then assert the clause to its own benefit.
A court may reform a written contract if the moving party proves by �clear and consistent, unequivocal and convincing� evidence that: �(1) there was a valid agreement between the parties expressing their real intentions, (2) the written instrument failed to express the real intentions of the parties, and (3) this failure was due to a mutual mistake of the parties, or a unilateral mistake accompanied by fraud or inequitable conduct by the other party.� Manderfeld v. Krovitz, 539 N.W.2d 802, 805 (Minn. Ct. App. 1995) (quoting Nichols v. Shelard Nat�l Bank, 294 N.W.2d 730, 734 (Minn. 1980)). The district court has discretion as to whether to reform a contract. See In re Estate of Savich, 671 N.W.2d 746, 751 (Minn. Ct. App. 2003).
TCS moves for summary judgment on its reformation claim, asserting that the 2003 Agreement failed to express both parties� intentions because it contained the disputed eight additional words�and all preceding contracts of the same nature�to which TCS did not agree. TCS asserts that Hattman mistakenly believed that the agreement he signed was identical to the draft he reviewed in September 2002. TCS further asserts that Onvoy engaged in fraudulent and inequitable conduct by inserting the eight words and concealing their insertion from Hattman.
Onvoy opposes TCS�s motion and moves for summary judgment on TCS�s reformation claim. Onvoy asserts that contract reformation is not available as a matter of law because TCS cannot establish that Onvoy engaged in fraud or inequitable conduct. In support, Onvoy points to the fact that the parties are sophisticated business entities who engaged in an arms-length negotiation, that Hattman was given the opportunity to
review the 2003 Agreement before signing, and that Hattman could have asked Cerwick if any changes were made. Onvoy asserts that had Hattman read the agreement, he would have discovered the change.
After reviewing the record before it, the Court concludes that fact issues preclude summary judgment for either party on TCS�s contract reformation claim. TCS has asserted a reformation claim under the theory of a unilateral mistake coupled with fraud or inequitable conduct. TCS has pointed to record evidence that demonstrates that Hattman was under the mistaken belief that he was signing a copy identical in all material respects to the September 2002 Draft that he had previously reviewed. In addition, facts in the record that relate to Onvoy�s last-minute insertion of the disputed language in the 2003 Agreement, if believed by a fact-finder, could support a finding of fraud or inequitable conduct on the part of Onvoy. These factual issues are for a jury to decide. Accordingly, both parties� motions for summary judgment on TCS�s reformation claim are denied.
Onvoy also moves for summary judgment on TCS�s fraud claim. Onvoy asserts that the fraud claim fails because TCS has identified no affirmative representation by Onvoy, the parties engaged in an arms-length transaction, and fraudulent concealment does not apply. In essence, Onvoy contends that it owed no duty to disclose to TCS that it had inserted the disputed contract language. Onvoy further asserts that TCS�s fraud claim fails because it is not distinct from TCS�s claim for breach of contract.
To recover under theories of both contract and tort, TCS must prove separate damages for fraud and breach. Hanks v. Hubbard Broad., Inc., 493 N.W.2d 302, 308 (Minn. Ct. App. 1992). A party is not entitled to recover tort damages for a breach of contract unless the breach constitutes or is accompanied by an independent tort. Cherne Contracting Corp. v. Wausau Ins. Cos., 572 N.W.2d 339, 343 (Minn. Ct. App. 1997).
Here, TCS�s fraud claim is based on Onvoy�s conduct prior to execution of the 2003 Agreement. In particular, TCS asserts that Onvoy represented to TCS that it was entering into the 2003 Agreement to do business with TCS for another year and points to record evidence that could lead a reasonable juror to conclude that Onvoy actually entered into the 2003 Agreement to obtain a basis to assert its purported offset. In addition, TCS points to record evidence that could lead a reasonable juror to conclude that Onvoy deceptively inserted language into the 2003 Agreement that altered the terms that the parties agreed to in a material way. TCS could have pursued a fraud claim even if Onvoy never breached the 2003 Agreement. Based on the record before it, the Court determines that TCS�s breach of contract and fraud claims are not based on the same facts. In addition, these two causes of action do not seek the same damages. In particular, if TCS succeeds on its fraud claim, it could recover money that Onvoy retained as an offset to its invoice plus interest, as well as out of pocket damages, including loss of business. See, e.g., B.F. Goodrich Co. v. Mesabi Tire Co., Inc., 430 N.W.2d 180, 183 (Minn. 1988); Lewis v. Citizens Agency of Madelia, Inc., 235 N.W.2d 831, 836 ( Minn. 1975).
(1) there was a false representation by a party of a past or existing material fact susceptible of knowledge; (2) made with knowledge of the falsity of the representation or made as of the party's own knowledge without knowing whether it was true or false; (3) with the intention to induce another to act in reliance thereon; (4) that the representation caused the other party to act in reliance thereon; and (5) that the party suffer[ed] pecuniary damage as a result of the reliance.
Hoyt Props., Inc. v. Prod. Res. Group, L.L.C., 736 N.W.2d 313, 318 (Minn. 2007). In addition, when parties make a verbal agreement and one party undertakes to reduce that agreement to writing, �the presentation of the written instrument for signature is a representation that it is the same in effect as their verbal agreement.� Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Roth, 242 N.W. 629, 631 (Minn. 1932).
Based on the record before it, the Court concludes that fact issues remain with respect to the substantive merit of TCS�s fraud claim. The issue of whether Onvoy�s conduct, with respect to the insertion of the disputed contract language into the 2003 Agreement, constitutes fraud is an issue properly left for a fact-finder. Accordingly, the Court denies Onvoy�s motion for summary judgment on TCS�s fraud claim.
To establish a cause of action for unjust enrichment, TCS must show that Onvoy �knowingly received something of value, not being entitled to the benefit, and under
2 Onvoy asserts that fraudulent concealment only supports the tolling of the statute of limitations. A claim of fraud based on fraudulent concealment, however, is distinct from the theory of fraudulent concealment to toll the statute of limitations. Iverson v. Johnson Gas Appliance Co., 172 F.3d 524, 529 n.3 (8th Cir. 1999).
circumstances that would make it unjust to permit its retention.� Southtown Plumbing, Inc. v. Har-Ned Lumber Co., Inc., 493 N.W.2d 137, 140 (Minn. Ct. App. 1992). Onvoy claims that a party cannot recover on a claim for unjust enrichment if such claim is based on a breach of an express contract.
TCS has alleged a claim for unjust enrichment as an alternative theory in the event that the 2003 Agreement is deemed invalid. TCS also alleges that Onvoy�s alteration of the agreement is fraud per se. TCS asserts that a finding of fraud will warrant rescission of the contract and TCS�s remedy will be in unjust enrichment.
The Court concludes that Onvoy�s motion for summary judgment on TCS�s unjust enrichment claim is premature because, at a later date, it is possible that the 2003 Agreement will be deemed invalid.
Limitation of Liability. Notwithstanding the provision of Section 5 of this Agreement, in no such event shall either party be liable to the other party to this Agreement for special, indirect, incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages, including loss of profits, customers, or goodwill, arising from interruption of service or otherwise relating to the relationship or conduct of business hereunder.
Onvoy contends that TCS�s punitive damages claim is barred as a matter of law by the plain language of Section 6. In particular, Onvoy contends that Section 6 expressly bars punitive damages based on Onvoy�s alleged conduct �relating to the relationship� of
the parties. TCS asserts that Onvoy cannot rely on a provision of the very agreement which it fraudulently altered to limit its liability for that fraud.
The Court agrees with Onvoy. The broad language of Section 6 of the 2003 Agreement plainly limits the type of damages available to TCS. The fact that this provision was included in the 2001 Agreement indicates that this provision was previously contemplated and agreed upon by the parties and was not inserted as a result of Onvoy�s alleged fraud.

You'd think with all my video game experience that I'd be more prepared for this: Favourite bits from SPIN Selling
There is a wonderful passage in The Boys in the Boat. The book, which tells the story of the University of Washington rowing team in their pursuit of Olympic gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, focuses mostly on a young man named Joe Rantz. Rantz had experienced a horrible childhood. His mother died when he was four years old, and his stepmother began throwing him out of the house around age ten. In the end, he would end up abandoned by his family and end up hunting and foraging for his own survival. His father would eventually intervene, only to abandon Joe again when he moved the entire family.
Asked by his fiancee why he wasn’t mad about all of this, how he seemed to take this betrayal and loss so stoically, he tells her:
“It takes energy to get angry. It eats you up inside. I can’t waste my energy like that and expect to get ahead. When they left, it took everything I had in me just to survive. Now I have to stay focused. I’ve just gotta take care of myself.”
And of course, Rantz was well-served by this strategy. A longshot for making the crew at University of Washington, his team would end up narrowly beating Italy in the 1936 Olympics and winning the gold medal. But even if he hadn’t achieved all that success, had he not “gotten ahead”—to use his term—he still would have been right.
The Stoics saw anger as a destructive, draining weight that we add on top of already difficult situations. Like Rantz, they questioned who can afford to burn up so much energy? Things are tough enough, why put yourself further behind just because it might feel good to yell? Or to carry a grudge? Nobody abandons a family because they didn’t know it was wrong. Nobody is going to stop hurting you because you resent them for it. And no amount of rage will ever change the past.
It’s hard enough to survive life as it is. Getting mad about the unfairness or maddening randomness of it all wastes too much energy. Let’s focus our energy on where it can actually make a difference.

Oracle is a freeware program for windows for all kinds of oracles. It can do tarot, Itjing and various other divination systems.
This contains the Itjing, a small Rider deck, the Aquatic deck, English and Dutch languages and helpfiles and some spreads.
This is a program for Itjing, Tarot cards or other spread methods. You can define or 'plug in' your own deck of cards as well as your own spread methods, the program is highly configurable.
Spreads are automatically saved, at startup the last spread is always displayed. When more then 50 spreads are saved, the oldest ones are deleted.
To do a spread with cards, first select a deck in the Deck menu. When you first install Oracle, the Aquatic deck is active. You can see the number of cards in the deck, for a tarot deck this is always 78. Then choose a spread in the Spread menu. The first card is shown and the program waits for a keypress or a mouseclik and then the subsequent cards are drawn.
A double click on a card in a spread will show that card full size. Press F4 or escape to go back to the spread.
If the toolbar is visible (see Settings - Show Toolbar) you will see two edit boxes with arrows. The left one changes the size of cards, the right one changes the width of cards.
Loads a saved spread. The names of the spreads are composed of a part with the date and time (yy-mm-dd) and the name of the spreadmethod, for instance '03-12-08 21.22.38 Chakra.ora'.
Saves the current spread. Although this is done automatically this can be desired if you have chosen another deck of cards to display the spread and you want to save the spread with this deck. Besides you can supply a name for the spread yourself.
If you supply a name that does not start with a digit, like 'my birthday 03-03-14 21.22.38 Chakra.ora, the spread is never deleted even if it becomes old.
This lets you browse the available decks. This is like when you choose another deck in the Deck menu. If a spread is displayed on screen and the new choosen deck contains the same number of cards as the one used in the current spread, the current spread is redisplayed with the new choosen deck.
Lets you browse through the current deck. You can vieuw a certain card and then choose another deck with the same number of cards to view the same card from another deck. Press F4 or escape or clcik a card to go back.
The editbox for changing the size of cards is disabled in this mode because cards are shown at maximum size. You can enable changing size again by checking the box inbetween the two editboxes.
This is a little editor for making spread files and such. After closing the editor the program scans it's map again for spread en card files. See below for special editor functions.
Displays or hides the list with saved spreads. You can browse the saved spreads. A right mouse click opens a menu to delete or rename a file.
Use this to store spreads you have made outside Oracle. First turn on Diary, then choose a spread. You will see the spread but all cards will show the back side. Now if you right click on a card you can select the card you want. The spread is automatically saved with a name beginning with an underscore.
If a spread is displayed on screen and the new choosen deck contains the same number of cards as the one used in the current spread, the current spread is redisplayed with the new choosen deck.
If you have dragged cards to a new position you can save the current positions of the cards for this spread method. All spreads with this method will be shown in these new positions.
Toggles full screen mode. If full screen mode is on, you cannot see the menu but you can use the shortcut keys. Press F11 again or escape to turn of full screen mode.
If a certain oracle has more then one interpretation file, here you can choose which one you want to use. For exampe for the tarot there is an interpretation file in Dutch as wel as English. First choose on the left for tarot, then choose on the right for the texts you want to use with the tarot.
Here you can define the size of the images for each deck of cards individually. If the toolbaar is visible you can also set the size with the editbox. Allowed values for cards are 10 - 300, for Itjing 100 - 200, other values are ignored.
You can switch between two methods for the itjing, the 'normal' way has a chance of 1 in 4 for a moving line, the Yarrow Stalks method has a chance of 1/16 for a moving yin, a chance of 3/16 for a moving yang, a chance of 7/16 for normal yin and 5/15 for normal yang.
Enter the number of cards and a file will be generated with this amount of # and the like to use as a template for a new spread.
The layout of this file is as follows: each position will begin with a #, then a number for the horizontal position, then a number for the vertical position, and at last a text describing the position. .
The numbers for horizontal/vertical position represent the percentage of screenspace, meaning 0 horizontal is dead-left on the screen, 50 in the middle etc.
Note, you can also move the cards around by dragging them to positions and then use Settings - Save Position to define the positions.
For a deck 3 things are needed: a map with the actual images (bmp or jpg), a textfile with the filenames of these images and a textfile with the description of the cards.
The textfile with the filenames of the images should be put in the program map and should have the same name as the map with the images and extension '.car', for instance 'MyDeck.car'.
After the filenames for the pictures should come a line starting with a # and then either the name of an ordinary textfile (*.txt) which then will be used as interpretation texts for these cards, or the name of a so called pointer file.
This is because a deck can be associated with an interpretation file in 2 ways, directly by providing the name of a textfile (*.txt) after the #, or by providing the name of a pointer file (*.ptx).
This is usefull if there are several interpretation files for a given deck of cards, for instance in different languages.
A pointer file should look like this, first an asteriks *, then the name of one of the supplied textfiles, then a space and lastly the number of cards in the deck.
The file with the descriptions should also be put in the program map. Descriptions should be separated with a # and there should be as many descriptions in the file as there are cards in the deck.
The file with the descriptions can also contain a single line containing a * and a filename. This filename will then be used as the file for descriptions.
First you are asked for a map. A deck for oracle should have it's pictures in a map under the map of the program. You can select an existing map (you can also doubleclik on a map) or fill in the name of a new map in the field 'new folder'.
When you press Ok and the field 'new folder' is not empty and that map does not yet exists, you are asked if you want to create it.
If a .car file already exists for this map it is loaded. After that the map is scanned for additional pictures. A new window appears with on the left a list with the .car file and/or other found pictures. On the right you see the current picture.
Now you can change the order of the pictures by dragging en dropping them to another place in de list. For instance to be consistant with the interpretation texts a tarot deck always must start with the Great Arcana, then come cups, then wands and so on. This can also be done with selections.
If you are satisfied with the order you can save the list (alt-F2), the list will appear in the editor as a .car file. Now you can add a line with a # and an interpretation file as described above. Then you save the .car file from the editor and you are ready to use your new deck.
Righthand mouse click on one of the files in the box will present a menu with rename and delete for that file.
This is a function specially for tarot cards. Make a selection in the list and then use this function to rename that selection to the appropiate tarot part. Select for instance 14 cards, then choose rename and enter 1, those cards will be renamed to cups01.jpg, cups02.jpg etc.
This will rewrite all the cards in the map to the size they have in the right window pane. Everything in the map will be overwritten, make backup first! This should be used only to change the filesize of a deck. Changing size of cards can easily be done in the program itself.
Enter the name of a map and all jpg's from that map will be copied to this map. The list will appear in the window.
This is an alternate way to select files. First check the boxes, then issue this command, then you can drag and drop these selected files.
You can also create a file with extension .hty, this is a helpfile with extra information, for instance about a spread. These files will appear below the general helpfiles.
Warning, if you are going to play with making spreads, decks, helpfiles etc. be precise. Take care that a files exists, that is has the right name and the right format. Otherwise things will not work as expected.

Slamming my head and body into a concrete wall at a high rate of speed. Check mark on the bucket list! I loved every minute of it!
There is so much build up to game day! I'm dealing with my nerves by soaking up all of the support from our fans. The clinic where I work has declared this Friday as "Purple Friday." My little sister made a poster for the team. Knowing that my mom and sister back home are showing support from so far away is the best feeling!
Pics from my first derby bout. This was truly the most amazing night. Proper words are still not there to describe the feeling of playing derby.
My boss is giving us an hour off today for a derby pep rally. "How to be a derby fan 101" and glittery sign making. 2 days 'till Game Day! My co-workers are the best!
I am going to bed with an ice pack in tow and hope to practice jamming in my sleep, hopefully with fewer penalties this time.
I've been excited for weeks to put on my finest derby fishnets and jump into an icy lake to raise money for the Special Olympics. There was not much ice but the temperature wasn't particularly kind to our freezing cold limbs. I was so incredibly cold after the first hour following registration, that I found myself signing up and lining up for the 5K portion of the fundraiser. 35:32 was my clock time. Not bad for my very first 5K and first time running in nearly a year. I feel another obsession coming on.
A stack of checks on my desk this morning made out to "Dead Girl Derby." My co-workers are ready for DERBY! Let me know if you want to get
Pace lines with friends and outside voices are encouraged. I can become Stitch and forget that my professional self exists.
My derby name has been submitted and approved by my league and appears to have cleared the national roster! You can now refer to me as "Stitch." I'll be skating as "Stitch Reaper" #8.6 yds.
You may remember last year's tutorial for up-cycled leg warmers, made from the remains of my sweater from the Dead Girl Derby Ugly Sweater Party. It's that time again, but this year, I will be attending as a Dead Girl!
5 minutes of fame as a leg model for our league's flag football event. Art work by the talented, Edith Myrant.
It finally happened! I am officially a "fully dead" Dead Girl Derby skater. I am proud to announce that I was drafted onto the Royal Pains. Watch out for this team in 2012! We will be a purple force to be reckoned with. The draft night was the most amazing experience. Picture somewhere between 65-75 people from the league in my house...screaming when the draft calls came in and partying the night away. I'll never forget that night.
With all of the excitement of the last two weeks, I haven't had a chance to announce that as of October 9th, I am officially a roller girl with Dead Girl Derby of Kansas City! I passed all of my skills tests and I'm anxious to start the draft process in November!
My new 7 Deadly Sin Tights...I see you trying to creep up on me sloth! This is my favorite Etsy purchase to date.
Here it goes...confessions of fresh meat. I am now half-way through the new recruit process with the Dead Girl Derby league in Kansas City. The fateful night of skills testing will be here before I know it. The past several weeks have been such an amazing experience that I have not yet been able to set down and put it into words. Friends and co-workers ask me how practice has been going and what it is like to try out for a roller derby league. I give them a basic answer and post the general status updates, but I really never try to paint a vivid picture of what the experience has been like for me so far. I cherish the experience so much that I almost selfishly try to keep it all to myself.
So many emotions are wrapped up in this process for me. Fear (of getting my ass kicked or embarrassed), pride (I bust at the seams with it when I think about Dead Girl Derby), reprisal on the memories of my bullies (all of those popular athletes in Jr High and High School that made this athletically challenged nerd's life hell), satisfaction (when I think about all that I have accomplished in the past several weeks), and finally, empowerment (when I realize that I share a home with my biggest fan who never stops encouraging me and cheering me on. He is the best). Maybe sharing a little bit of this process with others isn't so bad after all.
My confidence level throughout this process has ebbed, it has flowed, and a couple of times it has evaporated into thin air. My very first practice was amazing. I jumped into an endurance test, completing 20 laps in 4 min. 35 seconds, safely under the 5 minute requirement. I left practice thinking I was some kind of speed demon. The next two practices were spent picking my ass up off of the ground every 3 minutes. I left the rink thinking I was crazy for even considering this sport and full disclosure, there may have been at least one tear shed on the drive home. I've had more good practices than bad and I'm trying to really focus on what I've accomplished each night.
In my Social Work Masters program, entire semesters were dedicated to Group Theories and learning how to facilitate cohesion within various types of groups. Scrap everything I learned there. Group cohesion happens when you show up for practice at 8pm regardless of the holiday or weather, sweat your asses off with 40+ other chicks who are skating around in their underwear and fishnets, and booty checking each other to the ground. You are all in it together. You all stink to high hell and you compliment each others' bruises at the end of the long night. I've made more friends in the past 4 weeks than I have in the past 4 years. Regardless of what our fate turns out to be in derby, just going through this experience together makes me predict that I will remain friends with many of these ladies (and gentlemen) beyond the rink.
I spend my lunch breaks at work obsessing over the skills set list. I highlight the ones that I need to work on, I cross out the ones that I feel like I am beginning to "master." The next day, I'm whiting out and rethinking my plan of attack for being able to complete these skills by the mid-October test. A nerdy perfectionist...that's just who I am.
So what I need to work on....CONFIDENCE! It's time to get over myself, take those falls, dish out those hits, and do it as if I've been doing it for years. My derby tights may be cute, but they will look a lot better with a Dead Girl uniform than collecting dust on the shelf of my closet. I can't give up...I have to make this league! Thanks everyone for encouraging me to share a little more about this process. Your support means the world to me.
This week has been a whirlwind of new experiences. I am officially a "Newly Dead" recruit for the Kansas City Dead Girl Derby. My first practice was on Sunday and my poor muscles are hating me. The pain is amazing and is a constant reminder of how awesome this experience is! Here are a few pics from my album
I recently found a path at my neighborhood park that is specifically for skaters and bicycles. "Wheels Park" has been my new home, nearly every morning at 6:30am. I'm working towards the all mighty goal of 20 miles per morning. So far....6 miles has been pushing it.
I wanted to share an iPhone app that I found that will track your progress through GPS. iSkate is my favorite new app and one that I certainly think that I will get a lot of use out of. It tracks distance, speed, calories burned, and elevation climbed during your trip. It is too good not to share!
Delna Lisetta Wempen, 82, of Minden, passed away on Tuesday, February 6, 2018 as the result of a motor vehicle accident in Franklin County. Funeral services will be held at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday, February 17, 2018 at St. Paul Lutheran Church in Minden with the Rev. Christopher Hazzard officiating. Interment will be held at the Upland Cemetery. Visitation will be held from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. on Friday, February 16, 2018 at the Craig Funeral Home in Minden.
Delna was born on April 16, 1935 in Minden, NE, the daughter of John J. and Lisetta (Nitzel) Lammers. She lived first three and a half years a half mile west of Upland, NE until moving Southeast of Minden where she lived at her current place since she was eight years old. She rode one of the first school buses that came out of Minden. She was baptized by Rev. Heintz at the Lutheran church in Upland and was confirmed at the St. Paul Lutheran Church in Minden by the Rev. M. Schabacker. After graduation from Minden High School in 1953, she worked for Warp Publishing for seven years, making “Warps’ Review” workbooks for 5th-8th grades. Delna played the accordion while her mother played the piano for the Schnoor Orchestra every-other Saturday night for 14 years at dances held in Kearney. She helped start the Miller Dance Hall in Miller, NE where they played for many years. Delna played accordion at KRVN radio and NTV when they first went on the air. It was at the dances she played at, that she met her husband, Henry W. Wempen, Jr. and they were married on October 18, 1959 at St. Paul Lutheran Church in Minden by Rev. Karl Baumgart.
The couple lived on the family farm with her parents, helping her father with the farm, who shortly after their marriage suffered a heart attack. Delna had been her Dad’s boy and enjoyed every aspect of farming and ranching. She had a good eye for farm animals and especially loved horses. She enjoyed custom trucking in Nebraska, Kansas, South Dakota and Colorado, and was very proud to actively hold a Class A CDL at the age of 82. She taught Sunday school for over 18 years and enjoyed cooking, canning, gardening and sewing. Delna and her family also had their own family band which played for many different occasions.
She is survived by her four children, sons, John Jay of Minden, Mark and wife Kristen Wempen of Pleasanton, Rex and wife April Wempen of Minden; daughter, LaFona Wempen and special friend Robert Lammers of Overton; seven grandchildren, Justin Dallmann of Smith Center, KS, Mitchell Dallmann of Upland, Sadie Dallmann and special friend Heath Shannon of Upland, Katie Dallmann and special friend Dillon McIntosh of Amherst, Jacob, Melody and Ashley Wempen of Minden; one great-granddaughter, Lily Dallmann; sisters-in-law, Beverly Wempen of Overton and Katheryn Wempen of Overton as well as a host of nieces, nephews, other relatives and friends.
She was preceded in death by her husband, Henry W. Wempen, Jr. and her parents, John and Lisetta “Sadie”, as well as an infant brother at birth.

When we have the first meeting with the couple the phrase we hear the most is: “We don’t understand any of this, we don’t know what is supposed to be done or what is mandatory to have”; indeed, it is not supposed for you to know, because in principle, you only marry once and is only mandatory what you wish to be. Anyway, there are a few names that you can “learn”, at least to be informed when deciding. We have created this small illustrated glossary to help you understand the “language” of weddings , and if you still have questions, we are glad to help. You can download and “study” your list and we will make sure it becomes reality!

Police are keeping a close eye on driving behaviour, with checkpoints around the island operating at random times of the day and night. 18042312
The bag was found later on in the day with a number of items missing including a cell phone and a watch. Police are currently seeking two young people seen swimming in the vicinity around the time of the alleged theft. The police say beach areas leave people vulnerable to opportunistic thieves, because of the cover that bushes and trees provide. They say no-one should take the risk of leaving items unguarded.
A man was forbidden from driving on Friday night after being breathalysed at a traffic stop in Nikao. Four people were also forbidden from driving on Saturday night, in similar circumstances. Police say the consumption of alcohol may result in the confiscation of keys, if a person is assessed as being a risk on the road. That applies even though drivers may be under the legal limit for breath alcohol.
Police officers also arrested two disqualified drivers for breaching their court orders over the weekend. One of them arrested appeared in court on Saturday and received a fine. The other was bailed to appear on Thursday.
A male also appeared in court on Friday, after being arrested for contempt of court. The man is facing charges of theft, dangerous driving causing injury, and possession of a substance. He has been remanded in custody and is set to reappear this Thursday.
On Saturday night, police officers were called out five times to deal with excessive noise complaints. Two of the complaints were in relation to a location in Takuvaine. Police also attended a family dispute that required the “relocation” of two people.
There was also an incident involving two motorcycles in Nikao on Sunday. Police say two males were traveling towards Avarua, when one failed to successfully overtake the other. They say the motorcycle that was overtaking clipped the other, forcing the driver to brake suddenly and lose control of their motorcycle.
The victim suffered minor injuries, which were later treated at hospital. Police say they will be talking to the other driver, who failed to stop and offer assistance.
There aren’t many nights that go by without me cozying up to a delicious drink. Sometimes its just a crappy beer, but many times I’m lustfully slurping a fine wine.

Art materials can be hazardous to our health. It is important for artists to educate themselves on the hazards of the tools and materials they use in their creative practice. While this post will focus mainly on the toxicity and hazardous content that makes up our creative materials, be aware that the creation of our work can cause health problems as well. Body positioning for extended hours, dangers of tools, and other elements of creating our work can be just as dangerous as the toxic components.
Art Materials Laws: Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act (LHAMA) passed in 1988 required manufacturers to post warning labels on their products based on voluntarily adopted standards. The law requires art supplies to be labeled if they could cause chronic health problems. Unfortunately, there is a big loop hole to his act. Manufacturers can avoid this by selling their product to a hardware store instead of an art store. So, picking up a few supplies from the local home improvement store can cause unknown hazardous exposure.
Live Work Dangers: Live-work spaces are great because they allow artists to save money by being able to work in the same space they live in. This also allows for artist commnal spaces, open studio events, and essential time saving. While there are many benefits to occupying a live-work space, artists who occupy these type of spaces can be exposed to these toxic materials on a 24-7 basis. This is pretty scary if you use toxic materials.
Basic Guidelines: Here are some basic best practices to begin a healthier studio practice. Most of these are pretty obvious but a good reminder:
Resources: Its important to read up on the health hazards associated with your specific creative practice. The U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has published a free guide to help artists and creatives learn about the hazards of art materials. You can access the free guide here Art and Health Safety Guide.
Below are some general creative health reading materials. Click on the images for links to each book so you can read more about this resource.

Other guests in our party had the seafood pasta and the Fettuccine Alfredo. All 4 dishes were served hot, well presented, and plentiful. Definitely we will be back!
Houston possess a plethora of parks and green spaces, but only in Smither Park, do dragons, bears, octopi, and guitar playing armadillos roam freely. Technically these creatures were formed by human hands out of recycled material, glass and tile but they fill this block on Munger Street in the East End with whimsical life.
A years-in-the-making project from the Orange Show Center for Visionary Art, Smither Park recently officially opened with a celebration honoring all the artists’ work and especially the lives of the park’s namesakes, folk art collectors and longtime Orange Show supporters John and Stephanie Smither.
Before the party began, I had a chance to walk among the mosaic animals and mirrored trees on a guided tour with Smither Park designer Dan Phillips. Though he immediately rejected my attempt to pin a renaissance man moniker on him, the artist and designer has at one point in his life also been a dance professor, cryptogram puzzle maker, antiques restorer, and nationally recognized builder and founder of Phoenix Commotion.
While Phillips and Stephanie Smither’s initial vision took root at the groundbreaking in 2011, Phillips has been a guiding presence the last five years as the park grew and blossomed.
“The idea was that I was able to dream my wildest dreams and then let reality beat us back into feasibility,” said Phillips of when Stephanie Smither first asked him to join the project. “My job was to come up with the concept and then herd a hundred cats through the development.”
The cats in this scenario are the nearly 300 artists who contributed to the creation of the park, and Phillips' herding continues to take the form of offering guidance and encouragement to help the artists focus their unique visions.
“I’ve been an ombudsman and a cheerleader. I try to just keep everything running smoothly,” he said.
Art blooms everywhere in Smither Park with almost every inch of concrete destined to be cover in mosaic images. All of the park’s main elements use recycled and sustainable materials and each feature has a distinctive place and function in the park, while creating a sense of play and wonder.
The Shell Plaza Walkways meander through the park parallel to the nearly 500-foot-long Memory Wall that stands as the back boarder to the park. Divided up into 60 panels for artists, volunteers and friends of the Orange Show to pay tribute to loved ones, remember beloved places or depict their dreams. Near the middle of the Memory Wall the white porcelain and ceramics tiled alcove of the Marilyn Oshman Meditation Garden offers visitors a space for quiet pondering and still contemplation.
The giant fish mouth, the Lindley Fish, anchors the park at one end. Designed and constructed by artist Matt Gifford the Fish serves as a bandshell for performances and concerts. In the middle of the park grows the four pillars of the covered Vinson & Elkins Pavilion. Each pillar shaped like a tree went to a different artist, and the structure will be available for rental for private parties and gatherings.
Designed by Dan Phillips, The Johnson Marble Tower is still under construction, but Phillips’s descriptions of this marble drop conjured up for me images of a part interactive sculpture, part Rube Goldberg Machine that will likely become a favorite for kids of all ages. After playing at the Marble Tower, a whole family might relax and fit together on the large bench swings.
Throughout our talk, Phillips continued to credit the park’s fruition to the vision and drive of Stephanie Smither, who envisioned the park as a tribute to her husband, but passed away herself in June of this year.
“It was a sad day when we lost John in 2002 and devastating when we lost Stephanie,” said Phillips but as he continued to describe the couple, I looked around and thought perhaps a bit of their spirit would live on in every blade of glass throughout the park.
“What was so much fun about John and Stephanie was that they were willing to entertain the most outrageous of ideas and had the resources to do that. If it appealed to them as an adventure, they’d do it,” he described.
Though now open to the public, some of the main features of Smither are still in sapling stages of growth, but that’s all part of the fun as volunteers, including those with no experience, can come on down and dig in every Saturday to help nurture the art of Smither. At the end of our talk, I asked Phillips if there will come a date when the park is complete and finished.
“Art takes time,” he said. “It’s a work in progress, but it’s a functional park. It will keep on growing and evolving.”

Steven Adams and the Oklahoma City Thunder has no trouble with the Washington Wizards on the road. And I refuse to let the ship sink, so as one of the captains on the team I put a lot of responsibility on my shoulders.
In an attempt to show a single thread of hope after seeing his team drop to 1-7, shooting guard Bradley Beal filled the leadership void in a post-game interview. "I still believe in these guys. Dwight was obviously a start to that".
The big Kiwi did not add to his efficient first-half haul on Saturday (NZT) as he spent most of the back end of the game resting up on the bench along with the rest of the Thunder's frontliners, with the job well and truly done over the opening two quarters. The team shot a blistering 57 percent from the field and 46.9 percent (15-of-32) from 3.
Mr Anderson's alleged attacker remains in police custody and is expected to be charged with murder later today. A fight broke out between two men in a reserve off Pavilion Street in Queenscliff early on Sunday morning.

"No", Wall said when asked if it feels any different this time around when compared to the previous bad start. "Like I've told you many times, I never worry and I mean it". "Until we figure that out, we're going to have these same problems".

Prevalent Learning Styles among Nursing and Midwifery Students and its Association with Functionality of Thinking styles and Academic Achievement a Study in Mashhad School of Nursing and Midwifery
Introduction: One of the most important factors related with student's thinking style and academic achievement is learning styles. The purpose of this study is to determine the most current learning styles among students and its association with functionality of thinking style and academic achievement in school of nursing and midwifery of Mashhad. Methods: In a descriptive cross-sectional study, 214 students of nursing and midwifery school in Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (MUMS) were selected through stratified sampling method. Data gathering tools were Kolb’s learning styles questionnaire (LSI) and functions of thinking style questionnaire and the research method was descriptive correlational. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (Pearson correlation coefficient, MANOVA, and x2). Results: Learning styles of majority of students in this study were absorbent. The results of X2 test showed that there were significant differences among the prevalent learning styles of total students (p= 0/000), but there was no significant difference between the prevalent learning style of male and female students (p= 0/14). In addition, the results of MANOVA indicated that there was no significant difference in academic achievement and functions of thinking style based on the student's learning style (p= 0/36). Conclusion: Considering the fact that learning styles appropriate with academic field could lead to students’ achievement and regarding that no significant difference was observed in academic achievement and functions of thinking style based on the student's learning style, it is recommended to educational administrators to take actions about enrichment of educational settings, teaching methods, and teacher evaluation.
Keywords: Learning styles, thinking style function, academic achievement, students of nursing and midwifery.

The normal and lateral line cycloid scales of the native species Garra rossica (Nikol’skii, 1900), one of the most common and poorly known cyprinid fish in south-eastern Iran have been subjected to the scanning electron microscopy technique in order to study their detailed structure. Normal scale below the dorsal fin showed a clearcut demonstration between the anterior and posterior region with the focus lying towards the anterior region that is covered by reticulate or honeycomb form structures with few mucous pores. There is a wedge shaped circuli only in the anterior and lateral fields which are partitioned by deep and narrow grooves called radii and run radially towards the focus. On the dorsal side, the anterior circuli bear numerous pointed lepidonts. In the posterior section, the scale has several rows of pigmented granules (tubercles) with different shapes from round to oval, semi oval and even oblong structure. The lateral line scale has a canal which characteristically lies along the anteriorposterior axis, with a wider anterior opening than the posterior opening which is hidden by an eyelike extension cantilevered over it. Although the scale of G. rossica shows the general structure of a cycloid cyprinid scale, the shape and size of lepidonts on the circuli crest, shape and size of tubercles on the posterior region and the pattern of reticulate or honeycomb that form structures in the focus region may provide more reliable taxonomic tools. The present analysis of scale morphology in G. rossica may be used in combination with other morphological and molecular data in a synergic approach to the phylogenetic and systematic study of the genus.
The majority of Antarctica is covered in a permanent ice cap almost 5 km thick in some places. However, Antarctica was not always a barren and frozen land. The discovery of fossil plants, reptiles, and marsupials of the same species as those found in other parts of the Southern Hemisphere indicates that Antarctica was once joined to the other continents and that its climate was once temperate. The Antarctic Peninsula, or Marielandia, currently has the mildest climate on the continent. It is here that Antarctica’s only two vascular plants grow, and it is here that wildlife such as penguins, flying seabirds, and seals are most plentiful. In addition to global climate change and the depletion of ozone over the south polar region, growing tourism to the peninsula may become a serious concern. Plants and animals of this region are highly adapted to the extreme and inhospitable environment, and thus, can be vulnerable to the slightest disturbance.
My commentary on the Bible's teaching that Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the Old Testament come in the flesh, and on Jehovah's Witness issues. I am an Australian evangelical Christian in my 60s and have never been a Jehovah's Witness.
Note: This uncompleted series became too `long-winded' and is now superseded by my new series: Jesus was executed on a cross, not a stake! #1: Introduction.
Many years ago, when I was still a relatively new Christian, a Jehovah's Witness told me that Jesus did not die on a cross but on an upright stake, because the Greek word translated "cross" in the New Testament primarily means "stake." I was taken aback by this,
[Above: Jesus `crucifixion' as depicted in Watchtower Bible & Tract Society publications, e.g. "Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life," 1995, p.67. Note Jesus' arms: 1. above His head; 2. transfixed by a single nail; and 3. the inscription above Jesus' hands.]
which I assume is the reason JWs do it: to shake a non-, new, or weak Christian's faith in the Church and so make the Watchtower Society seem to be a more reliable authority. And also to make JWs feel superior to ordinary Christians in having (apparently) deeper Bible knowledge.
However, I responded off the top of my head (which I assume was from the Holy Spirit-Lk 21:13-15) that it would not matter to me whether Jesus was executed on an upright pole, or on a cross: the important thing was that Jesus, who was God in human flesh (Jn 1:1,14; Col 2:9; Php 2:5-11), was executed in my place to pay the price of my sin (2 Cor 5:21; Gal 2:20; 1Pet 3:18).
Indeed the various evangelical Protestant churches that I have been a member of for the past 40 years have never made a big deal about the physical Cross nor its shape. The Church of Christ I have been a member of since 1994 does not have a cross atop its building and it has only a simple wooden cross in its chapel. Neither my wife nor I wear a cross, nor do we have one in our home.
So while the Christian Church would not have a major problem if it turned out that Jesus was not executed on a cross but on a stake, it would be a major problem for the Watchtower Society if the reverse was the case. This is because Christianity has never made a big deal about the physical shape of the wooden structure that Jesus was executed on, but the Watchtower has made a big deal about it.
But was Jesus crucified on a cross as the Christian Church has always maintained, or on a stake as the Watchtower Society claims? (emphasis bold mine):
"Jesus Christ did not die on a cross. ... [but] an upright pale or stake." ("What Does the Bible Really Teach?," 2005, p.205).
"Pontius Pilate then sentenced him to death on a torture stake. He was nailed to a wooden pole and hung there upright." ("Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life," 1995, p.66).
"Jesus was not executed on a conventional cross at all but, rather, on a simple stake" (Watchtower, November 15, 1992. p.7)
"The evidence is, therefore, completely lacking that Jesus Christ was crucified on two pieces of timber placed at a right angle" ("New World translation," 1950, p.771).
That this a major teaching of the Watchtower Society is evident in that: 1) it is about Jesus; 2) it is in its latest home study aid book for prospective new members, "What Does the Bible Really Teach?" (2005), and 3) it has been in the Society's publications since at least 1936, i.e. for more than seventy years. So if the Watchtower Bible & Tract Society is wrong on this teaching then, in addition to being a false prophet, the Society would also be a false teacher:
2Pet 2:1 NWT. However, there also came to be false prophets among the people, as there will also be false teachers among YOU. These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that bought them, bringing speedy destruction upon themselves.
This series of post will comprehensively examine that Watchtower Society's claim that Jesus was executed not on a cross but on a stake or pole, quoting from its own publications, in successive posts under the following sub-headings: #1 Introduction (this post), #2 Linguistic, #3 Historical, #4 Patristic, #5 Archaeological, #6 Pagan, #7 Biblical and #8 Conclusion.
To avoid unnecessary complexity, I do not plan at this stage to examine whether Christians should wear a cross or use a cross in worship. Not only is this a separate question from whether Jesus was executed on a cross or a stake, but also Christians who agree that Jesus was executed on a cross, can and do disagree on whether a cross should be worn and/or used in worship.
References cited will be hyperlinked to `tagline' quotes at the end of each post (emphasis italics original, emphasis bold mine). I hope to finish this series, appropriately, by Easter (Friday, 21 March).
"Despite the fact that Rutherford depicted Jesus on the cross in several of his books, he would in 1936 begin to change his position to what would become the current Watchtower Society position - that of the torture stake theory. This theory says that Jesus did not die on a cross but rather on a single upright post, hand over hand with a single nail through both hands. In his book Riches, Rutherford wrote, `The death of the perfect man Jesus would, in any manner inflicted, meet the requirements of the law, because death was the penalty inflicted upon Adam. Why, then, was Jesus crucified? Jesus was crucified, not on a cross of wood, such as is exhibited in many images and pictures, and which images are made and exhibited by men; Jesus was crucified by nailing his body to a tree' (p. 27). This torture stake theory, started by Rutherford, would be clarified over the next several decades. In 1972, the Watchtower wrote an article discussing Christian cross came to be accepted by professed Christians. After being led to adopt the cross as a sacred symbol, professed Christians began depicting the body of one crucified thereon.' They continue with `No Biblical evidence even intimates that Jesus died on a cross." (Awake!, 8 November 1972, p. 28)." ("Jehovah's Witnesses and the Cross," Watchman Expositor, 23 May 2007).
"THE cross is loved and respected by millions of people. The Encyclopaedia Britannica calls the cross `the principal symbol of the Christian religion.' Nevertheless, true Christians do not use the cross in worship. Why not? An important reason is that Jesus Christ did not die on a cross. The Greek word generally translated `cross' is stau-ros'. It basically means `an upright pale or stake.' The Companion Bible points out: `[Stau-ros'] never means two pieces of timber placed across one another at any angle ... There is nothing in the Greek of the [New Testament] even to imply two pieces of timber.' In several texts, Bible writers use another word for the instrument of Jesus' death. It is the Greek word xy'lon. (Acts 5: 30; 10:39; 13:29; Galatians 3:13; 1 Peter 2:24) This word simply means `timber' or `a stick, club, or tree.''" ("What Does the Bible Really Teach?" Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York: Brooklyn NY, 2005, p.205. Ellipses original).
"Jesus courageously exposed the hypocrisy of the religious leaders, and they sought his death. They eventually hatched an ugly plot that involved betrayal, improper arrest, an illegal trial, and a false charge of sedition. Jesus was struck, spat upon, ridiculed, and beaten with a whip designed to tear his flesh. The Roman governor Pontius Pilate then sentenced him to death on a torture stake. He was nailed to a wooden pole and hung there upright. Each breath was excruciating, and it took hours for him to die. Throughout that ordeal, Jesus maintained perfect integrity to God." ("Knowledge That Leads to Everlasting Life," [1984], Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York: Brooklyn NY, Second edition, 1995, p.66).
"Cross ... `No biblical evidence even intimates that Jesus died on a cross.' A 11/8/1972, p. 28 ... ... `So, the evidence indicates that Jesus did not die on the traditional cross.' A 9/22/1974, p. 28 ... `Jesus most likely was executed on an upright stake without any crossbeam. No man today can know with certainty even how many nails were used in Jesus' case.' WT 8/15/1987, p. 29 ... " (Reed, D.A., ed., "Index of Watchtower Errors, 1879 to 1989," Compiled by Steve Huntoon and John Cornell, Baker: Grand Rapids MI, 1990, pp.73-74. Emphasis original).
"FOR centuries multitudes have accepted the cross as a symbol of Christianity. But is it really? Many who have sincerely believed so are quite surprised to learn that the cross is not at all unique to Christendom. On the contrary, it has been widely used in non-Christian religions all over the world. ... The Bible shows that Jesus was not executed on a conventional cross at all but, rather, on a simple stake, or stau·ros'. This Greek word, appearing at Matthew 27:40, basically means a simple upright beam or pole, such as those used in building foundations.." ("The Cross-Symbol of Christianity?," The Watchtower, November 15, 1992. p.7).
""No Biblical evidence even intimates that Jesus died on a cross. Regarding the Greek word stau·ros' (translated `cross' in numerous translations), A Comprehensive Dictionary of the Original Greek Words with their Precise Meanings for English Readers states: `STAUROS .... . denotes, primarily, an upright pale or stake. On such malefactors were nailed for execution.' Similarly, the book The Non-Christian Cross observes: `There is not a single sentence in any of the numerous writings forming the New Testament, which, in the original Greek, bears even indirect evidence to the effect that the stauros used in the case of Jesus was other than an ordinary stauros [pole or stake]; much less to the effect that it consisted, not of one piece of timber, but of two pieces nailed together in the form of a cross.'" ("Use of the Cross," Awake!, 8 November 1972, p. 28).
"Matthew 10:38 - `torture stake' ... stau·ros', Greek; ... This is the expression used in connection with the execution of Jesus at Calvary. There is no evidence that the Greek word stau·ros' meant here a `cross' such as the pagans used as a religious symbol for many centuries before Christ .... In the classical Greek the word stau·ros' meant merely an upright stake or pale .... To such a stake or pale the person to be punished was fastened ... The inspired writers of the Christian Greek Scriptures wrote in the common (koi·ne') Greek and used the word stau·ros' to mean the same thing as in the classical Greek, namely, a stake or pale, a simple one without a crossbeam of any kind or at any angle. There is no proof to the contrary. .... The fact that stau·ros' is translated crux in the Latin versions furnishes no argument against this. ... A cross is only a later meaning of crux. .... The evidence is, therefore, completely lacking that Jesus Christ was crucified on two pieces of timber placed at a right angle. .... This is a revolutionary translation, we admit .... The passing of time and further archaeological discoveries will be certain to prove its correctness. ..." ("New World translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures," [1950], Watchtower Bible & Tract Society of New York: Brooklyn NY, Second edition, 1951, pp.768-769, 771).

When I started my blogs I was retired and living comfortably on my superannuation. So I had time to blog almost all day every day. But due to the Global Financial Crisis I am now working as a high school relief (aka. substitute, supply) teacher. So I have much less time to blog. However, because of the long school break from November to February there probably won't be any relief teacher work, so I should be able to restart blogging almost full-time then. I intend to continue with my "Was Jesus executed on a cross or a stake?" series then.
>Thank you so much for all your hard work and time. I look forward to seeing you in heaven. :) God bless.
Which reminds me that even the Watchtower's own New World Translation correctly states that "the Great Crowd" will be in Heaven (not on Earth as the Watchtower Society teaches):
Rev 7:9,15 NWT After these things I saw, and, look! a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes; and there were palm branches in their hands ... That is why they are before the throne of God; and they are rendering him sacred service day and night in his temple; and the One seated on the throne will spread his tent over them."
Rev 19:1 NWT After these things I heard what was as a loud voice of a great crowd in heaven. They said: “Praise Jah, YOU people! The salvation and the glory and the power belong to our God,
Mt 27:37 NWT states, "Also, they posted above his HEAD the charge against him, in writing: `This is Jesus the King of the Jews.'" (my emphasis).
If Jesus was executed on a single-beamed stake with His hands affixed above His head by one nail, as consistently depicted in Watchtower publications, then Mt 27:27 would say, "above his HANDS."
And in Jn 20:25 NWT, Thomas says, "... `Unless I see in his hands the print of the NAILS and stick my finger into the print of the NAILS and stick my hand into his side, I will certainly not believe.'" (my emphasis).
Again if Jesus was affixed to a stake by ONE NAIL, as per Watchtower depictions, then Thomas would have said, "print of the NAIL" (singular) not "NAILS" (plural).
This series "Was Jesus executed on a cross or a stake?" is proving too `long-winded'. I hope to summarise it in one post in the near future.

Not just cross,no physical object should be used in worship.Worship should be in truth and spirit(Holy Spirit).When we use some objects in worship,out of reverence,be it cross or an image of saint it deviates us from the worship in truth and spirit to the revered object-idol.Those who do idolatry will be condemned to eternal lake of fire and sulfur along with sexually immoral,liars,cowards etc(revelations21:8).Original pentecostal worship is how worship in truth and spirit should be done.
We should not give undue importance to weather Jesus died on a cross or a pole,although archeological and historic evidence tend to point towards cross.But the event that foreshadow crucifixion in the old testament when Moses raised a brass snake on a "pole",doesn't use cross,but a pole.The lie of JW is not about Jesus being crucified on a pole or a cross,but their teaching that Jesus is archangel Michael a created being .Bible teaches Jesus is word of God who existed from eternal past.
Disagree. Your larynx (voicebox) is a physical object which is used in worship when you worship God in song, for starters. Also a musical instrument is a physical object which is used in worship.
But if you mean that no physical object, including a cross, is ITSELF to be worshipped, I agree. But no Christian church that I am aware of worships a cross ITSELF.
>Worship should be in truth and spirit(Holy Spirit).When we use some objects in worship,out of reverence,be it cross or an image of saint it deviates us from the worship in truth and spirit to the revered object-idol.
As a Protestant I don't use a cross or an image in worship, but see above that your "When we use some [physical] objects in worship" is too sweeping because worshipping in song uses physical objects (our bodies, musical instruments, etc).
Also worshipping God by our offerings and partaking of the bread and wine of communion is using physical objects in worship. It is worshipping physical objects THEMSELVES that is idolatry.
>Those who do idolatry will be condemned to eternal lake of fire and sulfur along with sexually immoral,liars,cowards etc(revelations21:8).Original pentecostal worship is how worship in truth and spirit should be done.
Agreed, but "idolatry" in that context is the actual WORSHIP OF IDOLS (i.e. physical representations of God or gods) THEMSELVES, as stated in Exodus 20:4-5:
4 “You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me,
>We should not give undue importance to weather Jesus died on a cross or a pole,although archeological and historic evidence tend to point towards cross.
Agreed. But it is not CHRISTIANS who give undue importance to whether Jesus died on a cross or a pole. If it turned out that Jesus died on a single upright pole and not a two-beamed cross, it would not be a problem for me and other Christians I have talked to about it.
It is JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES who give undue importance to whether Jesus died on a cross or a pole. The Watchtower Bible & Tract Society has elevated it into a major doctrine since at least the 1950s that Jesus died on a single-beam stake, and not on a two-beamed cross.
And what's more they are WRONG. The evidence, including archeological and historic, is overwhelming that Jesus died on a two-beamed cross, not a single-beamed stake, which is yet another example of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society being a false teacher.
>But the event that foreshadow crucifixion in the old testament when Moses raised a brass snake on a "pole",doesn't use cross,but a pole.
"So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on a pole. And if a serpent bit anyone, he would look at the bronze serpent and live."
it doesn't say what sort of "pole" it was. It could have been a pole with a cross-piece to support the bronze serpent.
14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, 15 that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.
Jesus does not mention the pole, indicating that the only points of significance between Jesus and the bronze serpent was that: 1) they were both LIFTED UP; and 2) whoever BELIEVED in them would be saved.
>The lie of JW is not about Jesus being crucified on a pole or a cross,but their teaching that Jesus is archangel Michael a created being .Bible teaches Jesus is word of God who existed from eternal past.
Agreed that that is the major lie of the Watchtower, and of JWs who are deceived by it. The Bible teaches that Jesus is Jehovah God the Son come in human flesh (see my "Jesus is Jehovah!" page), but the Watchtower denies that, and instead teaches that Jesus is just an angel.
But in that they fail to "honor the Son JUST AS they honor the Father" as their own New World Translation says:
John 5:23 NWT: "in order that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He that does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him."
So, according to the JW's OWN BIBLE, JW's do NOT honor Jehovah God the Father because they do not honour Jesus His Son, "JUST AS," they honor the Father.
And it would be BLASPHEMY for Jesus to insist that He must be honoured "JUST AS" Jehovah God the Father is honoured, unless Jesus was Himself Jehovah God the Son.

I doubt that you will post this, but just in case you do. My brother you are in serious error. Number one and most important His name is not Jesus, it is Yahusha, and Yahusha is Yahuah, not Jehovah. He was not exicuted on a cross but a stake or pole. If you want to see proof of this please visit http://www.fellowshipoftheway.com/is-the-cross-a-lie I pray that you will see the real truth.

>Number one and most important His name is not Jesus, it is Yahusha, and Yahusha is Yahuah, not Jehovah.
We only have Jesus' name in Greek (Gk. 'Iesous), in the New Testament, the Jewish historian Josephus who wrote in Greek, and other first-century writings which are all in Greek. So it is just speculation what the EXACT spoken name of "Jesus" was.
In the three occurrences in the New Testament where the name "Joshua" is translated: Lk 3:29; Acts 7:45 and Heb 4:8, it is the same underlying Greek word 'Iesous.
"yehoshua'-yeshua` designates ten Hebrew leaders (ISBE, III, pp. 1622, 1743) from Moses' successor Joshua (KJV, Jehoshua in Num 13:16; I Chr 7:27) to the post-exilic high priest Jeshua (Ezra 3:2; Neh 12:10). The former's name was changed from the Hiphil infinitive, Hoshea, `salvation,' to Joshua, with its deeper spiritual connotation of `Yahweh (is) salvation' (Num 13:8, 16). Both men are called `Jesus' in Greek (Acts 7:45; I Esd 5:48), i.e., yeshua` is our Lord's Hebrew name, `for he will save his people from their sins' (Mt 1:21). This may be a shortened form with the divine element omitted, meaning `he will save.'" (Payne, J.B., 1980, "Yahweh," in Harris, R.L., Archer, G.L. & Waltke, B.K., eds, "Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament," Moody Press: Chicago IL, Vol. I, p.211).

Again, you (and the Watchtower) are WRONG. Jesus WAS executed on a two-beamed cross and not on a single pole. See my unfinished series, "Jesus was executed on a cross, not a stake!".
And also see in my post on my The Shroud of Turin blog, "My critique of Charles Freeman's "The Turin Shroud and the Image of Edessa: A Misguided Journey," part 5: "The Image of Edessa" (1)", where I have a photo of a stone lion drinking fountain in ancient Edessa (a major centre of early Christianity), today Sanliurfa in Moslem Turkey, which has an unmistakable cross carved into the stonework, which has escaped the Moslem destruction of almost all of Edessa's Christian past.
And as my caption states, being part of a stone lion, which was " the symbol of the Abgar dynasty," the Christian part of which began with Abgar V (AD 13-50) and the dynasty itself ended with Abgar IX (212-215), therefore it "must have been erected before AD 215" (and likely before or soon after AD 50):
"[Above: A stone lion, the symbol of the Abgar dynasty, bearing a Christian cross, in Sanliurfa (Edessa), which must have been erected before AD 215: Wilson, 2010, plate 15b.]"

Jelqing, like most penile stretches, overstretches the nerves and tissues in your penis.Techniques include pills, hormones, massage, stretching, inflation, incision, injections, and implants.This is an already well-known method of increasing penis size but it has also been found to help with lasting longer in bed.The Jelq gorges the chambers of the penis and when they are repaired they are able to hold more blood.
Men that have heard of jelqing exercises might not be aware of the fact there are quite a number of different techniques can be employed.Jelqing is a basic exercise, which uses a firm, stroking motion to force nutrient-rich blood into the penis.Penis enlargement, or male enhancement, is any technique aimed to increase the size of a human penis.Jelqing is a simple and effective natural penis enlargement method that yields results when done consistently, safely and properly.
Member exercises is a modern member enlargement method to reach your desired (realistic (or unrealistic)) member size.
When done repeatedly it is said to increase not only length of the penis, but also girth or thickness.
Many people recommend jelqing and the ways on how to do jelqing exercises to increase the size of their penises.
In addition to being effective as a lone penis exercise, it is often part of much more rigorous natural penis growth package out there.
Power J Gym is without a doubt the best Penis Enlargement Exercise system and Jelqing Device on the market.It involves squeezing the penis with 2 fingers and stroking it from the base, away from the body.I jelq 4 month from year ago and seem my dingdong stay same size.Jelqing is a manual penis enlargement exercise that does not require any devices or machines.
If this occurs to you, then cease jelqing until your erection goes away, then restart.It seem my penis look way way bigger on flaccid state and 100% full erection does increase like 0.25 inches in length and 0.125 in girth.
Other products are no competition, no matter the metric: Quality, design, method, results, fast gains, comfortability or ease of use.Normally, the width and length of an erect penis is not the same size after a male passes the puberty until he reaches the age of 50.
I got a 3 day a week fullbody workout split, which is always followed by a jelqing session then masturbation.

1 Hear this word that the LORD has spoken against you, O sons of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt (see Ex. 12:51,&c.), saying,
3 Can two walk together, except they have met together by appointment [of time and place]? (This is the 1st of 5 parables. The answer to each is self evident.)
4 Will a lion roar in the thicket, when he has no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?
5 Can a bird fall in a net upon the earth, where no snare (or, trap. Gin is short for the Old French engin, which is from ingenium; hence, something ingenious) is for him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?
6 Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not run together? shall there be calamity (evil inflicted in judgment) in a city, and the LORD has not done it? (With the true meaning of 'evil' there is no need to do violence to the Hebrew to defend Yehovah's righteous dealings.)
7 No: (cp. Job 31:18. Mic. 6:4. The reason follows and is explained) for the Lord GOD does (Heb. 'sah = work, execute [Ex. 12:12. Num. 5:30; 33;4. Deut. 10:18; 33:21,&c) nothing, but He reveals His secret counsel to His servants the prophets. (As He did to Abraham, His 'prophet' [Gen. 20:7] in Gen. 18;17, &c., and has since done by His prophets. Cp. Gen. 6:13. Ps. 25:14. John 15:15.)
8 The lion has roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD has spoken, who can but prophesy? (God speaks through the prophets. See Heb. 1:1.)
9 Publish in the palaces (see 1;4) at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, 'Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and oppressive acts (oppressed by violent and forcible extractions. See Lev. 19:13. Deut. 24:14) in the midst thereof.'
10 For they know not to do straight-forward, says the LORD, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces."
11 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; "An adversary [shall come] there (cp. 2 Kings 17:3,6; 18:9,10,11) and shall be even round about the land; and he shall bring down your strength from you, and your palaces shall be spoiled."
12 Thus says the LORD; "Just as the shepherd rescues (like a brand plucked from the burning) out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or the tip of an ear; so shall the son of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in [the corner of] a couch. (I.e. luxuriously. Cp. 6:1-4.)
13 Hear you, and testify in the house of Jacob (i.e. the whole of the natural seed. See v.1), says the Lord GOD (Adonai Yehovah), the God of hosts (The Elohim of Sabaioth.),
14 That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him (see Ex. 32:34) I will also visit the altars of Beth-el: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the earth.
15 And I will smite the winter house (cp. Jer. 36:22) with the summer house (cp. Judg. 3:20); and the houses of ivory (put for the parts inlaid, paneled, or overlaid with ivory. Cp. 1 Kings 22:39. Ps. 45:8) shall perish, and many houses shall have an end, says the LORD.

As the Aam Aadmi Party government struggles to cope with pressure from private power distribution companies and another tariff hike, sources said the government could consider another subsidy. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced a 50 per cent cut in subsidy in slabs upto 400 units days after assuming power.
Sources in the power industry believe that the major issue to deal with is the shortfall of cash in the system. However, according to Kejriwal, it was "blackmail" by private discoms. He even announced that the Delhi government would "cancel licences" of the discoms if they carried out power cuts across the city.
Meanwhile, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) served notices of power suspension from February 11 to the two BSES discoms on payment related issues.
On Saturday, Kejriwal said the CAG audit into the finances of the discoms would reveal the truth. "Power companies claim that they do not have money, but where has their money gone? The CAG is trying to find their money and the truth will come out in the CAG's report. After the CAG's report, we will get to know whether they are really facing a financial crisis," Kejriwal said.
A senior government official said another power subsidy, to tide the recent tariff hike, was possible. The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) on Friday announced a 6 per cent (BRPL), 7 per cent (NDPL), and 8 per cent (BYPL) hike in power tariff surcharge.
"The government is not involved in power tariffs. But we are considering another subsidy to help domestic consumers," a source said.
Power department sources also said power regulator, DERC, was the only authority that had the power to cancel licences. "The regulator is an absolutely independent body, and the government cannot influence it. It is also between the DERC and the discoms to arrange the money to pay NTPC in the next 10 days. The DERC, which issues the licences to the discoms, also has the responsibility to ensure quality supply of power," a senior power department official said.
Former power secretary Shakti Sinha said the government has no power to cancel the licences of the discoms, which is a very long drawn process.
"The government may recommend such a thing to the regulator, but it does not mean much. Cancellation of licence is a very long process. The regulator has to present the various points on which the discoms failed. The discoms can also present a case on points where the government has failed in the partnership," Sinha said.

It d be a huge loss for Western Union if bitcoin cut into its business: Africans throughout the diaspora send home $32 billion a year, according to the World Bank. All together we’ve had hundreds of requests from cities across the country.

He trekked throughout the world in an attempt to identify the best treatment for her.

Because these exchanges store cryptocurrency on behalf of their users, they are lucrative targets for hackers. Even if the pizzeria accepts bitcoin for payment, Ivan needs to pay tax in euros.

Mr. Jake Fogg of Internet Deputy, addresses the senators who claimed that they would not vote for a complete repeal of Obama Care.
Special Counsel Robert Mueller never had a warrant or subpoena when engaged in a mass seizure of all the Trump transition team emails.
According to a recent legal analysis by Constitutional Attorney Robert Barnes of Law and Crime, this seizure violated the Fourth Amendment as well as attorney-client privilege protections.
The Mueller team has made the excuse that use of a government server waived any right to privacy to any email sent or received over that server. However, the Supreme Court (City of Ontario, Cal. V Quon, 560 U.S. 746(2010)) made it clear that “individuals do not lose Fourth Amenment rights” merely by using servers, offices, or equipment provided by the government.
Robert Barnes explained another precedent, Leventhal V Knapek, 266F.3d 64,74(2d Cir. 2001), “held that an employee has a reasonable expectation of privacy of the contents of his computer even when given specific notice the computers could not be used for personal purposes and the individual had authorized disclosure for technical and maintenance audits.”
Specifically government employees’ emails are protected even when sent over government email servers(Re County of Erie, 473 F.3d 413(2d Cir. 2007).
But attorney-client privileges are broader, according to Barnes. In Curto v Medical World Communications(E.D.N.Y. 2006) courts ruled that an ex-employee could assert attorney-client privilege against employers who tried to invoke emails contained on company computers even with the notice that documents stored therein were not protected.
There are several court precedents that cover, and should have prevented Mueller from what he did. Apparently seizing every single email from the Trump transition team, Mueller didn’t even attempt to categorize or search for specific emails related to the probe itself. This is exactly what the Supreme Court ruled against.
The emails that Robert Mueller seized were not emails by government employees, but by private individuals to be stored on a government server temporarily and publicly declared “private materials” by the National Archives.
The government email system is a tool that, in this case, was to be used to help the President transition into office. Barnes also points out, “The security and efficacy of government-owned servers for transition employees are not intended as a trap for the unwary to forever forfeit their privacy and privilege rights in their communications.”
While president transition teams have played an ambiguous role in U.S. government, it has always been the case that since they are in place before the inauguration for the president-elect, they are not considered a federal “agency”. Therefore, according to Professor John Turley, the National Archives recognizes transition all team materials therein as “private”.
Using the government email system as a trap for those targeted by the deep-state holds the potential for serious consequences. At the very least it undermines the Constitution. It also might encourage government employees to use private servers for government affairs as did Hillary Clinton, who by doing so for criminal reasons, increased the threat to the national security of the U.S.
Essentially what Mueller did violated the law by intentionally skipping over the court, the grand jury, and government imposed limits. The fact that Robert Mueller is seasoned in his field and knows better is alarming.
Reminiscent of J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI, Mueller’s blatant disregard for the Constitution and privacy involving highest office of the land proves that any citizen of the United States is at risk of having private property seized by those who may disagree with the Deep-State Media Complex.
Every year the 4th grade at Seton Catholic School packages Kids Against Hunger meals as their service project. This year we had an enthusiastic group that packaged 6,532 meals to feed the hungry.
Some time ago, raw materials continued to decline, and prices are slowly picking up. This has a great impact on the plastics flexible packaging industry. In particular, the prices of CPP and PE in the market are relatively turbulent. We will be cautious when purchasing related materials. This will cause the situation in the production process to be interrupted and unable to be delivered. The impact is still relatively large.
In addition, the plastics flexible packaging industry in the market now needs to reduce prices based on the price of raw materials for better development. As for the ratio of price reduction, it needs to be calculated based on the prices of raw materials and related labor costs. In fact, this situation will eventually lead to a decrease in the profits of the plastic flexible packaging industry during the development process. It is indeed better for companies to better understand the market conditions in order to better develop in the future.
In view of this situation, companies should make assessments based on market forecasts and their own development, and design appropriate solutions or measures in order to solve the existing problems. The overall impact of the problem is indeed more, in the development process more attention should be paid to their own corporate development; timely adjustments based on market conditions can protect the company's rapid profitability.

I'm not sure what I expected from this book. From the synopsis it sounds really interesting until it gets to the part about Carey entering high school. When I read that part it sounded like something average because in my head I'm thinking that I've read something like this before. I was pleasantly surprised! If You Find Me was heartbreaking but hopeful.
When I first started reading I thought I would end up hating Carey's voice because she didn't always use proper English and I tend to get annoyed with characters that speak like that really quickly, but I actually really enjoyed her voice. It didn't sound forced and it really matched her character.
Carey and Nessa's story was so heartbreaking, but predictable. I knew what had happened to them in the woods after Carey relived a memory about the men that her mother brought home, but that didn't lessen the disgust and horror I felt when Carey finally came clean. What happened to them was terrible and so realistic that I could imagine two children living out in the woods and going through the same thing that they did.
Even though I really enjoyed Carey's story, I still had a few problems with it. I don't understand how two girls that lived in the middle of nowhere could be drop dead gorgeous without even trying. Both Carey and Nessa are beautiful compared to the other characters. I felt like Ryan and Carey's relationship didn't develop enough for me to be truly invested in them. They had been childhood friends but that doesn't mean that they should automatically fall in love. It just seemed really strange that Carey trusted Ryan so easily after everything that the men in the woods did to her, even though she had known him from her life before the woods.
I also really didn't like how Carey treated Delaney. To Carey, Delaney is the evil stepsister, just because Delaney wants nothing to do with her. Honestly, I felt bad for Delaney because she was used to being an only child and now she's one of three. That's a little hard to adjust to and of course she isn't going to automatically like Carey, but Carey didn't seem to see that until a little over half way through the book.
There are many reasons why we experience body pains and aching and few of these reasons are due to our extensive exercise or we just have a really exhausting week. Once we feel these pain and ache, we immediately seek for a good massage or body rub. The basic difference between a massage and a body rub is that a massage is performed by a professional therapist while body rubs can be performed by anyone by just using a body rub ointment to help ease the pain.

Massage services are the same for all companies engaged in this type of industry, but to experience the best massage, you will have to be ready with your money. A massage parlor that offers a higher rate for their services simply means that they offer more on all of their services. Therefore, the place you are entering is really comfy and the masseurs they have are all experienced. There are also other services that the company offers aside from the common services of a massage parlor. It is a fact that if you really want to satisfy the need of your body to soothe away the pain and aching, you need to experienced the best and more relaxing kind of massage. If you want a more accurate assessment of the massage parlor regardless of how expensive it is, you can always review the comments coming from the clients of the company. It is also an advantage if you choose a massage parlor that offers a 24/7 service and it is better if they also offer a home service for you to avoid the hassle.

To begin with your career in photography at the right path, you need to gather more information about it first. Gathering information would provide you guidance on the right steps that you need to take. Researching can be done through the internet, talking to professional photographers, as well as reading some books about the subject.
Even if you are still at the starting point of your photography career, it is best to purchase the type of digital camera that you really want. You should purchase something that can provide you with the kind of pictures that you want. By using a camera that provides quality photos, you would become more motivated in taking more pictures with it, even if you are still trying to learn about it.
Having a tripod can provide you with lots of benefits, as far as taking pictures is concerned. It is one of the things that you need to invest on, in order to have quality landscape shots. Aside from that, it would also help you in taking glorious pictures of sunset or sunrise.
Timing your shots well is one of the keys in taking beautiful pictures. This is actually one of the reasons why some professional photographers would suggest beginners in the field, to make use of filmed cameras at the start. This is because, using such types of cameras can help a person develop a good habit in timing and choosing his shots, due to the fact that the film limits it.
There is always a tendency for a beginner to stick on taking pictures of his subject head on. If you are doing that, you may be preventing yourself in finding the best angles. Thus, it is a good idea to try out different angles first. Try to be taking the picture from the top or from below. By doing that, you can have different perspectives of the scene.
Looking for candid shots can actually provide you with more opportunities of taking the best shots. When you check out different photos, you will find that some of the best ones are those that are taken without the subjects looking at the camera. Capture scenes where people are doing their usual things, and you will see how natural it would become.
UV filters can provide your camera with the protection that it needs, in order to stay in top condition. Place the filters in front of your camera lenses, so that your lenses would be protected from scrapes or knocks. With that, you can be assured that your lenses last longer.
Camera lenses are quite expensive these days; and, having a good number of them would offer you more when it comes to taking pictures. However, if you want to save on cost, then find a friend who has the same brand of camera that you have. Aside from that, have an agreement with him in purchasing different lenses, so that you can simply swap lenses whenever you need to.
Even with the use of a tripod, there is still a possibility that you would get blurred shots. This can be due to the way you press the shutter button, in taking the pictures. To get around that, all you actually need to have is a remote. Aside from that, you can also make use of your camera’s delay timer.
10. Make use of your mobile phone’s camera if you are trying to scope for beautiful landscape shots. So you won’t forget them.
Scoping for great landscape shots can become a fun activity, especially if you won’t keep on forgetting those that you want to visit later on. To prevent that from keep on happening, you can always make use of your mobile phone’s camera for it. By doing that, you would be able to remember where you want to shoot your landscape scene next, by simply checking your phone.
11. How to make sure that your lenses would not knock against each other while being put inside your bag.
Camera lenses do not come very cheap these days, which is why you need to take care of them properly. To make sure that they won’t destroy each other while being put inside the bag though, you can use your hiking socks for them. All you have to do is to cut the shocks into its proper sizes. Just make sure that the socks are cleaned so that your lens would not get dirt on it.
Checking out your work after a few weeks that you have taken them, can provide you a new feeling for the photos. Aside from that, it would also give you the opportunity to see what you did right, and what you did wrong. More importantly, even if you did really well with them, you can always use them as your guide to make improvements.
There are times when you want to capture an image or images of subjects that are erratic or moving fast. An example of this would be your pet dog playing around the garden. To make sure that you can capture a decent picture, simply make use of your camera’s continuous shooting mode. With that, it would take a number of shots in just a second, which would give you the chance to catch a good shot.
If you want to become a wedding photographer, you want to start it right, so that you can get more clients. Staring out right in photography means gathering more information about it. However, you should also practice more; and, one of the best ways to do that is to volunteer as one of the photographers for your friend’s or relative’s wedding celebration.
Lenses are available in different models these days. Some are big, while some are small. Keep in mind that such camera accessories are quite pricey. To make sure that you would be purchasing the right kind though, you can always rent certain types of lens for a few days first, so that you can check out their many functions and advantages, which should help you make the right purchase.
If you are trying to sell certain products online and you want to take pictures of them, you should have a good light box for it, so that your pictures would really look good. A homemade light box can be made with a cardboard box and a tracing paper. With your homemade light box, you can take quality pictures of the products, which would help in selling them faster.
In most cases, you would usually take a picture standing up. Try lowering it down for certain types of shots, so that you can also explore different angles. Checking out different perspectives would provide you with more options on how you want to go about in taking a picture of your subject. Aside from that, lowering down your camera is one of the best things to do when your subject is small.
To gain more motivation in taking beautiful pictures, one of the best things that you can do with them is to sell them on stock photography websites. These sites can expose your pictures to people who are looking for the best images for their marketing efforts. In other words, if companies find that your pictures are in good quality, and they are applicable to their products, then they would purchase it.
You need to protect your camera’s LCD screen at all times, since it is where you would check the images you captured. To achieve that, you can simply make use of LCD screen protectors for them. They can ensure that your LCD would be free from scratches and dirt. Thus, with them, you can maintain the quality of your digital camera for a longer period of time.
Capturing light for the picture that you are taking is considered by some as an art. To manipulate light, you need to consider the different sources of it, such as the sun, flashes, and lamps. You have to know that these different sources may also need different tools, in order to take advantage of them, such as the reflectors, diffusers, and snoots.
When you check back on your pictures, it is best to check out the camera settings when you took them. Some of the setting you want to know about regarding this would include the aperture, shutter speed, and such. To do that, refer to the exif data of the pictures. By doing that, it can help you take note of the things you have done right or you have done wrong, and make improvements.
This idea may seem a bit funny for some. However, using your flash when you are taking pictures outside is actually a good idea. It is often referred to by professionals as “fill flash”. Using your flash outside can help light up your subject even on a sunny day, especially if the light is coming from behind them.
Setting your white balance to daylight and not to auto is a good idea when taking pictures of sunrises or sunsets. Oftentimes, when there is lower amount of light, your camera may not provide you the best photo for it. Thus, it is best to set it to daylight, or better yet, put the white balance mode to manual.
Backing up your images is one of the most important things you need to do. You can easily do it by purchasing an external hard drive for your computer. By backing up your images, you are assured that they won’t get lost. Back up your photos every one or two weeks, and store the it in a place that is safe.
Managing your hard drive space is very important, since it is where you would store your images. Save space on your hard drive by spending some time in sorting out the images. Select the images that you really want to keep. After doing that, all those that you have not selected should be deleted, so that you can save more room for future photos.

You can finally identify and block spam calls on your iPhone. Finally!!! Apple’s been a bit behind the curve for some time now, but not any more! Now, your iPhone can block spam calls… but how? Well, you came to the right place. To start, you’ll need the Hiya app downloaded from the app store. Got it? Great. Let’s get started. Without further ado, allow me to introduce you to your iOS 10 User Manual for Hiya.
Enable Hiya by going to: Settings –> Phone –> Call Blocking and Identification. Move the toggle next to Hiya from disabled to enabled.
Now, let’s say, you don’t want to receive spam (annoying) or scam (fraudulent) calls. We don’t blame you. Hell, that’s why we’re here. Hiya 3.0 gives you the ability to automatically block all nuisance calls through the Options tab.
Have some particularly annoying people you want to keep away? Now, you can now create your own custom blocklist. Add any number or contact to this list and Hiya will block it.
Note: There are some limitations with Apple’s CallKit Extension. One being that we cannot hang up on a number that is on your block list; the call will go directly to voicemail. You won’t know the call came through unless they leave a voicemail. Once added to your blocklist, their contact information will appear like this:
Search for any number and Hiya will show you the caller ID and spam details (if any) for that number.
Whether your next call is from someone in your contacts, a caller identified by Hiya, or a caller currently unknown to Hiya, learn as much as you can through the caller details page.
Ever get a call that didn’t leave a voicemail, that left you wondering, “What if… just what if… that call was important? Should I call them back?” Save yourself time (and potentially money) by viewing a number’s spam level and recent reports.
Start making calls from Hiya instead of your phone dialer and it will warn you of outgoing calls that could be possible scam or spam. The more you use the Hiya dialer, the better your live caller ID experience will be.

“Hiya, a company which makes apps to screen and block robocalls, and tracks about 3.5 billion calls globally every month, released a report Tuesday that identifies the most pervasive phone scams. According to the Robocall Radar report for September 2016, an estimated 984 million robocalls were made to U.S. mobile phone users during the month, averaging to about 4.5 calls received by every cell phone in the country that uses Hiya’s services,” reports International Business Times.

BoI Gave Industrialists N112bn Loans in 2017 – Report |BoI Gave Industrialists N112bn Loans in 2017 – Report |
A total loan of N112.5bn was provided by the Bank of Industry to finance the industrial sector of the economy in the 2017 financial period.
The Chairman, BoI, Aliyu Dikko, gave the figure in a presentation made at the 58th Annual General Meeting of the bank held in Abuja on Thursday.
He said despite the challenging operating environment, the lender recorded huge improvement in its financial performance.
For instance, Dikko stated that the total assets improved by 4.5 per cent from 682bn to 713bn between 2016 and 2017, while the group’s total equity also rose to 241bn in 2017 from 219bn in the previous year.
Similarly, he said profit before tax also increased to 26.3bn from 16.9bn in the period under review, representing a growth of 55.6 per cent.
Dikko said, “The bank’s disbursement profile in the year also improved significantly to 112.5bn from 65.9bn that was achieved the previous year.
“Lending to the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises also increased significantly to 29.5bn when compared to 8.2bn in 2016.”
Also speaking at the event, the Managing Director, BoI, Mr. Olukayode Pitan, stated that the bank doubled its loan disbursement rate to the industrial sector.
When asked for the loan repayment rate in view of the huge non-performing loan portfolio in the banking sector, he said the BoI had one of the least NPL ratio in the industry.
Pitan stated, “In the last one year, we doubled the amount of loans we gave out to small and medium enterprises. We also basically intervened in a lot of industries and they benefitted from the loans of the BoI in the last one year and we have given out over N100bn in loans.
“The repayment of our loans is very good. If you look at our annual report, you will see that our non-performing loans are less than five per cent and there are many reasons responsible for that.
“We give out loans that are secured by bank guarantees. In the SMEs space, their repayment has been good and we are working very closely with the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Ministry of Finance to ensure that we put something in place that can be like a guarantee so that we can reduce the risks in that space and make more banks to lend.”
He described the outlook for 2018 as very positive, noting that the bank was ready to give out more loans to boost the industrial sector of the economy.

The snood - the long fleshy appendage above the beak, is what erects, becoming red as it engorges with blood. (The snood photo we reproduce here is from the Homegrown Hobby Farm blog.) Rebecca T. Kimball and Edward L. Braun of the University of Florida explain at least part of the story, in their study:
Species within the Phasianidae (pheasants, partridges, guineafowl, grouse and turkeys) are well known for extreme ornamental traits, including fleshy regions around the head and neck…. Many species in the avian order Galliformes have bare (or ‘‘fleshy'') regions on their head, ranging from simple featherless regions to specialized structures such as combs or wattles…. [The] ability to erect rapidly the fleshy traits is restricted to a single, well-supported lineage that includes species such as the wild turkey Meleagris gallopavo and ring-necked pheasant Phasianus colchicus.

I watch little TV these days but, the other night, due to a cricked neck and an inability to lie down, was forced to stay up beyond my bedtime, idly thumbing the remote. I inadvertently channel-surfed onto Danny Baker's Great Album Showdown. What a fab programme. Even better, guest Kate Mossman's choice of Queen's Sheer Heart Attack as her favourite platter. Queen fans have had to spend much of their adult life in the closet. This was a liberation.
Sheer Heart Attack was the first album I ever bought and remains, I think, the best of the band's classic Seventies period. Their second(!) album of 1974, their third in total, it marked the transition from dungeons'n'dragons fantasy to baroque pop-rockery, most famously — but not exclusively — in the shape of Killer Queen, their first global single smash.
There's a major case of attitude to Sheer Heart Attack. Quite acerbic. Brian May was coming back from a serious illness which had kiboshed the band's inaugural American tour. His playing here (Brighton Rock, Flick Of The Wrist) has never been more raw, and which is why, for me, SHA has the edge — no matter what the polls say — over the over-produced and slightly saccharine A Night At The Opera. Indeed, I rank the latter below the rougher-hewn A Day At The Races (saw them at the Southampton Gaumont, May 1977) and News Of The World (Stafford Bingley Hall, May 1978).
Hi there. I'm a writer — journalist, author, screenwriter, lapsed broadcaster and now blogger. I work largely in the world of the arts, usually film. Here's a post of recent pieces and other musings. Feel free to comment. JD

Welcome to Functional Medicine Update for July 2015. This is the third and the final of our three-part series on functional oncology and I think we’re very privileged to have Dr. Tom Brown as our clean-up hitter in this three-part series. I think you will find Dr. Brown’s insight, experience, and vision as to where this field is going to be extraordinarily important, both from a mindscape way and also from a clinical utility way. So with that, let’s move to our discussion with Dr. Brown.
I’m very happy to say that not only do we have an extraordinary treat with our clinician/researcher this month, but also I’m a little bit parochial in that we have an expert who is actually local to our area—Seattle, Washington—who I believe, as of 2013 when he came to join the Swedish Cancer Institute as its new Executive Director, brought a tremendous expertise to the community and really poised this area to continue to be a development center of excellence in the area of cancer therapy.
So let me say a little bit about who you’re going to be hearing from, Dr. Thomas Brown. Dr. Brown, when he chose to take this responsibility as the Swedish Cancer Institute new Executive Director, brought a tremendous background. He came from the University of Arizona, where he served as a professor of medicine and their Chief Operating Officer at the University of Arizona Cancer Center. Prior to that he was a professor and vice president at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and while on the faculty at Duke University, he led the development of a multidisciplinary gastrointestinal cancer program and a regional, community-based clinical trial consortium.
He also holds a Master’s in business administration from Rice University, and was a graduate of the Medical College of Virginia. He completed his internal medicine residency at the University of Florida and his fellowship in medical oncology at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. His clinical practice and research focus has been on therapeutic development in gastrointestinal malignancies. His professional and academic interests include healthcare policy and international healthcare delivery systems, and he served on numerous institutional and national/international committees and boards, and among numerous honors I think one that stands out is he was selected as a Jones Scholar while at Rice University and was selected also for inclusion in the Best Doctors in America since 1998. So that’s quite a portfolio and I probably just tipped the touch of the iceberg of the many things that Dr. Brown has accomplished in his years of service.
We were very fortunate to have Tom as a presenter at our Thought Leaders Consortium in 2014 in collaboration with Lee Hood’s Institute for Systems Biology. Tom laid out to the audience, during his presentation, a really wonderful vision of where cancer therapy is going and what the status of cancer research and development is in the global community and also specific here to what’s going on in Seattle at Swedish.
Tom, it’s with great privilege that we want to thank you for giving your time to Functional Medicine Update and bringing your wisdom and insight to us. Recently in Lancet—I think this was the March 21st issue in 2015—there was an editorial that was titled “Cancer: The Elephant in the Room,” in which they really went back and reviewed what is the status of cancer incidence in the United States and the world at large, and where are we heading, and reviewed or reflected on the Bailar and Smith paper that appeared many years ago that said that we were losing the war on cancer, but now there is evidence to suggest that we’re making some progress. It’s still—according to this editorial—an elephant in a room that requires more and more understanding and appreciation and respect for what’s happening.[1] Can you kind of tell us what is going on in the field of cancer incidence and therapy in terms of its prevalence and concern today?
TB: Well, Jeff, first of all good morning and it’s a pleasure to be speaking with you today. The overall perspective in terms of the challenge that cancer represents I think is best thought of in terms of the evolving demographic. That is, cancer is—in many ways—increasing in prevalence. The outlook for many cancers, though, is improving, even cancers with advance stage. Of course part of what has happened over the recent decades is that illnesses that have tended to be major public health issues (certainly in the realm of infectious diseases and more recently in the realm of cardiovascular diseases) have had an increasingly more positive outlook. Certainly in the case of infectious diseases there have been major strides over the decades and that has led to an aging demographic where cancer has, in many ways, become one of the major public health issues, if not the major public health issue, and this is playing out not only within the United States, but on a global level and obviously it’s an emerging issue in the developing world. So I would agree that cancer and the resources that are deployed to address the cancer challenge are, as you say, the elephant in the room in many respects.
JB: Kind of fueling this discussion—maybe even bordering on debate—is a recent paper by Tomasetti and Volgelstein that has gotten quite a bit of press, I think both in the medical world and maybe even in the healthcare consumer world, and that was the publication recently that suggested that cancers really are all spontaneous and it’s just kind of the Monte Carlo bad luck of the draw—there’s really nothing that one can do in terms of modulating, to any great extent, the appearance of cancer; these just appear statistically randomly. That caused quite a bit of controversy in the literature. I’m sure you’re familiar with this paper and the argument.[2] Do you have a thought about that whole concept?
TB: Well, I think that it’s clear, based on the available evidence, that there are both important biological factors as well as important environmental factors that lead to cancer risk and to cancer. I think you would agree that there is no debate in certain realms with regard to certain environmental factors, for example tobacco, tobacco products, the impacts of unhealthy diets (whether one is talking about a high fat diet or other examples). And of course conversely the positive impact that activities such as exercise can have on both cancer incidence and the outcome of cancer interventions once cancer is diagnosed. Those examples are but a few salient examples amongst many examples of how there are certainly events—whether environmental or biological—that impact cancer risk/cancer occurrence and the outcomes once one is diagnosed with cancer, so I think that would be a clear objective statement against the notion that this is simply a matter of random chance.
JB: So when one is—as you are—in a position of managing a very complex, multi-headed organization in the Swedish Cancer Institute, how do you balance the obvious primary focus, which is therapeutic intervention needs, against this concept of prevention, which obviously is another part of the story that relates to these induced forms of cancer from various environment and lifestyle factors?
TB: I think, Jeff, that really brings us into the notion of what many refer to as personalized medicine. Some others use terms such as targeted therapy or precision medicine, amongst other labels. We prefer the term personalized medicine because it has the dual connotation—the double entendre, if you will—of on the one hand caring for the whole patient and their family, their support group, and then on the other hand, addressing the individual biologic parameters that are at the core—the mechanism—of carcinogenesis, so that those two concepts are not contradictory in any way. They are integrated and they address not only the issues that relate to treating existing cancer, but—from our perspective—both the caring for the whole patient as well as attending to the biological phenotype or fingerprint of one’s cancer or the patient themselves. Those issues relate not only to the management of active cancer, but to the entire arc of experience that one might have with regard to cancer, to include early diagnosis, screening, prevention. So again, we consider those two concepts inexorably linked, as one might observe in the world around us.
JB: Well on the side of good news—and there is, fortunately, I think, good news in this whole area that we’re talking about—I recently read this paper that appeared in the Lancet titled “40-Year Trends in the Index of Survival for All Cancers Combined and Survival Adjusted for Age and Sex for Each Cancer in England and Wales, 1971-2011: A Population-Based Study,” and one of the summary statements, which I think is very encouraging, and I quote: “These findings support substantial increases in both short-term and long-term net survival from all cancers combined.”[3] In this case, this was done in the British Isles in England and Wales. I believe that this data also translates over the United States as well. So that sounds very encouraging. Are we moving, with this improved survival, to cancer as another form of chronic disease? Are we seeing the transition?
TB: I think as a practicing medical oncologist I have observed over the recent decades, as have my colleagues, that it is becoming more and more common to have people with active cancer that is incurable living for extended periods of time. Of course, the focus for those individuals is that they have as normal a quality of life as possible. So the number of people who are living under those circumstances as opposed to succumbing to the cancer in a short period of time is increasing. And yes, in many disease types the notion of advanced cancer as a chronic illness is a reality. A common example would be either a metastatic breast or a metastatic colon cancer, where it is not unusual for patients to live for many years even though their diseases are incurable. And it’s not unusual, increasingly, to see cancer patients who succumb to illnesses that are not related to the cancer and not related to the therapy for their cancer. Clearly that’s somewhat of a victory. I think that all of us would agree that the best way to cure cancer is to not develop it in the first place and therefore the emphasis on population health, on wellness, on prevention as well as screening and early detection, remains so important. We are making very considerable advances in both the management of potentially curable cancer once it is diagnosed as well as the long-term management of advanced cancer, but our collective desire would, of course, be to prevent cancer as much as possible.
JB: I had the good fortune of being one of the people that sat for three nights in a row so six hours over those three days show of The Emperor of All Maladies, Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee’s literation of his book in a TV special format. I found it an extraordinarily well done public information series. Of course I love the book, too. I was worried that I was going to be disillusioned when I saw the video portrayal, but I thought it was very, very well done. One of the things that struck me was this inflection point that is occurring right now in understanding cancer at the cellular and molecular level and at the immunological level and the development of this cancer atlas, which seems like it is a very big step forward in us getting our arms at least around the landscape of cancer. Could you tell us a little bit about that?
TB: There’s no question that the revolution in cellular biology that began in the 1950s with Watson and Crick and then subsequently has evolved in what some consider a very slow manner but it’s been a very impressive manner to where we are today, which is understanding, in many instances and in the case of cancer, understanding the details of the molecular mechanisms that take one from a normal cell to a cell with uncontrolled growth. To understand the gene-related steps, whether it be mutations within the DNA sequence or abnormalities in the RNA expression or resultant abnormalities in protein expression, mostly in all cases ending in some perturbation of protein expression, these steps are being understood in the context of both carcinogenesis (what leads to the causation of cancer) and then likewise into possible interventions that might overcome those abnormal steps. And for many, this is still seen as the future. The reality is—to use the hackneyed expression—the future is now, in that we have real-life examples of where this type of information leads to practical steps in the management of our cancer patients.
JB: Being one arm’s length away from really understanding what I’m seeing because I’m still on a learning curve, when I look at this cancer atlas, which has really started to catalogue specific genotypic mutations that are associated with specific kinds of cancer, the list looks very, very long, but it appears as if there are specific genotypes, certain mutational frequencies that are much more prevalent than others, which—then—probably is where a lot of the action must be going on as it relates to development of new therapeutic agents that would modulate those specific hotspots. Has this concept really started to pan out as we start seeing how this leads into personalized cancer care?
TB: Absolutely, and as you’ve heard me say before, Jeff, I think the best way to reflect on these changes is to look at how cancer in general has been classified or categorized over the many decades. So how have we generally approached our patients? We have generally approached them by the organ site of origin. We’ve organized patients, basically, on whether they have colon cancer or lung cancer or breast cancer. And I do feel that within the next 10 to 15 years we will be looking back at that lengthy period of time somewhat quizzically and thinking that it was interesting that we were treating patients based on that type of organ-of-origin classification as opposed to looking at the unique molecular phenotype or molecular fingerprint of one’s tumor and ultimately at the person themselves. Again, one might have a patient with so-called colon cancer who has a molecular phenotype or molecular fingerprint to their tumor that is very similar to someone who has clinical lung cancer, so that increasingly we’re being focused on the common mutations, the common changes in protein expression, the common epigenetic changes, the common immune-related dysregulation that might characterize a certain tumor or set of tumors as opposed to the organ site of origin, and that’s the true revolution in the way that we think about cancer.
JB: Yes, I think that you explained that very, very clearly and it seems that that is a huge paradigm shift, a huge move forward in, as you said, personalization, precision, however you want to term that. I saw a paper just recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association that was titled “Association of Type and Location of BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 Mutations with Risk of Breast and Ovarian Cancer.”[4] For me this was a very interesting article because I’d actually never thought about the diversity of different mutations that can occur within the genes that regulate BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 expression, and that they may have different penetrants into disease and they may have different therapeutics for their management depending on where those mutations occur within BRCA-1 and 2. This is just an example of a more general theme. Am I heading in the right direction in the way I’m interpreting this article?
TB: Right, well, part of what you’re touching on, though, is a very important subject for clinicians to reflect on, and that is we have gene alterations, mutations, and other molecularly based changes that occur in germ line tissue that is, by definition, inherited at some level, and then we have the similar changes that can occur in somatic tissue or non-germ cell tissue, and, for example, tend to happen in tissues that then become cancerous, effectively being associated with the patient’s tumor, which is more often than not a set of somatic changes, non-germ-cell changes, as opposed to germ line changes. I think that what we will increasingly see is some convergence of those two variants. And another way of expressing that is those who are familiar with the role of genetic counselors know that genetic counselors, almost by definition, spend the majority of their time addressing issues for patients and their families related to germ line molecular perturbations, for lack of a better euphemism. Increasingly, though, I believe—certainly this is gradually becoming the case at the Swedish Cancer Institute—the genetic counselors will also become involved in working in a multi-disciplinary team fashion with patients and their families along with the provider team in addressing non-germ-line molecular perturbations. So that, again, it’s important to recognize the current division between germ line molecular-based events and somatic non-germ-line molecular-based events.
JB: So when we take a lot of these discoveries and advancements in understanding about the molecular and cellular etiology of cancer and we translate it over into how does this drive new potential therapeutics, it appears as if we come back—in part, at least—to the immune system, saying, “Well, if there are ways that we could alert, activate, or mobilize the immune system to recognize the friends from the foes more effectively, and we could activate the cataloguing of immune cells for immunotherapy in such a way as we can induce their activity against the right cells that we might have a whole new breakthrough in cancer therapy. What’s the status right now as we see this advancing frontier of consideration?
TB: Well, there’s no question, Jeff, just as there has been a renaissance in what’s viewed as targeted therapy or molecularly target-based approaches, there has been a long-awaited, foreseeing of immunotherapeutic approaches. That’s no accident. Much of the understanding of molecular biology has, as its endpoint, the understanding of proteomic changes that are tied to changes in DNA and RNA, thus it’s not surprising that that clarity in terms of mechanistic changes that lead to cancer has also informed immunotherapeutic approaches. It is also true that as we find more effective systemic therapies that are not immune-based that allow for lowering of the tumor volume, that in theory at least, immunotherapy becomes an even more attractive approach to addressing low residual volume disease, something that we all recognize occurs naturally when one’s immune system can often manage low volumes of malignant cells. So, again, I think that the evolution in our understanding of the human genome and the related RNA protein and epigenetic changes has informed immunotherapeutics to some degree, but also the proliferation is not an exaggeration. The proliferation of active therapies in advanced cancer have opened the door, so to speak, to the role of immunotherapy in terms of addressing lower volume disease.
JB: So it sounds like the toolkit is expanding for the field of oncology, and we didn’t really even talk yet about advances being made in surgical oncology, which are tremendous advances there for debulking tumors and getting rid of cancer at the organ, tissue-specific level. So if we go back to this inflection point that you and I were discussing earlier, which is starting to look at the unique genetic personality of tumors versus just their histological definition of their site of origin and their grading in terms of staging, how is the insurance industry, Medicare, the government viewing next-gen sequencing and actually getting this information that starts our information moving forward in this direction?
TB: Well, of course, it is a rapidly evolving field in terms of the science, and in fairness to everyone I think first of all something we haven’t talked about is the acculturation that is necessary amongst providers, amongst physicians. This is a very different way of thinking about illness and of thinking about therapeutic opportunities for patients, so it’s not surprising that the traditional reimbursement system has likewise had challenges in figuring out how to reimburse. Initially reimbursement has been—and to some degree is still being done—on the basis of individual mutations that might have a code and a charge attached. As we enter into organized panels, there are actually codes that have been produced for certain panels, really based on panel size. But in general the federal system, CMS, does not yet have charges attached to those codes. I do believe that probably within the next 6 to 12 months this will be evolving. On the one hand, third party payers are somewhat concerned about the proliferation of this type of testing. I think, though, that as the field unfolds that we’re finding it is an opportunity to, again, focus—target—the way we approach patients, both in their evaluation and in the use of specific therapies. I believe that in the relative short run we’ll find that the molecular phenotyping of tumors and of the patient themselves will lead to greater value in healthcare. Now that’s arguably a hypothesis at this point, but I’m very optimistic about this revolution in the molecular understanding of carcinogenesis as leading to a more value-oriented approach to cancer care.
JB: You said something there that I had never thought about that I think is quite fascinating as it relates to these panels that associate themselves across a number of different genes, and that leads one to start thinking about moving away from the one-disease-one-drug mentality into a systems biology thought about cancer, because now we have multiple drugs often being used for the management of cancer like we do with HIV or with Hep C. It’s not like a one-hit treatment because of the complexity of these conditions, so we’re moving from what may be the foundation of the ICD-9 codes and considering independent diseases that all had singular etiologies and have one drug to treat them to a new model that’s really a systems-based model that’s going to require not only a lot of revolutionary thinking, but also procedural organization delivery in terms of how this gets translated into patient management and reimbursement. Am I far away from what’s happening or is that part of the story?
TB: No, Jeff, you’re right on the mark. For example, we’re using a highly actionable, meaning that the gene alterations that we’re looking at (the mutations) have practical steps in terms of commercially available therapies or therapies that can be used off-label for the set of gene alterations that we’re looking at in our panel at the Swedish Cancer Institute. We’re currently using a panel of 68 gene alterations. We’re about to go to a panel of more than 160 gene alterations. There are other commercially available panels that are at least twice that size. The point is that ultimately—and again, in the not-too-distant future—we’re likely to be using, routinely, whole exome sequencing, where one is looking at the broad array of active regions in the human genome, and in addition looking at the downstream expression that results from those changes in DNA, so looking at RNA expression or RNA sequence changes, and in turn looking at the further downstream protein changes that include epigenetic changes, and we haven’t gotten into other areas, like biome changes that can occur in areas like the intestinal tract, etc. So there is gradually, then, a proliferation of data that needs to be put into context, and obviously in some ways it’s the task of finding the needle in the proverbial haystack and there’s only one way to do that in an organized and disciplined manner, and that is with sophisticated IT informatics platforms. Over time, these platforms need to be integrated into the standard work flow, and what I mean by that is into the standard electronic medical record. That is the challenge, because as our audience knows, providers are increasingly tasked with a range of responsibilities that include activities tied to direct medical care, but also activities that are more distant, tied to things like reimbursement or other regulatory issues. And it’s imperative, as the data analysis becomes more challenging, to have this incorporated into the EMR through decision-based tools—that is, tools that enable decision-based medical practice, incorporated into the normal workflow. There are examples of these tools emerging. Clearly, on the one hand, one has to organize the complex medicine that is coming from the patient who is sitting in front of you. One the other hand, you have to put that individualized information in the context of the medical literature’s whole and the context of the experience of other similar patients. Again, there are tools that are emerging to facilitate that process.
JB: That was a beautiful summary explanation for a very complex area, which I’m sure we could have spent hours talking about and we still wouldn’t have had a complete answer but that was a wonderfully succinct summary. I’d like to ask one last closing question which I believe is probably on the minds of a lot clinicians as it relates to patient management in the oncology area. This really comes out of a recent Time magazine article in April 2015.[5] The cover issue was about the juxtaposition of two women of about the same age who had the same diagnosis of cancer—a glioblastoma. One was in a more rural area of the country (I think it was North Dakota, actually) and was being seen at the regional medical center there in North Dakota, and the other woman with glioblastoma was in a more metropolitan area that had access to a large cancer research teaching and therapy center. The question that was raised in the article—I mean, there were several questions, but one that I think that was the dominant question—was is there an advantage if you are close to a major metropolitan center where you have access to not only genomic profiling but also, then, experimental drugs and drug trials that are ongoing that might have new therapeutics that are related to your specific mutational type of issue—does that give competitive advantage to individuals that are in centers where that type of research is going on, or is it just asking questions for which you have no answer that produces anxiety and so it’s better not to ask the question as it relates to genomic profiling? That was kind of the theme of the article. Do you have an opinion as to how we’re managing this issue?
TB: Well, Jeff, you’re touching on a subject that for me, personally, is one of the key challenges of modern healthcare, whether one is talking about within the United States or globally, and that is access. And the point I would like to make—you were framing this rhetorically in the context of geographic distance—I would argue that yes, geographic distance can impact access so that the short answer to your question is yes, there is some advantage to being close to an urban location where you are more likely to have tertiary quaternary centers that offer these higher level technologies. On the other hand, as you and I know there are socioeconomic barriers that may have nothing to do with geography. You might be living within an urban center but still not have access to a certain level of expertise or the nurturing supportive care that is required because of issues that relate to lack of insurance, or lack of other resources (transportation, etc.). So that these wonderful technologies can be available to us, but they might as well be nonexistent if there isn’t the attendant access for the individual patients. So I think this is very important as we roll out new advances in healthcare and in the case of cancer care to be sure that we’re working on a population-based approach that addresses both metropolitan areas as well as rural areas, and obviously—again—this is another very complex subject that has rather complicated solutions. One of the things that we are striving for in our personalized medicine program is to provide at least universal access within our patient population, so that there aren’t defined financial barriers to accessing this technology. It’s being done in the context of an IRB-approved protocol. We’re attempting to translate the consent forms in the common non-English-based languages that are found in our immediate population. So again, I think that access, which can come in many forms, not just geographic distance but can come in the form of socioeconomic barriers, is a key issue.
JB: Thank you. That was a very, very important and moving discussion for us all to consider. Thank you very much. I guess I do have one other quick last question and that has to do with your view as to whether you feel this technology that we’re seeing emerge to quantitate things that were previously only qualitatively understandable, as we get deeper drilling into genomic aspects, whether this technology can find a potential application as we move forward in its understanding and in the informatics area and its analysis into the quantitation of prevention as to really precisely designing personalized prevention programs as well as personalized treatment programs. Do you see this as something down the road in our future?
TB: Well, Jeff, as you know from my earlier comments and also from earlier discussions that you and I have made, I feel very strongly about this point. There are many who think of molecular phenotyping of tumors and of patients as being primarily directed at selecting a particular therapeutic intervention, usually a drug—an agent—whether it be an immunotherapeutic agent or a more traditional molecularly targeted agent. But the truth is there is ample evidence now that this molecular phenotyping can be just as importantly applied to the areas of cancer control, so we’re talking again about early diagnosis, prevention, and screening. And effectively assessing risk, whether inherited risk in the context of germ line changes or acquired risk in the context of non-germ line mutations that occur that might lead to either a defined risk of cancer or clearly to the emergence of cancer through a pre-malignant condition. So yes, I feel that this type of molecular fingerprinting, as the lay expression is often applied, will apply to the entire arc of cancer experience to include simply assessing population risk, and this is where the value proposition is for this approach, and there’s an interesting contradiction in this in that on the one hand we’re increasingly talking about population health (wellness on a population basis), but the way this is being applied is by recognizing the individuality that expresses itself through unique biologic changes in an individual and in an individual’s tumor, and through that individualized understanding, be more effective in the way we apply resources to the entire population.
JB: Well, Dr. Thomas Brown, I can’t thank you enough and I think the Swedish Cancer Institute and Seattle and the local environment is very fortunate to have you as the executive director of the institute. Your vision and this broad landscape that we’ve had the privilege of discussing with you demonstrate both breadth and depth. It’s been a really exciting conversation for me and I’m sure all of our listeners are taking away a lot of news-to-use. Thank you so much for your vigilance and your leadership and we look forward to following what’s going on with you and the institute and thank you for the time you spend with us today.

August's job gains were revised up from 270,000 to 286,000 and the change for September was revised down from 134,000 to 118,000. Meanwhile, the U.S. trade war with China poses a risk to further gains and companies may be slowing capital investment.
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Sales are brisk for Mega Millions tickets across the country as people dream of winning a $400 million jackpot.
Lottery officials in Virginia, the lead state for the Mega Millions game, say sales are expected to reach $104 million for Friday night's drawing since the last drawing Tuesday. That's about five times the sales when the jackpot is $15 million, the starting point after a jackpot is won.
Mega Millions officials will meet Friday morning to decide whether to increase the jackpot ahead of the 11 p.m. Eastern time drawing.
Analytics-as-a-service, or analytics job service, is emerging as a new paradigm for enterprise data analytics. These services are motivated by the fact that setting up and running data analytics is a major hurdle for enterprises. Although platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS), and more recently database as a service (DBaaS) have eased the pain of provisioning and scaling hardware and software infrastructures, users are still responsible for managing and tuning their servers. A job service mitigates this pain by offering server-less analytics capability that does not require users to provision and manage servers. Instead, the service provider takes care of managing and tuning a query engine that can scale instantly and on demand. Users can get started quickly using the all familiar SQL interface and pay only for the processing used for each query, in contrast to paying for the entire provisioned server infrastructure irrespective of the compute resources actually used.
At Microsoft, SCOPE is an analytics-as-a-service which is used for internal data analytics. SCOPE is deployed over hundreds of thousands of machines, running hundreds of thousands of production analytic jobs per day that are written by thousands of developers, processing several exabytes of data per day, and involving several hundred petabytes of I/O. SCOPE users are not required to manage or tune their hardware and software infrastructure, and they concentrate only on their processing logic. However, the shared nature of SCOPE job service across several users and teams leads to significant overlaps in partial computations, i.e., parts of the processing are duplicated across multiple jobs, thus generating redundant costs. The goal of CloudViews is to automatically detect and reuse overlapping computations in the SCOPE job service, while allowing users to write their jobs just as before, i.e., with zero changes to user scripts.
Description Alonzo sends a poem to Will Carleton for his critique. Bragdon admits the poem has its flaws but that it was written in 15 minutes.
transcription Rondeau I dream of a palace of gold; Of wedges of shining ore; Of heaps of silver so bright and cold Man�s heart need not wish for more. Of the joys this wealth may procure; Its respect which through time has stood; I compare with the ills which the poor endure And I say to myself ��tis good.� * * * * * * I dream of the �spirit of fire� In Genius�s breast instilled; I see the thrill of its high desire For the aim yet unfulfilled. I see it in triumphs hang. When the nations own its will And, moved by the strength of its magic power, I say- �this is better still.�

By means of a visual feedback technique, human subjects were trained to make large conjugate cyclorotary eye movements at will. The range of movement increased with training at a rate of approximately 0.8 degrees per hour of practice, reaching 30 degrees at the end of training. Photographs recorded the ability to make voluntary cyclofixations at any amplitude within the subject's range. Cyclotorsional pursuit was also trained, with ability increasing with greater amounts of fisual feedback. In addition, torsional saccadic tracking was trained, showing a magnitude vs. peak velocity relationship similar to that seen for normal saccades. Control experiments indicate that all of these movements were voluntary, with no significant visual induction. With extended practice, large torsional movements could be made without any visual stimulation. The emergence of voluntary torsion through training demonstrates that the oculomotor system has more plasticity than has generally been assumed, reopening the issue as to whether other movements could also be trained to alleviate the symptoms of strabismus.

I can't be the only person who worries about the distance my tea has to travel to reach me. We hear a lot about food miles these days but it's important to remember the drink miles too. Black tea isn't something I could ever give up completely but I can certainly cut back. The problem is what to replace it with?
If you want to be really environmental and even mitigate some of the damage done by the tea you do drink then you could grow your own alternatives.
Creating a tea garden is incredibly easy, even if you don't have much space a couple of pots on a window sill will go a long way to meeting your needs. Most of the plants commonly used in tisanes need very little care and attention and once established in your patch will keep you well supplied for years to come.
Perhaps the two most rewarding plants to grow are mint and camomile. They both produce delicious, popular teas, give a far better result when picked fresh and grow easily and abundantly. Camomile in particular can be a weed, in my experience the best way to cultivate a huge crop of it is to try and keep it out of a garden! Growing your own gives you the chance to experiment with different varieties and to try other herbal infusions as well. Lemon balm and lemon verbena are both extremely good. You're also likely to find a surprising number of possible tea sources already growing in your garden. Nettles are hardly likely to be missed and the resultant tea is a good cure for hayfever.
If you want to produce a true tea garden why not incorporate a seat in the middle to sit and enjoy the fruits of your labours and reflect on the fact that every cup of home grown tea you drink is a good deed for the world.
Victoria Chavez, owner of PureLife Organic, displays PureLife products in her shop located at the Cotton Exchange in Wilmington. Chavez uses recipes passed down from her grandmother to make herbal remedies and has started selling to stores around the country.
When Victoria Chavez fell ill as a child, a visit to her grandmother’s house trumped sitting in a waiting room.
“Every time I got sick, she used to pull out this little box of herbs or literally go to her backyard and start picking out the herbs and plants,” Chavez said.
Herbalism – using natural products for medicinal purposes – would years later become the basis for PureLife Organic, Chavez’s store at 317 N. Front St. in the Cotton Exchange. While Wilmingtonians have been trying out her skin care products and herbal tinctures for years, customers up and down the East Coast are beginning to see the PureLife label on the shelves of their local health food stores.
In 2013, Chavez began wholesaling some of her products, handmade in Wilmington since she opened shop in 2007. Products in her Miracle Skin Relief line of balms, soap, shampoo and ointment ship out to stores in Maryland, Virginia, Florida and elsewhere, as do a variety of her tinctures.
Chavez stresses that the tinctures are not traditional medicine or FDA-reviewed. Some are based on her grandmother’s recipes or of Chavez’s own creation. Her migraine tonic contains feverfew and peppermint, while “Tummy Bitters” is made with chamomile and ginger, among other plants.
“I tell (customers), ‘I’m not your doctor,’?” she said. “I’m here to make you feel more comfortable. … I’m not here to cure, treat or diagnose a problem, and if you keep on being sick, you need to see a doctor.”
Wholesale broker Megan Schlicht said in the year and half she’s worked with Chavez, they’ve gotten PureLife products into nearly 10 shops, such as Salud Healthy Pantry in the wealthy Fairfax County, Va., community. Chavez said another broker sells to Florida stores with plans to expand to Georgia.
“Our independents around here, they like to support small businesses like themselves, and especially support local,” said Schlicht, who operates out of Baltimore and West Virginia. “You set up appointments and go in and present the product. We have to kind of look at their shelf space and what else they’re selling. … Luckily her product is something that’s more widely accepted everywhere because everybody’s going to get bug bites or poison ivy or scratches.” Schlicht said in the coming year she’ll be negotiating to get PureLife goods into East Coast chain stores, such as MOM’s Organic Market with locations in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington, D.C.
For Chavez, getting calls from customers states away can be surreal. Most of her products were designed with Wilmington in mind – she created “Brain Formula” after a customer who attended Cape Fear Community College asked for an alternative to chugging Red Bulls to stay focused.
“It’s just weird because I’m used to seeing everybody face to face, knowing them, talking to them,” she said. “But it’s nice to see that the stores that carry my product – they believe in my product just as much as I do.”

Beautiful design on a soft viscose/linen fabric that will hang beautifully. This fabric is discontinued, once our stock is sold no more is available.
All our curtains are handmade locally in Scotland. The following guide will give you all the information you need to measure for them. Please contact us if you have any queries.
Measure for your curtains using a metal/wood ruler instead of a cloth one as cloth tapes can stretch over time.
If possible, fit your curtain track or pole before taking measurements, as you will need to measure the width of this rather than your window.
Consider extending the pole/track on either side of your window. This will allow room for the curtains to pull back neatly and will prevent loss of light to the room.
Measure the length required from the point indicated below (at the base of the ring) to where you want your curtains to finish.
If you are having eyelet or tab top curtains, measure from the top of the pole (as shown below) to the required finished length.
Measure from the top of the track to where the curtains are to finish. This will ensure the track is entirely covered by the curtain.
The finished length of your curtains is a personal style choice. However, here are some guidelines to help you decide.
Below sill - measure to approximately 15cm below the windowsill. If you have a radiator, consider allowing a few cementers for clearance.
Floor length - measure to the floor. If your floor is uneven, consider taking an average length or contact us to discuss in person.
However, if you fancy something different, just contact us and we'll be happy to discuss your requirements.
Triple pinch pleat is a more formal/decorative heading style suitable for use with poles and tracks.
We offer handmade pinch pleats or standard pinch pleats, both with a depth of 13.8cm. The standard pinch pleats are made using a heading tape, but the tape will be pulled up and pleats stitched before the curtains are delivered unless otherwise agreed.
Our cartridge pleats are made using tape with a depth of 9cm. Cartridges are spaced at regular intervals across the curtain width. These pleats are particularly useful when curtains are required to stack back neatly.
Curtains are hung from a pole by evenly spaced fabric tabs made from the same fabric as the rest of the curtains. Please remember that the curtain pole should extend at least 30cms on either side of the window to allow space for the pulled back tabs, and should be fitted at least 15 cms above the window.
These curtains have a strip of stiffener sown into them to create a clean straight topline to the curtains. Each curtain is fitted with eyelets regularly spaced across the full width of the stiffener.
Eyelets are available in a choice of colors and sizes. We recommend that for poles up to 30mm in diameter, a 40mm eyelet should be used. For poles with a diameter of 30-40mm a 50mm eyelet is used and for poles with a 40-55mm diameter, we recommend a 66mm eyelet. A minimum of 4cm clearance is required above the pole for the curtain to move freely.
Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee where each stripe or pattern repeat will fall on a hanging curtain. This may result in some parts of the pattern being more visible than others.
Please also be aware that seams may fall within the pleat/eyelet or in the space between pleats. Feel free to ask us if you need further advice.
We can also provide cushions, tiebacks, valances, bedspreads, tablecloths etc in a variety of sizes and styles.
Lining curtains extends their lifespan. It protects them from damage caused by sunlight, ensures that the fabric hangs properly and gives a professional finish. We recommend that all curtains are lined, but can make unlined curtains on request.
At County Fabrics we offer premium crease-resistant off-white or ivory lining as standard. However, we can provide quotes for a full range of coloured linings.
Bespoke linings: Surprise your neighbours! Why not line your curtains with a funky fabric that looks great from the outside? This is a great option for door curtains.
Blackout lining: Blackout lining greatly reduces the amount of light coming into a room and is perfect for children's bedrooms. Remember though that light may still come into the room round the sides and tops of your curtains. Blackout lining also improves the thermal performance of curtains.
Interlined curtains: Interlining is a layer of fleecy material sandwiched between your curtain fabric and the lining.
It is very popular as the extra volume adds luxury to the finished curtains at low cost. Interlining also offers additional protection from fading and enhances the curtains' thermal performance. All of our interlined curtains are hand stitched in Scotland along the side and bottom seams.
Many companies offer curtains made with bonded interlining. This means that the lining and interlining are attached to the curtain fabric by means of an adhesive. Usually, curtains made with bonded interlining are machine sewn.
At County Fabrics we are passionate about quality and believe that curtains hang far better when separate lining and interlining are used. This avoids the stiffness that can come with adhesive.

Covenant of Grace Bible Church is an elder-governed, independent assembly of believers with no denominational ties. We are an evangelical Bible church, which believes in the sole sufficiency of the Word of God to guide us in matters of faith and practice. We also rejoice unapologetically in the sovereign grace of God which has granted to us repentance toward Him and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ who alone is able to wash away our sins by His shed blood. Finally, we are a family of believers who have covenanted together for the purpose of glorifying God by pursuing Him through Christ Jesus as our greatest treasure and pleasure in life. To God be the glory forever and ever.
We are a Bible-believing, God fearing, Christ-centered, Holy Spirit empowered, reformed evangelical, non-charismatic, visitor-friendly church that emphasizes the authority, sufficiency, and necessity of the Bible for all of life.
Covenant of Grace Bible Church is a nondenominational Bible-believing and teaching church comprised of baptized believers whose passion is to glorify God by enjoying Him as our greatest treasure in this life.
We are a community of believers who accept the Bible in its entirety as the inspired, infallible, inerrant, and completely sufficient Word of God. Therefore, we place a very high premium on the clear, systematic, and accurate verse-by-verse exposition of the Scriptures as well as the power of a life given to applying these Scriptures.
We are a community of believers that desires to share the Good News of Jesus Christ with others so that they too may find their complete satisfaction in Christ and experience His eternal and abundant life and then be added to our family as those who will be nurtured in their new faith in Christ.
We are a community of believers who believes God is sovereign, not only in and over the salvation of the lost but also in and over church growth. We believe God is the One who adds to the church those who are being saved (Acts 2:42). Therefore, we do not adhere to the Seeker-driven, church growth philosophy of ministry so prevalent in evangelical churches today. We believe the purpose of the weekly worship service is for the corporate worship of God and the edification of believers. While we are always glad to have unbelievers in our services, we will "not water down" or "dumb down" the content of our worship or our teaching to accommodate unbelievers. We also reject the "spirit of pragmatism" that has so permeated the contemporary church. We believe the standard of what honors and glorifies God is not best understood in terms of "what works" but rather, what is biblical.
We are a community of believers who are committed to aggressively pursuing missions in the East Mountains, New Mexico, and throughout the world so that God's Name will be made known and revered among the nations.
We, while very similar to many other protestant evangelical nondenominational churches, are also distinct from many in the sense that we are Calvinistic or Reformed in our understanding of the doctrine of salvation and in particular in our understanding of God's complete sovereignty in and over the salvation of man. By this, we mean that God, not man is the active agent in salvation. Furthermore, we mean that apart from God's gracious choice in eternity past and His Spirit's work of regeneration in giving a heart to desire God, no one would ever, of his own accord, come to Christ for salvation. We also profess our agreement with the great Reformation doctrines summarized by the well known sola's (Latin for "only" or "alone"): Sola Scriptura (Scripture Alone); Sola Fide (Faith Alone); Sola Gratia (Grace Alone); Solus Christus (Christ Alone); and Soli Deo Gloria (For God's Glory Alone).
We, while being an autonomous and denominationally unaffiliated local church are not opposed to believers in other churches nor are we opposed to fellowshipping and cooperating with other doctrinally like-minded churches, whether they are denominational or nondenominational. We also acknowledge the oneness of all true believers in Christ Jesus, whether in doctrinal agreement with us or not.

but, im not one to talk, since i couldnt hit the broad side of the barn today. I can usually beat the whole family at shooting clays, but for some reason today, my game was completely off. I mean, I couldn't hit a single thing!
Whew, just had to throw that out there. Im so excited to get it and start shooting with it. Okay, this sounds terrible, but I haven’t even got to really play with it yet. I had a senior session and shot with it, but I haven’t really got to play with HD video and my crazy ISO speeds.
With me getting my new camera, comes the overwhelming feeling and knowledge of how truly blessed and lucky I am to be able to even have this creative outlet. I love love LOVE taking pictures. And I truly love all my clients, and I am so honored to have them come into my life. I have had some really great times getting to know each and every one of them. It’s because of them that I can continue on doing what I really love and what makes me so joyful. Let me tell ya, there are no words to describe how I feel behind the lens. Peace. That’s all I can think of. I’m at peace with everything, and it is an amazing feeling. That’s not to say that there are the occasional butterflies when Im shooting a wedding and freaking out over how to get across the room full of people in about 4 seconds to get the shot I want. Weddings are a whole different ball game though, and they need a post all to themselves.
So, I didn’t want my clients to think that I’m holding their pictures for ransom and wanted to give you guys a heads up on what’s going on right now. Usually my turn around for getting your CDs to you is really quick, usually within 7 days of your shoot. But right now, wow. I’m so backed up on school and editing, it’s ridiculous! I’ll go do a shoot, then come home and do homework. I’ll upload the pictures from the session, then I get behind on my homework. I take some time to catch up on my homework, and I get behind on editing. Then I edit, then homework…you get the picture. It’s a vicious cycle really.
But school is almost over! YAY!!!!! And I’m seeing a light at the end of the tunnel! YAY!!! And I’m getting caught up on my homework! YAY!!! And I’m getting caught up on my editing! YAY!!! And I keep starting each sentence with a preposition! NOOOOOO!!! Haha

Our Public Library has a community program going on right now where they give you a free sketchbook to fill with art, sketches, writing, poetry, etc., Once returned, it will be placed in their Art Bound Books permanent collection. I knew right away that I would fill mine with stitching :)
I spritzed, sponged, painted or stenciled the pages and then stitched one kind of stitch per page. Most of the time I stitched through 2 pages to give support and to help prevent the paper from tearing.
I did not have a well thought out plan of what stitches or designs I would create but just let it happen.
I also drew on some of the pages. The outline of the owl is couched but the feathers, beak and tree were drawn.
Other stitches that I did besides these ones were: detached chain stitch, seed stitch, cretan, wheatear, chevron, buttonhole wheel, woven spider web and the pistil stitch.
There was a pocket at the back that I put some threads and small pieces of Aida cloth for anyone to take if they wanted to. I printed a Maya Angelou quote on the pocket after I took the picture: "You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have." It was a great project for me and I will return it to the library next week.
Beautiful book, Jenny! Wish I could see it IRL. It reminds me of The Sketchbook Project. www.sketchbookproject.com I have two booklets in their library. On one of them I took every two pages and stitches embroidery borders by machine. Then I glued stitched pieces of fabric to some of the pages. Looks like you did all the hand stitching through the paper. That must have been difficult!
Oh Jenny, how perfectly wonderful this is. What a good idea for your library to take on such a project. LOVE IT!
Great idea! This must be just what the library wanted participants to do. Every page holds a discovery and for anyone into embroidery it is a quizz, too, 'Name The Stitch'. I like how you have kept the thread ends stick out of the pages.
Fantastic - so much ingenuity, persistence and creativity. It's also a really imaginative thing for the library to do. Maybe they will move to cloth books in response to your contribution! It will certainly be well used.
What a wonderful program! You obviously have a very innovative library. Your creation is wonderful (especially that cool bird!).
what a great project to be involved with, I have not stitched on paper but i would think it would be quite hard to do
Brilliant Jeannette. And what a wonderful project by your library. I love how you have used your book, an inspiratonal project. xx
Thank you very much for stopping by and taking the time to leave me a comment. I appreciate all of them!

My husband also loved to cook. When we lived in Hoboken, he loved to whip up new and exciting meals like stuffed peppers or bolognese while I made things like spaghetti or turkey burgers. Our roles have since changed.
When I lost my job a few years back, I started to get into cooking. When I wasn’t job hunting or interviewing, I suddenly had a lot of time on my hands. While Eric worked, I needed an outlet. So I started to cook. I thought it would be nice for him to have something to come home to. Plus, I felt like I did something; it somehow justified me being home all day and not working.
When I reentered the job force, I still tried to cook. Unfortunatey, I just didn’t have the same kind of time to devote to my new hobby. After working all day in the city, commuting and then getting in a run or workout, cooking was the last thing I wanted to do. Besides, living in Hoboken, there were so many great restaurants and eateries to enjoy, it was so much easier to say, “Lets eat out tonight!”
Fast forward to mommyhood and my life in suburbs and I have found a new love for cooking. At first, I was somewhat intimated, like when I wanted to try to make a cookie cake for Eric for Father’s Day. He loved it when a girlfriend of mine made it so I faced my fear, gave it a try and found surprising success. Pintrest has become a good friend of mine as I look to create new and exciting dishes for our family like a chicken, artichoke and spinach pasta bake; balsamic chicken; homemade banana bread; or lasagna roll ups.
Believe it or not, cooking somewhat relaxes me. I feel creative. Staying home, I don’t always feel like that, especially after a successful career in public relations where I was constantly coming up with new ideas and initiatives seen all across the world. Cooking has filled a little bit of that void for the time being. While my daughter sleeps and I have some extra time in between cleaning, paying bills and catching up on “The Real Housewives,” I’ve found something new to be excited and proud of again.

When I lost my job, I knew I did not want to waste my time on the couch, watching TV and regretting that I didn’t do more with my time off. I had been unemployed before and regretted not taking advantaged of the time that I had when not looking for a job or taking care of things I otherwise didn’t have time to while I was working.
Immediately, I decided to volunteer. After working at a non-profit, especially one that depended so heavily on volunteers, I knew that there was a great need at so many organizations for people like myself. I could do more than just answer phones and stuff envelopes, I could help develop strategic plans, write press releases, build media lists, create collateral materials; the list was hefty with communications and public relations experience. And I would even stuff envelopes and answer phones. I just knew that I could and wanted to give back.
I began by applying at places that I interested me; places that I would like to work if I had chance, but since I couldn’t, at least could be a part of the team in a voluntary role. My interests varied, so there was a lot to choose from. Unfortunately, no one was answering my calls, emails or applications.
I must have applied to at least 10 non-profits in the last five months. I applied at the YMCA, the Jubliee Center, the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation, the Innocence Project, Hoboken University Medical Center, and others, throughout Hoboken, Manhattan and surrounding northern New Jersey towns, but no one got back to me. My husband even applied to a non-profit or two and no one got back to him either.
I understand that many non-profits are probably bogged down with unemployed people who are interested in giving back while they are looking for their next career move, but what I don’t get is how these organizations advertise and beg for volunteers yet don’t answer when people heed their call. I know that some volunteers only want to do something related to their field, but at least call them back. Maybe they’d be willing to do something else or contribute in another way that you never thought possible. Non-profits are losing many valuable people by not returning calls and emails of those who are willing to help. It creates a false sense of urgency for your causes and your needs. And by not developing these relationships, non-profits are losing more than just those who can help, but those who can help foster their mission.

Just today, I went to a scheduled unemployment orientation order by the State of NJ Department of Labor. I called to confirm my appointment a few weeks, as I had received two different dates in the mail. I was told by a staffer that I must attend both or I would lose my benefits. Seemed odd to me, since it was the same class, but hey, when the government says they’ll take away your money if you don’t do something, you do it. When I got to the office, it was closed and the class was cancelled. Apparently furloughs have taken effect and I wasn’t the only person who didn’t get notified. If I hadn’t shown up though, would they have cancelled my benefits?
To top off this pleasant experience, I was recently informed that my social security number, among other personal information (which I have worked hard to protect), has been potentially compromised due to errors at the Department of Labor. It may have been sent to employers that really weren’t my employers. Seriously? My state government can’t even keep records straight and private?

Before losing my job or trying to find a new career path, I always wished that I was doing something else. Doesn’t everyone? I always believed that the grass was greener on the other side. Isn’t it?
Since losing my job (oh, and we can’t forget the job I got but was taken back), I have been contemplating what my next step will be. Maybe this is the time to really delve into my writing (trying to do that). Maybe I should volunteer or give back somehow (applied to be a volunteer – I worked for Red Cross, I know how valuable volunteers are!). My mind is running aimlessly and endlessly.
Having been unemployed before, I understand the value of having this “free time.” The last time I lost my job, I was about eight weeks away from getting married. While I still interviewed and tried to find a job (I even landed a gig six days later but it wasn’t for me…is there a pattern here?), I also came to the realization that I had the opportunity to finish planning my wedding and start fresh on the employment path just a few weeks later. This time around, it’s a little different.
When my husband lost his job, I told him this was his opportunity to do a lot of the things he always wanted to do that he couldn’t because work got in the way, such as travel, play guitar, see family and friends. Of course, you’re still looking for work, but at some point, you burn out after hours at the computer, networking, phone calls. If you’re unemployed, you know the drill.
There is so much I want to do and be right now. It’s so confusing. I recently turned 31 and while I am still young (in my eyes at least), I feel like I have lost this huge opportunity to start something new, which I know is outrageous. I would completely discourage someone from that state of mind if they told me that.
So here are some of the things I have wanted to be since I lost my job and even while I was pitching stories and being the media maven that I have been for the last eight years:
While some of these occupations are completely attainable, some are so out of reach given where I am in life; at least that is how I feel. For example, if I wanted to be a doctor, I would have to be in school for like eight years and by then I would be almost 40 before I’d even be a resident or something. How would that affect my plans for the future, for a family, how would I pay back all those student loans? And let’s not get into the math and science aspect. I work with the other side of the brain, which brings me to the detective and scientist.
Sometimes I think I chose the wrong career. Communications is so broad; I wish I had a more definitive specialty. But I have excelled thus far and maybe my skill set can help someone down the road somehow, including myself. Maybe it’s just time to “nut up” and try something new and different. We’ll see. In the meantime, while I wait for Hollywood to call, maybe I’ll brush up on my math and science (and reruns of CSI and Law and Order can’t hurt either, right?).
Since my last posting, I too lost my job. I wrote my last piece back in early February and about four weeks later, I became a casualty of the workforce. I wasn’t all that surprised.
I worked for one of the nation’s most recognized non-profit disaster relief organizations. I handled their communications for the northern New Jersey region. Most recently, I had dealt with large scale fires in areas like Hoboken, Paterson, Newark and Jersey City, as well as the aviation disasters that hit my region, including US Airways Flight 1549 and Continental Airlines Flight 3407. It was a tough job when disasters hit, both mentally and physically. I could tell I was being phased out though. It didn’t take a rocket scientist to figure it out. Our CEO was instructing folks to find volunteers to do portions of my job and had consultants come in left and right to do other facets of communications. When I confronted him, he lied straight to my face. I understand if you can’t tell employees that they are going to lose their job in a few weeks, but note to upper management: don’t lie to your employees, you lose more credibility than you’ll ever imagine.
Back to my story. So I lost my job and my husband and I became a married couple with no positive cash flow coming in, despite some severance packages and accrued vacation time. Surprisingly enough, I never felt better. I felt so trapped at my job that when I lost it, it felt as if a 20 pound weight had been lifted from me. All the anxiety about whether or not I might lose my job, the low employee morale and the way that things were handled at the organization were no longer weighing on my shoulders. It was such a release. While I had a huge burden to deal with, which included finding health insurance, signing up for unemployment and assuring my husband we’d be okay, I felt better than I had in months.
In the interim, I had been applying for jobs for some time. As I mentioned, I wasn’t blown away by the fact that I let go, so I tried to keep one step ahead and beat job loss to the punch. A little over a week after losing my job, I was offered a position at a small public relations agency managing their staff and accounts. I was so excited. It seemed like a great growth opportunity and a perfect fit between my last job at an agency and my most recent job with a non-profit. It also took away the fear of having both my husband and I unemployed at the same time. It almost seemed too good to be true…
And so it was. About five days after accepting the position, the agency rescinded the offer. What? Are you kidding me? I know, I thought the same thing. The long and the short of it is that the company lost a major account and now could not afford to bring me on. It was like a TV show. I went from losing my job to getting a job to losing it all within about 10 days! All I could do was laugh.
I’m a worrier. I worry about everything. I worry about my parents driving home after dinner from a night out with me in Hoboken; I worry about my brother traveling through Australia; I worry about my socks not matching! Through this whole situation, I have probably had the most positive attitude of my whole life. I don’t know why I am not worried. I don’t know why I am not angry about what happened at my last job or about what happened to me with the job I had for about 96 hours, but I’m not.
At the end of the day, I have my husband and he has me. While I may have to give up some of my vices over the next few months if things don’t come together on employment front, I can do that. The world won’t end. I know I am better off than I was at the non-profit or if I joined the agency that thought I would be starting work with soon. Maybe public relations and communications isn’t for me. Maybe this is a new chapter that is opening up for me and I just have to figure it out. Maybe this is my chance to really make a difference. The possibilities are endless. While so many doors have closed, no they’ve actually slammed in my face over the three weeks, new ones will open and I’ll be there with a smile.
I am one of millions of Americans dealing with the unemployment crisis, only I have not lost my job. Recently, my husband lost his job and our world has dramatically changed. Not so much because we are changing the way we operate our finances or dealing with new health insurance carriers, and all that goes along with a job loss, but our roles in our marriage have taken a drastic leap.
I am a media junkie. I work in public relations so maybe that is why I am constantly glued to all things news. Whether I am watching local or cable news, reading the paper or surfing the net, I am always plugged in. But in all the coverage on this unemployment crisis, I have seen nothing about the changing roles in marriages that take affect when a man loses his job.
My husband was the promotions director for the number one classic rock station in New York City . He worked there for 10 years; a third of his life. Working his way up the ladder, he met celebrities, went to hundreds of concerts and received lots of perks, but worked harder than anyone I knew. He had survived layoffs at this company before, but this time, it was a massacre. Nearly 90 people from his New York office were let go and over 1,800 nationwide.
Having lost jobs myself, I knew what my husband was about to experience. There would be many ups and downs, a roller coaster of emotions were awaiting him. He would soon feel angry, depressed, lost, alone, invaluable, scared; the list goes on. Anyone who has lost a job, no matter what the reason, knows what I am talking about.
When my husband called me to tell me he had lost his job, I ended up taking a personal day and left my own job to be with him. While he didn’t ask me to, I knew that he would not know what to do with himself after things slowly started to settle in.
I helped him sign up for unemployment and contact his now former employer about his contract and bonuses he had yet to receive. I made him lunch and stroked his hair and told him everything would be alright. I also told him that he’d have to be patient as he started looking for a new job. Forget the fact that it’s hard enough to find a new job, but in this economy, with this many people out of work, especially in the New York City market, there were a lot of odds stacked against him. My husband has a lot of patience with me and for friends and family, but when it comes to personal goals and ambition, he becomes restless quite quickly.
Aside from all the sadness and anger about losing his job, we also came to the realization that we would be losing a home that we were in the middle of purchasing. We had been approved for a mortgage, our bid had been accepted and we were in the process of setting up the inspection when this all happened. We knew we had to throw in the towel on our dream home when there was only one income supporting us, despite a severance package. I was fine with this, as I was not 100% ready to move, but it broke my husband’s heart in a million different pieces that this was happening at the same time that he lost his job.
I hate to admit it, but I am a bit of a needy person. I don’t handle being sick very well or making decisions on my own. While I like to think I am an independent woman, I do depend on my husband for so much. Suddenly, I had to step up and be this entire support system, something that my husband had never needed in this fashion. Don’t get me wrong, I have been there for him whenever he has needed me, but usually, I need him more than he needs me. Not only did I have to help him, I had to deal with my own emotions and fears about my husband, the breadwinner, the rock of our unit, losing his job and how that would affect us.
It’s been a roller coaster for us both, but I can’t share my peaks and valleys with him right now; not that he wouldn’t be open to hearing what is on my mind, but I don’t want to add that stress to his plate. He is up at 7:00 a.m. every morning looking for jobs, even on weekends! One Sunday morning, I told him, “It’s Sunday, a day of rest, give yourself a break!” It breaks my heart knowing what he is going through as a person and as a man; a man who feels he should be supporting his wife through a paycheck and not unemployment. Don’t even get me started on that one!
It has been more than an emotional ride that I have taken through this whole transition, and that is what I think people forget when they talk about this economic crisis. We hear about the families and how they may not be able to put food on their tables or the educations that may suffer. There is constant chatter about struggling two income families not being able to make ends meet to pay the rent or car insurance, but no one talks about the generation who doesn’t have children to feed or put through school, but still has the same challenges and struggles. I am one of those people.
Since my husband lost his job, I feel I have lost a part of him. A piece of his spirit is gone. And while that may not make a great news story on CNN next to the family who can’t buy milk and eggs for their family of six, it makes headlines in my house. I also have lost things through this life change. I used to relish in my time alone. My husband may have worked late or had an event or went out with friends or colleagues after a long day and I had some “Michelle Time” as I like to call it. There is less “Michelle Time” these days. I would never tell my husband that, because he spends his days looking for work and then looking forward to me coming home. He spends most of his days in front of a computer or on the phone; networking, emailing, job searching. Sometimes I want to come home and just do some personal things on my own and I feel a sense of obligation to be with him since he has been alone all day. We are no longer playing on an equal playing field and sadly, it’s not by choice.
I know my husband will find a job, and while it might take longer than he would like, it will likely be better than his previous gig. I know we will find a house when the time is right and it will be even greater than the one we originally found. This job loss won’t define us, but it will help us learn more about each other and grow stronger. It would just be nice if mainstream America and the media remembered that there are others who have been affected by this terrible economic downturn in our country.

For instance, in the event that you have a deductible of $100, you’ll be paying that sum and any further costs will be dealt with by the insurance agency.
On the off chance that you are hoping to make a more thorough human services arrange, you’ll have to discover an insurance agency that offers what you requirement at a decent cost. This implies recognizing what you really require included. There’s no motivation to pay more than would normally be appropriate on the off chance that you don’t require certain things to be secured, so search for an arrangement that suits you.

Due to spammers annoying me, if you wish to become a member of this board you most first PM me (Gothicfires) through http://elliquiy.com
Note: Role playing rules may be updated at any time by the edit of this post. Role playing rules being changed after you become a member of In The Dark/Joint Ventures does not excuse you for not knowing them.
After you register on the board you MUST go to your email account and activate your registration. We apologize for the inconvenience but spammers have required us to make this a rule. If you do not get your activation email, please do not register again. Send an email to gothicfires'at'gmail.com and I will activate the registration for you. The email you send must be from the same address you registered with.
Registering does not allow you to see more than you already could if you were a guest. To have full access to the site you MUST create an introduction thread, affirm you are over the age of 18, affirm that you have read the rules and provide a writing sample. The list of questions you need to answer is located here.
If you have been referred to this site by someone here or are a member of Elliquiy or Odessy please let us know. We have joint members on those sites and it could speed your access.
For you idiots who are trying to advertise, don't waste our time ( I don't really care about your time.) ANY USERNAME WITH A [DOT]WEB EXTENSION (example imtooclever.com) will be deleted. Given that moderators are usually on most of the time it won't last long. (yes I am really irritated that I had to write this rule.)
Role playing members must be adults, 18 years of age or older. If you are not 18 and wish to role play then go to RPOL.
If you are found to lack the maturity to be a good member of this site, you will be removed. We will never issue more than two warnings. It simply isn't worth our time.
If you are easily offended, then there is 100% chance you will find something offensive here. Do not join. Both In The Dark and Joint Venture have specific places for things that might offend sensitive people. If you are sensitive then stay out of those areas. If something upsets you simply do not open the thread again.
No discrimination is allowed on any account. We are open to all races, religions, cultures and sexual orientations.
You are expected to be respectful of those whose views differ from yours. You may openly disagree with someone, but you may not flat out tell them they are wrong, stupid, pointless... etc. In the real world you meet people you don't like, you stay away from them. Here, you will likely find people that you don't like, do the same. We do not need snide comments, flame wars, screaming matches, drama in general.Adults should be able to have a discussion without tension and stress.
Realize that even though this is not 'real life' people have the same boundaries that they do in 'real life'
Do not "DO" or "Write that you are doing" anything to anyone with out getting permission of that person first. Example. Stranger types: *hugs GothicFires* This is wrong. Stranger should typed: *offers hugs to GothicFires* or "GothicFires may I hug you?"
You will see people here *hugging* or doing other things together all the time. Just because a member does this with another member does not mean you have a right to do it with out asking. If you accidentally "do" something to someone with out asking and they tell you not to do it again... don't. If you do it again you will get one warning... twice you will be removed from the board. There is no reason not to respect a persons boundaries.
If someone crosses your boundaries without your permission and you do not like it do not become upset. Yes i know this next statement will go against what is written above, but they aren't physically capable of touching you. Nor should you suffer in silence or accept it to 'keep the peace'. Tell the person that you did not like it and to please not do it again. If they do it again then report it to an administrator or a moderator and we will warn them. If they do it a third time then we will remove them from the board.
There are online and real life couples on this site. Some of them choose to live an alternative life style. You are expected to respect that life style. Example Shadow claims GothicFires as her slave and GothicFires agrees. That does not give you the right to call GothicFires or anyone else a slave with out their permission and if you wish to work with GothicFires in a D/s setting then you must ask Shadow who is her master. (Disclaimer. this is an example written without Shadow's permission because she and I are very good friends.. She would love to have me as a slave... as I am naturally an Alpha... its not going to happen.)
Limits, Before you start writing with someone, check thier limits, likes and dislikes, keep to them. While in the RPs no may not mean it or might be ignored, the members limits are to be respected.
Real life, We all have one, some are married or have a very fine relationship outside of the forums, because you have a nice steamy affair with them here does not mean that you are to expect or even ask them to have on in meat space (For those that need the definiton for that, it's slang for real life, the part of the day you are not on the net).
Real life again, Sometimes RL intrudes, work, family, school, whatever. Sometimes it's as simple as a case of writers block. If a partner has not posted to you in a bit, it happens. Send a quick PM asking if they are ok, something with the story that you can help them with, a gentle reminder that it is their post. Do not do this every 15 minutes telling them to post, demanding reasons, being generally rude. You don't know the real reason, your partner may just have had bad news and needs a little bit of time.
No sexual content is allowed in the board Everything Under the Sun as it is viewable by the public. Note your Avatar and pictures in the Signature are also viewable to the public.
No children, characters made in the image of children or characters with the mentality of a child may be in or role played in a sex scene. This includes just observing. Break this rule and your account will be closed and your ip given to law enforcement. The minimum character age here is 17. To be clear, a 70 year old elf that looks 12, no, a mature looking 14 year old, no, the age and apparent age of the character needs to be states as 17 or over.
No Necrophilia (animated dead, vampires, ghouls and other undead are exempt from this rule as long as they are not falling apart.)
Just because this is an Adult website does not mean your role playing games/stories need to contain sex.
Role playing non consensual (rape) is not forbidden on this site. However it can only be written in the Oubliette on the In The Dark board or the non consensual area of the Joint Ventures board. I want to make it clear that we at In The Dark, Joint Ventures and Gothic Fires in no way condone the hurting on another individual whether it be mental or physical. If you begin role playing a game outside designated areas and a non-con issue arises you must have a moderator move the game before you can continue. If it is a multi-thread group game the entire game must be moved or that segment of the game gets its on thread in an appropriate area.
If you have a problem with another role playing member, please try to work it out between yourselves in private. If you cannot then contact a Site Moderator and let them mediate.
Do not ever argue with a Moderator. If you do not like or agree with what they have said then you may state your case in a calm and polite fashion to the next level up (ie Game Moderator answers to Site Moderator answers to Administrators answers to Owners: Steve or Myself). In most cases the Moderators will win simply because they either have rules they want to follow with the game they are running or they are Moderators because we trust their judgment and given them that responsibility. However each issue will be looked at objectively. Owner decisions are final.
Role Playing games that have no activity for 3 months may be deleted. Though exceptions will be made for good stories.
Avatars cannot contain nudity. I cannot stress enough that children and teenagers will be able to find this role playing site.
Pictures in the private area may contain nudity. But not sexual violence, bestiality or be gory. If you need me to host a picture because it is not in the guidelines of free host picture sites, email me the picture to pictures@gothicfires.net. I will PM you the link.
New Members should only post in the Rules, Information & Entry Board. Posting in any other board before you are moved to the JV and/or ITD group will result in you being removed from the site. This is to prevent spamming on the boards that we use to help & promote those who are part of our community/family. If you are here with sincerity you will be accepted soon enough.
You must post an introduction before you will be granted access to the JV and/or ITD group so that you can see the entire board.
Please Note that the writing standards do not apply to the JointVentures board. However if you write on both boards you are still required to maintain these standards on the In The Dark board.
We who run In The Dark would never require role playing standards for anyone that we ourselves do not meet. All of us have extremely busy schedules. We take the time to role play, write and run this board because we enjoy it. So we ask that you provide the same quality role play writing that we do.
Try to make posts at least 100 words. We recognize that it is not always possible, but those times should be rare. Posts under three lines are not acceptable at all. If you answer the following questions then your post will never be too short:
what is going on around your character that does not directly affect your character yet gives more atmosphere to the game?
Do not control another's character with out their permission. The whole idea of role play is that there are multiple people involved. Sometimes the situation will warrant it, but always work with your role playing partners for the sake of the pleasure of all involved in the writing. Posts can always be edited.
If you haven't found this list to be unreasonable and are still interested please create an account and answer the questions from the thread Your Sordid Details. Please note that though other role playing members may greet you, acceptance for full membership must be made by a Site Administrator.
Unlike most other sites, I don't feel that people can't enjoy multiple sites. I have a list of other role playing sites under the Role Playing Resources. If you have a site that is not there and you would like me to list it them PM me the url. You are also permitted to put a link in your signature. If the site has a banner than PM it to me and I will be happy to use it in the appropriate place.
This is happened twice. I am posting this so it is something that I do not have to repeat myself on in the future.
It has been brought to my attention that when someone tries to link an avatar from E that the Avatar will show as a picture with Elliquiy's url in it. If you link to an avatar on another role playing site or another site period double check to see that it comes out the way you intended.

External memory (EM) algorithms are designed for computational problems in which the size of the internal memory of the computer is only a small fraction of the problem size. Blockwise access to data is a central theme in the design of efficient EM algorithms. A similar requirement arises in the transmission of data between processors in high performance parallel computation systems, for which blockwise communication is a crucial issue. We consider multisearch problems, where a large number of queries are to be simultaneously processed and satisfied by navigating through large data structures on parallel computers. Our examples originate as algorithms for parallel machines, and we adapt them to the EM situation where the queries and data structure are considered to be much larger than the size of the available internal memory. This paper presents techniques to achieve blocking for I/O as well as for communication in multisearch on the BSP and EM-BSP models. We describe improvements to the 1-optimal BSP* multisearch algorithm of [8] which permit larger search trees to be handled. In the area of EM algorithms new algorithms for multisearch in balanced trees are described. For search trees of size O(n log n) where n is the number of queries, we obtain a work-optimal, parallel, randomized EM multisearch algorithm whose I/O and communication time are smaller, asymptotically, than the computation time. We obtain a deterministic version via a similar technique. These algorithms are obtained via the simulation techniques of [12], [17], [13], [14], and [24]. For larger trees we describe a parallel, EM algorithm which is 1-optimal considering computation, communication, and I/O (for suitable parameter constellations) plus I/O-optimal. We give a lower bound to the number of I/O operations required for filtering n queries through a binary or multiway search tree of size m when m ≥ n2+ε, for a constant ε ≥ 0.
Edward Snowden a former United States citizen has appealed to Norwegian courts to be allowed into the country to accept a peace award without being extradited back to the United States. Norway has held that they cannot guarantee National Security Agency whistleblower protection from extradition to the United States if he travels to the country to collect an award.
Edward Snowden’s top extradition lawyers are afraid he will be extradited to the United States if he travels to Norway to collect a prize from PEN Norway. In April 2016 Snowden’s top extradition lawyers stated that they would be taking the Norwegian government to court to ensure Snowden would be able to travel to Norway in November to collect his prize from PEN.
Snowden could face up to thirty years in prison if he returns to the United States and faces the charges against him of espionage and theft of state secrets. Prior to 2013 when Snowden left the states to seek refuge in Russia, he revealed to journalists, information about the United States secret surveillance programs. At the time Snowden was a National Security Agency contractor, while supporters see Snowden as a whistle blower, a man who shone a light on the indiscretions within the United States agencies, the United States government believes he is a man who has committed a crime for leaking intelligence.
Since 2013 Snowden has been living in Russia where he was granted asylum. Russia does not have an extradition treaty with the United States unlike Norway who entered into an agreement in June 1977 and the agreement being given effect in March of 1980.
Snowden was invited to Norway by PEN international, a non-political organisation founded in 1921, PEN international now consists of over on hundred countries and holds special status as a consult at the UN and associate status as UNESCO. Snowden was invited by PEN to collect the Ossietzky prize for his efforts to enhance freedom of expression, with the presentation due to take place on November 18th 2016.
This is not the first time Snowden has been awarded a prize and unable to accept in person. In 2015 Snowden won an award of a similar nature but again was unable to attend as it was presented in Norway. For the third year straight Snowden has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, the winner is due to be announced on the 8th October but Snowden again for a third year will be unable to attend the ceremony in Norway. The Nobel peace prize is a prestigious prize that is a great honour to receive, unfortunately for Snowden even if he does win this year he ricks extradition to the United States if he attends the presentation ceremony.
Unfortunately for Snowden in June the Oslo district Court rejected the case brought forward by Snowden’s top extradition lawyers. Snowden’s top extradition lawyers then appealed to Norway’s Court of Appeal unfortunately in September 2016 the Court of Appeals ruling was to follow the decision of the lower court. The Court held that the case must be rejected, they held that the Justice Ministry cannot be placed under pressure to give advance decisions on extradition.
As William Nygaard, the chairman of PEN Norway, has stated the rulings handed down by the Oslo District Court and Court of Appeal were not unexpected decisions. Both Nygaard and Snowden’s top extradition lawyers are not yet defeated and are appealing to the Supreme Court.
According to the Oslo district court an early decision on extradition cannot be considered because Snowden has not stepped on Norwegian soil and Washington DC has not filed a request for Snowden to be extradited to the United States. The court of appeal concurred that a formal appeal from the United States must be received before a decision can be made.
This is not the first time Norway has made a similar decision on Snowden’s potential extradition to the United States. In 2013 when Snowden released to the media information about the National Security agencies surveillance programmes he applied for asylum in Norway. The response in 2013 was similar with the Oslo district court stating that for a person to seek asylum in Norway they must be physically present in the country, application could not be made overseas. Snowden although grateful for the asylum Russian governments have offered has stated that he would prefer to be in western Europe or back in the United States.
Unfortunately for Snowden the risk is that if he goes to Norway, Washington DC will make a formal appeal to have him extradited to the United States. This is a risk that understandably Snowden may not want to take and his top extradition lawyers would certainly not advise taking. Snowden did not enter Norway in 2013 to seek asylum nor did he enter the country to receive a different prize in 2013 this would suggest that if the Supreme Court do not rule in his favour he will not be accepting the Ossietzky prize in person in November as the risk of extradition to the United States is too high. If Snowden is extradited to the United States he faces charges under the Espionage Act, this means he would be tried before a judge as opposed to a jury and it is suggested these initial charges would see him face at least thirty years in prison and then he would most likely charged with numerous other charges.
Unsurprisingly Snowden is upset with the result from the court as it is once again another barrier to overcome. Snowden took to Twitter after receiving the news, expressing his disappointment he stated that the fight Norway’s government has taken is to win the battle, not the war. It seems sad that a person who is being recognised for outstanding efforts for freedom of expression is unable to have those efforts celebrated. Both PEN Norway and Snowden’s top extradition lawyers are insistent that they will not give up this fight and will be petitioning the Supreme Court to allow safe passage in November.
Please ignore my ring finger's scratch =) Normally it is really little but under macro it seems so huge!
In September we had our first review on the blog featuring a number of stunning pieces from Claudia Bradby's Coco and Heritage Collections. I'm delighted to have been given the opportunity to review Claudia's latest piece, the Poppy Friendship Bracelet, a beautiful piece of jewellery which carries with it a very special charitable donation.
Inspired by the ever-popular friendship bracelet and charity wrist bands, the Poppy Bracelet features white freshwater pearls on a bright poppy red ribbon. It is very reasonably priced at £38 and £5 from each sale will be donated to The Royal British Legion, a charity close to Claudia's heart, coming from a naval family herself.
The Royal British Legion is the United Kingdom's leading charity providing financial, social and emotional support for those who have served or who are currently serving in the British Armed Forces, and their families. Perhaps best known for the yearly Poppy Appeal, the legion is a campaigning organisation that promotes the welfare and interests of current and former members of forces.
This year's Poppy Appeal was launched yesterday November 1st and the legion is hoping to raise £1 million. Yesterday, Prince Charles greeted those working to raise money on board the London Poppy Day red bus where TV presenter Ben Shephard jokingly suggested kidnapping the Prince:
"We thought we could try and drive off with him on the bus and launch a ransom to raise more money. But he thought we wouldn't get very far".
A key date in the royal calendar is Remembrance Sunday. In the UK it is marked by ceremonies at local war memorials in most cities and attended by ex -servicemen and women, principally members of The Royal British Legion. The national ceremony is held in London at the Cenotaph on Whitehall and wreathes are laid by members of the Royal Family. This year's ceremony takes place on November 11.
The Poppy Bracelet is a very chic way of supporting the legion and helping the charity achieve their target this year. As with all of Claudia's pieces the Poppy comes beautifully presented in a jewellery pouch and placed in a gift box.
It is a classic pearl bracelet and simply lovely to wear and adds a timeless feel to any look (I wore it with a red dress today and the red ribbon detail worked wonderfully). I would highly recommend it and think it would make an ideal gift especially with Christmas coming shortly. I will be wearing it along with a poppy over the next couple of weeks to show my support for the Legion.
Claudia's very interesting blog is here (Claudia attended the launch of Pippa's 'Celebrate' and the latest post includes photos and tidbits from the event)
here? I'd really like to be a part of group where I can get opinions from other experienced people that share the same interest. If you have any recommendations, please let me know. Cheers!
I don't, no. I'm a huge fan of her work and thought a 'reviews' section would be an interesting addition.
It feels uncomfortable to say, but I don't like these reviews. I know you're not doing this to cash in, but when you post this reviews, it seems like you do! I don't mean to be nasty or anything, neither offend you. But I would be grateful if there where no more reviews in the upcoming future. Some of you may disagree but I tried, in the kindest way possible, to explain my own point of view. Thank you.
Thank you for the feedback Alice. I want to state very clearly I don't receive a penny for the reviews nor for this blog. I have advertising on the blog which pays for roughly half of the fee I pay photo agencies to licence photos.
The Poppy Bracelet was created for a very worthy cause and the Royal Family are huge supporters of the Legion. With Remembrance Day just over a week away people in the UK are very eager to support the Legion.
Claudia has worked very closely with Kate and is a friend of the Middletons, therefore I felt it completely appropriate to include her pieces. I have close relatives in the forces and it is a cause close to my heart and therefore, I do feel it was quite an offensive comment because this bracelet was created for a good cause and I take offence to the suggestion I might be 'cashing in'. If you were personally aware of the terrific work the Legion does (I have first hand experience of this) you would understand why I am eager to support them and when I saw Claudia was working to raise funds for the appeal I saw it as a perfect opportunity to support the cause and make readers aware of it, while keeping the blog on topic.
I will most certainly continue to do reviews if it helps a worthy cause. If people do not enjoy them, feel free to scroll down.
Kate has a handful of engagements each month and If I only posted on those days the blog would be very mundane indeed. I need to be somewhat creative and include other topics because the readers who are kind enough to check in each day deserve to see something new to read.
I've had this blog for roughly eighteen months now and have had plenty of negative feedback and criticism. All of which I accepted because everyone is entitled to their opinion but on this one occasion I felt I must respond because I found it very insulting and a gross misjudgement of my character.
I have been offered numerous advertising opportunities and very large donations to this blog and have turned them all down because I felt they were not right for the blog. I very carefully select items I choose to include. Just last week another Kate blogger (Carly from Kate Middleton Style) had a wonderful review on Claudia's pieces because she too, felt it a relevant topic worthy of inclusion. Like myself, Carly turns down most reviews.
To Alice from Seattle- I take offense to your post regarding Charlotte. You no nothing about this young lady who gives of her time and money to bring us Duchess fans up dates on what is going on with Duchess Catherine, what she is wearing, her likes & dislikes. Charlotte has all the right in the world to post anything she wants or endorse any item she wishes. We don't have to agree with her post but charlotte has given us fans a place to express our opinions.
But your opinion in this case was way off base in "my opinion". So again this is Charlottes page and she can do whatever she wants.
I am sorry if this sounds agressive and I have been told that I do write in an agressive way but this time I feel it is warrented.
Charlotte- I am sorry how Alice from Seattle has attacked you on your own page. I guess she know's no respect to the person who has worked hard and spent her own money to bring this great blog to people who are big fans of the Duchess.
I am sorry if in my post to Alice is too agressive but I felt it needed to be. If you feel it is too agressive don't post it. I know you want us to play nice but it is hard when you are attacked on your own blog.
Thanks you for this great post. I understand what Remembrance Day means to the people of the UK. We here in the US have what we call Veterans Day which is coming I think the 12th of November. It is our way of honoring our soldiers.
And it is your blog. If anyone wants to start their own blog, they could run it how they wanted to. You do a really great job of having interesting and relevant information. I enjoy all your posts. Thanks for all your hard work. I hope knowing that many readers thoroughly enjoy your writing encourages you a little! I say thank you to you.
I think it's quite amusing that Alice from Seattle is telling you what you should and should not include in YOUR blog, Charlotte ! Alice - why don't you start your own blog that will reflect your own preferences.
I don't care at all if Charlotte received any money for endorsing any item. She spends a great deal of time and personal resources on this blog which is for OUR (including you- Alice) entertainment. She should do what she sees fit.
ALICE in Seattle - Forgive me but what difference would it make if Charlotte received money for anything she posts on her blog??? It's HER blog to run as she sees fit and WE are here as "guests" for lack of a better word. If someone doesn't like the content they can refrain from clicking on the link to this blog or pass on a particular post. I don't see a problem, sorry.
I commend Charlotte for taking the time to keep the blog going because it's clear that her heart is in it. And at times like this I have even more respect for her!
CHARLOTTE: A few years back a lady from the UK had a blog and she began to charge approximately four dollars per month as a membership fee. The money enabled her to buy photos and videos to post. Well worth it! AND, by default it became a more positive, respectful environment.
What's up, always i used to check blog posts here early in the morning, because i like to find out more and more.
I'm really enjoying the design and layout of your site. It's a very easy on the eyes which makes it much more pleasant for me to
Good for you, Charlotte! We love you and your blog! Write whatever you wish -and I love the bracelet and the poppy tradition. I wish we in America had something similar. I love the flag but the poppy is much more elegant!
Good for you, Charlotte! We love you and your blog - write whatever you wish. I love the bracelet - I wish we in America had something similar. I love the flag but the poppy is much more elegant!
Thank you for your response about the jewelry post. I found the article interesting. I am about fashion and style and welcome non_Kate articles from time to time.
The poster had a view but glad you spoke about why you try to supplement the few appearances Kate makes. You put such dedication to this website please know the silent majority supports you your judgement your heart
I'd be interested to know why you would have a problem if Charlotte was making money from this site? As a blgoger myself do you have any idea how many hours of hard work she puts into this? taking requests from us and keeping up with the latest news. She is always the first with a post and as a reader from the US no one covers DOC like Charlotte.
I follow the blog all the time and have no problem with the reviews. In fact, I would have no problem if Charlotte took more money for advertisements, as long as we were aware of it. She puts enormous time into producing something hundreds of us follow, so why not. Why should she be paying from her own pocket for pictures we're all enjoying? When pictures were causing problems for the blog, many of us were willing to contribute to help and would still be happy to. If someone isn't interested in a review, just skip over it.
The only thing I wouldn't like if a review was followed by hundreds of fawning comments that sound fake! I've seen that happen on another blog but Charlotte has great sensitivity and the highest standards, and I know that would never happen here.
I think it's particularly worthwhile if the reviewed item has a charitable connection. Remembrance Day is very important in Britain.
Differences of opinions make the blog interesting but personal attacks have no place in it, whether it's against Charlotte or participants. We all have our own style and own opinions and that should be respected. I'm sorry to hear that Charlotte has faced other criticism she hasn't discussed. That's completely wrong, but sadly part of anything with public exposure. I hope she realizes almost all of her readers admire and support her.
Speaking of opinions, I'm far more concerned about Pippa using her connection with Kate to write a book she would almost certainly have not had have a chance to get published otherwise. Felt the same about Tom Parker-Bowles and thought the Duchess of Cornwall should not have become involved with that. Still, I wouldn't mind looking at Pippa's book. How's that for hypocrisy! Linda from California and Venice.
Dear Charlotte, it is YOUR blog and you can write whatever you wish :) if there are people who do not like a particular post, they do not have to read it :)
I really LOVE jewellery and if it had not been for your REVIEWS I would have never found Claudia's website and these stunning pieces.
I simply cannot believe the rudeness of people who think it's OK to tell you what is right or wrong to publish ON YOUR OWN blog.
Charlotte, I think you should do whatever makes you happy and comfortable in running the blog - whether it be accepting donations or advertisements, or anything. It's quite presumptuous of people to dictate to you what you should do, especially since they seem to be quite clueless of what it entails to run a blog of this visibility !
That said, I have to say - I really don't like Claudia Bradby's stuff. Never have - even on Kate when she was single. To me her pieces are, for the lack of a better word, kitschy. But each to her taste. And the cause is worthy.
Dear Charlotte, feel free to post ANYTHING you want to. It is your OWN blog and nobody has the right to dictate to you. You have my full support. KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT WORK! I really love your blog.
It is the height of ill manners for someone to attack you on your own blog for something they quite obviously do not understand.
Everything to do with poppies in November is done for charity and I am sure no British person would question that as it is so well understood.
That apart, I see nothing wrong with earning some money to buy the photos and to help with all the other expenses of running this blog.
Thank you for your hard work, I enjoy coming to it each day so see what's happening on the Cambridge front.
The poem goes on written by Canadian Military doctor Major John McCrae, during the 2nd Battle of Ypres.
The Royal British Legion used it as their symbol when Field marshall Earl Haig in 1919 say the Battle Fields of Flanders still covered in poppies.
Charlotte, you have my full support for everything you post on your blog. I’ve followed it almost since the beginning and really appreciate your informative and respectful posts and also your intelligent way to handle all the comments. It’s your blog and you should be able to post about any topic you think is relevant. You put so much time and energy in all this and you shouldn’t have to deal with such rude comments. If someone isn’t interested in a particular post, all they have to do is just skip it and not read it.
I try to comment on as many posts as possible, but don’t always have the time as I’m busy writing my diploma thesis right now. I do read every post though and enjoy very much coming to your blog and get all the news, it always gives me a welcome break.
At no point I thought that you were gaining money from anything you posted, I still remember the difficult days back in spring when the blog almost had to be closed down and you refused to accept donations from your readers in order to license photos. This is only one proof of your character.
About this special review feature: Personally I thought it was a great addition to the blog, as are the “Kate Loves” and “Fashionable Kate” posts. They are full with interesting information and fill up the time between official engagements. I didn’t know much about Claudia Bradby’s jewelry before so I was happy to know more about it. This bracelet is lovely and it’s especially nice that it also serves a good cause. Posting about it is totally appropriate I think as Remembrance Day is coming up and as I just read, Charlotte you have yourself relatives in the Armed Forces, which makes it even more understandable that you want to show your support.
I also enjoyed very much learning about Remembrance Day as this day doesn’t exist in the same way here in Austria. (We celebrated All Saints’ and All Souls’ Day on Nov. 1st/2nd where we honor and pay tribute to family members and friends that have passed away and also to soldiers and all those who lost their lives while serving the country.) So thank you for this post and keep up the great work :)
Claudia, I totally agree with everything you have said. Charlotte is a girl of character which was proved when her blog was attacked regarding the pictures. Charlotte refused to compromise and stood her ground even though her followers offered her donations for the pictures on her blog. I'm glad Charlotte answered Alice's question, I've rarely seen Charlotte make such a comment and if she has,, it has offended her too. She moderates the blog with utmost fairness and i appreciate and have learnt a lot from her in terms of drawing the line between constructive criticism and an attack. I also agree with everyone's comments and opinions above, this is Charlotte's blog and she has the right to publish whatever she wants to.She has a hectic schedule with school still she manages to do an awesome job with the blog and giving her readers the best.Thank you charlotte for all the hard work you put in for your followers,, you're the best!! xoxo
to mind. Is it just me or do some of the responses appear as if they are written by brain dead folks?
As a faithful reader, I say don't care about what this girl Alice wrote to you. I hope you know your blog is very much appreciated by a large number of fans. And I mean, your fans. Not only the Duchess'.
I don't quite understand everything about the English culture, but it is very obvious Remebrance Day is a very importante day for British people. And you should stick to your own beliefs. The bracelet is so delicate, so pretty and it becomes even prettier because it helps a cause that matters to a lot of people. I wish I could buy it, but I'm afraid they don't deliver to the placê where I live.
May I ask you something? It may sound silly, but here I go... Why do you wear poppies and not another type of flower attached to your clothes in Remembrance Day? I've heard each poppy relates to one beloved person you lost at War. Is it true?
'The remembrance poppy has been used since 1920 to commemorate soldiers who have died in war. Inspired by the World War I poem "In Flanders Fields", they were first used by the American Legion to commemorate American soldiers who died in that war (1914–1918). They were then adopted by military veterans' groups in the Commonwealth; especially Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Today, they are mainly used in current and former Commonwealth states to commemorate their servicemen and women who have been killed since 1914. In those states, small artificial poppies are often worn on clothing on Remembrance Day/Armistice Day (11 November) and in the weeks before it. Poppy wreaths are also often laid at war memorials.
The remembrance poppy is especially prominent in the UK in the weeks leading up to Remembrance Sunday. They are sold by The Royal British Legion for its "Poppy Appeal" and it is seen as befitting for public figures to wear one, which some have berated as "poppy fascism". The poppy is especially controversial in Northern Ireland and most Irish nationalists refuse to wear one due to the actions of the British Army during The Troubles. There has also been controversy over their introduction to the world of sport'.
PS: Glad to see Alice apologised to you and your readers! I bet she is a good girl, most people would hide away and never come back! =)
I must say I don't like this bracelet so much, because of the many pearls. I think pearls seem a bit old-fashioned, if I may say so, although I do have one pair of pearl-earrings myself. But I like Claudia Bradby's other pieces of jewellery and will definitely get something sooner or later, especially as the price is acceptable. But the bracelet is for a good cause and that makes it more attractive upon a closer look. :-)
I enjoy your reviews, Charlotte, especially as there is an obvious connection to Duchess Kate; she has worn Claudia's pieces before and will do so in the future, I guess. I see no difference between showing and discussing clothes and jewellery that Kate has just worn and other items she COULD possibly wear. I am very interested in Kate's style in general, so I think it is a great idea that you, Charlotte, show us what comes across your mind and we can look at it, think about it and exchange our views.
Charlotte, you often invite us to suggest our own ideas for the next “Kate loves” - posting, and you asked us if we appreciated a Pippa-page or not, so possibly Alice misunderstood you by not adding ideas but asking you to leave something out that she does not like. I don’t think that Alice intended to criticise and hurt you, but if that is what you feel, you should tell us readers.
All in all we should not forget that a face-to-face communication is so much easier than just writing posts, because we do not see if the other one is smiling or perhaps even getting angry. But then the internet enables us all from different parts of the world to get into contact with each other. Without Duchess Kate and the wonderful Charlotte we would have never had the chance to talk to each other about one of our favourite topics.
I remember someone here on this blog musing about a meeting, which is a fantastic idea. If I ever win the lottery, I will pay for your flight tickets and invite you all to a Duchess Kate – meeting in London! But until then I will enjoy meeting you here!
Marion, thank you, because you were the only person who understood my point. I opened my mouth about the question because people were voting against or in favor of a Pippa Page. I didn't know the other sections of the blog weren't in the same situation.
Charlotte, I am truly and deeply sorry for the fact you felt offended by my comment. I never ever wanted to do that. I felt miserable all over the weekend because I didn't know what to do. Please, please forgive me. And please, don't feel like I was questioning your caracter. Because I surely wasn't. All I can say is that I lost a great chance to keep my mouth shut. I will repeat again and again, please, please, forgive me.
To all the readers here, I hope you can understand that didn't have any will to hurt Miss Charlotte. I was misundertood. Im' not like Robert, who said terrible things about Pauline in the last post. I wasn't been nasty or anything, at least I thought I wasn't.
Charlotte, If you feel like not posting any comments I make, feel free to do it. I will be haappy to continue to follow this blog in very silent way.
Thank you for your apology Alice. I appreciate it. I hope you understand why I had to respond, you are fully entitled to your opinion but I did feel compelled to respond. I'm sure we have all written things we regret, please don't feel you must feel silent. Everyone is welcome to discuss Kate here and comment on the posts.
Just one quick note, Robert and Pauline have agreed to move on and to respect each other's opinions. I would prefer, out of respect to both of them that commenters didn't bring up previous comments. I would hate for anyone to feel isolated.
o Alice from Seattle- Thank you for taking the time to say your sorry to Charlotte. We all here do take offense to people attacking Charlotte but you took the time to come forward and apologized to Charlotte. Please don't be afraid to post here again. I feel we are all just like family. And if I came off aggressive to you, it was just your comment at the time really upset me. As you know Charlotte works so hard on this blog to keep us all up to date on everything going on with the Duchess & William. And she spends her hard earned money on the pictures she posts.
Alice, I apologize for any misunderstanding and I respect you for clearing things up. Marion is absolutely correct. Written communication can be tricky when you don't fully know the poster's personality or his/her intent. :)
and I'm looking at alternatives for another platform. I would be fantastic if you could point me in the direction of a good platform.
I don't post in the comments section very often, but I had to add my voice to all the other people who are supporting you. You do a FANTASTIC job with your blog - it's interesting, touching, informative, well-written, and it really brightens my day! I hope that you don't get discouraged by negative comments because I would venture a guess that there are many, many more people who love your blog! And - speaking as the wife of a man who served 26 years in the U.S. Coast Guard - I really appreciated this blog about the poppies and Remembrance Sunday.
Charlotte Ive been thinking a lot about this post. If I could I would purchase one of those braceletts for each of my neices. Since I cant do that I thought instead of my yearly call to our 84 year old veteran friend this year I'll get off my arse and go see him. A lot of us can only imagine the horrors of war. Just read a true story (Clara's War) she was a young girl in Poland during WWII who had to hide under a house because she was Jewish and now I noticed you have a blogger from Poland! So cool ; love hearing from other countries. Freedom is never cheap. Thank you for helping us remember those in all of our countries who have given of themselves or lost their lives . PS I wish we did the Poppy thing here too.
HI Sarah- I remember something when I was younger where vetrans would sell the Poppy flower. And I think it was for Vetrans Day which is 12th of November. But I have not seen them in a few years. Maybe we don't do it here any more. Too bad if we don't. What a great way to remember al who have given to their countries.
Hello Pauline & Sarah- I too, vividly, remember veterans selling Poppy flowers & as I get older & understand more history, I have a greater respect for veterans. I am not sure just when this custom faded away.
Charlotte - I second the others who encourage you to continue your blog as you see fit - I love it all!!! I would gladly pay a subscription to recoup your costs.
The veterans still provide Poppies in Northeast Iowa every Sping in which they accept donations from anyone who would like one to wear. Each year they also select a young girl to be Miss Poppy. Miss Poppy is the first one to offer a Poppy to someone, such as the Mayor. Miss Poppy is also in the Memorial Day parade.
To all of the Duchess fans that have come to the protection of Charlotte from that unwelcome attack on her. I would like to say it does my heart good to see so many of use coming together in support of Charlotte who put's so much engery into this great blog and the money she spends out of her own pocket for the pictures. And we have to remember she is a college student and all of us who have attend/attended college know that it is not cheap.
I know many of you do not care for many of my post and call them aggressive. I want to say I am sorry if I have offend anyone. We are here to support Charlotte and to enjoy her great posts about the Duchess. We all have our own opinions and that is what is great about this blog. We don't have to agree with each other but we do have to respect each other. And most of all we need to respect the great writer Charlotte.

Greetings from Colorado! I'm bored to death at work so I decided to check out your site on my iphone during lunch break. I love the info you present here and can't wait to take a look when I
My last blog (wordpress) was hacked and I ended up losing many months of hard work due to no data backup.
Again, a huge thank you for all the supportive comments. As moderator of the comments I always try to stay impartial and take criticism about the blog but I felt I had to reply to that comment. Most definitely the most personally insulting one I have ever received.
From Elisabeth in California. I greatly appreciate the time and effort that goes into this blog. And I love to learn about Claudia Bradbury pieces and hope you will continue to add little snippets of her work throughout the blog. CB's style of jewelry is a lovely match to the Dutchess' fashion.
I feel sad that you had to read all those comments when your tone and intention were misinterpreted. I wish you would have spoken up sooner rather than endure everyone's comments and attack. I think that it is difficult via text to convey emotions. I read your original post again and you did try your best to convey your opinion in a non-offensive way. I hope that you will find courage to post again.
Hey Alice, sorry for any misunderstanding. I think we all just wanted to support Charlotte because she works so hard to provide a top notch blog! Charlotte, thanks again. I hope you feel better.
switzerland travel guide The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy sponsored award is one of the most competitive categories in the Trade Association Forum’s annual awards. It recognises a successful initiative, by a trade association, to tackle an important issue that will drive the future prosperity and growth of its members. Friends and colleagues gathered to applaud worthy winners across seven categories – and recognise the creativity and dedication which underpin the whole sector’s contribution to the economy, to society and to customers, staff and stakeholders. “None of the homeowners featured on the show know they’ve been chosen to receive a home makeover – it’s a surprise, so I can’t say any more about the episode we’re involved in at the moment. You’ll have to tune in and see it for yourself!” “We are a trade specialist so all retail enquiries and enquiries from smaller independent installers are handled by our customers, which means they are sharing directly in the success of our campaign.” Ms Stephens continues: “The new extension has provided a fantastic and really flexible space that thanks to the new PURe® patio doors and windows, can be enjoyed whatever the weather. It’s great to be able to open up the living space and enjoy the close access we now have to the garden but even when the blustery weather that we are so familiar with here in the Yorkshire Dales takes hold, the glazing has provided us with a peaceful and cosy retreat. It’s the perfect space for both work and relaxation and I couldn’t be happier!” We’ve been determined to create a more productive conversation and shared vision for improving competitiveness through decarbonisation and energy efficiency – and to get people on all sides to understand one another and be ready to play their part. I want to express my thanks to the British Glass staff who have made this happen.”

We wanted to have a gender reveal with family and friends online like we did with Antonella for baby #2, so after hearing ideas from people and looking at creative ways to do it we decided to go with a giant black balloon filled with confetti and streamers.
I was 18 weeks pregnant when we did it, and since the day I found out I was pregnant I had hoped for a baby girl, nothing against boys, love them! I just wanted my girls to have what my sister and I have, the best friendship in the world. So people would ask me and I would reply with the politically correct answer, it doesn't really matter, but I wanted a girl.
When I first got pregnant and lost the first baby God spoke to me about having two girls and a third baby (dun dun dun!! we'll see how that goes). So based on that I really thought this baby was a little girl.
When we went to the ultrasound, on Friday morning, the lady was having fun asking us to close our eyes and having fun with us. She kept referring to the baby as a 'he' though so I thought maybe this wasn't my girl. I decided to be excited about having a little boy because I never wanted my babies to feel like I was disappointed. So I started dreaming about fun baby boy clothes and the relationship he would have with Antonella. Like Caleb's and Angie's! They are awesome.
For a couple days we waited and then finally Sunday afternoon came. The video apparently didn't work that well so half of our friends and family couldn't watch it, but thankfully we had pictures. Both Caleb and I were truly surprised when we saw pink flying all over. We were having another girl!!! Antonella was having a little sister!!!
We feel so blessed God has given us two little princess warriors. We are looking forward to meeting this little one and seeing her personality come through. I can't believe I get to raise best friends like my sister and I are.
And even though I told myself I’m not going to worry about how many readers I have for the first year of blogging I can’t help it.
I can’t help but think, Man, I post something on here every single day and I feel like I should have more traffic by now.

Hi, I’m Sharon – a furniture painter & restorer from Australia, who loves to up-cycle and repurpose old neglected pieces and bring them back to life again. My blog was created for thrifty DIYers and home renovators to encourage them to make transformations in their own homes, with educational tutorials, tips and inspirational makeovers. As a mother of four teens, and wife to a busy self-employed audio/video guy, life can be crazy at times, so painting furniture is a bit like therapy for me! My blog began out of a love for taking things (mostly furniture) that have been left for ruins, bound for the dump, kicked to the curb – and giving them a new lease of life. There’s such great satisfaction in being able to bring something out of the storage shed, create a new look, and give it a place of honour in the home again. You’ll be surprised what could be hiding in your house gathering dust, that could be given a completely new lease of life! Join me as we learn together. There are such a variety of ways of making old things become new again!
They offer value for money as I have compared with other service providers and found their billing reasonable.
Kathleen Johnston is pleased to make available insights into her life’s passion and the results of her work, via her blog that covers issues relevant to Women @ Work, and through her books, released in August, 2010, Ordinary Women—Extraordinary Lives: A Woman’s Career Legacy and Ordinary Women—Extraordinary Lives: A Woman’s Career Diary.
While interviewing and conducting research for my master’s thesis, I was inspired to create Ordinary Women—Extraordinary Lives: A Woman’s Career Legacy: part inspirational stories and part career journal.
Each of the eight women interviewed had created an extraordinary life. The book is a compilation of their personal career journeys and has been created to celebrate the ways in which women contribute significantly to society and the common good and how women, through both their paid and unpaid work, make the world a better place.
Each woman's unique story reflects a lesson to be learned and serves as a catalyst for the reader's reflection on her career. It is my sincere hope that the stories of these eight women will serve to motivate and inspire readers to join in the process of celebrating their career journeys by taking the time to reflect upon and record their very own legacy within this Keepsake Journal.
While creating A Woman's Career Legacy, intended for women closer to the end of their careers as a means for celebrating their achievements and sharing their legacy, the idea came for a book for younger women. Ordinary Women—Extraordinary Lives: A Woman’s Career Diary: has been designed to provide women with the opportunity to diarize their current career experiences.The book contains 18 topics of relevance to today's career women, with each topic section followed by ample journal pages for personal reflection. The book can also be used in group discussions with friends and colleagues as a means for sharing personal insights and experiences, enhancing mutual support and meaning.
Kathleen's journal/books“ Ordinary Women: Extraordinary Lives: A Woman’s Career Legacy and A Woman's Career Diary" are available for purchase from this website.
Informed by both academic research and lived experience, A Woman's Career Legacy highlights the remarkable achievements of 8 Alberta women at the height of their professional careers.
Each woman's story is a parable for career success as it unveils how she created her own version of truly extraordinary living. Employing a journal format, the book provides you with theopportunity to create a written account of your personal career legacy for your loved ones to enjoy.
The book journal A Woman's Career Diary, contains 18 topics relevant to today's women who are at an the beginning or middle stages of their career journeys. As a personal diary, there is ample journalling space for the reader to reflect, reveal, and record her career experiences.
It's also perfect for group discussions where individuals can share their insights and experiences with other like-minded women.
Purchased together or separately, each beautiful book makes an excellent personal gift for yourself or an important woman in your life.

Solution for Health: Improve the health of our children by establishing Health Coordinators in school districts. | Ben Kallos, Re-Elect to New York City Council in 2017
Solution for Health: Improve the health of our children by establishing Health Coordinators in school districts.
Thousands of children across the City suffer from chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, sickle cell anemia, and poor dental or vision care. The City should fund a Health Coordinator in low-income school districts to oversee a team of case managers to work in schools, linking uninsured children and children with chronic illnesses to doctors and other appropriate pediatric resources. Health Coordinators and their staff would also track sick days and new sicknesses, catching problems before they become bigger. By placing information online, and having a phone number to call, the Health Coordinator program would be a place where parents can learn about new threats to their children’s health, such as this year’s Swine Flu, and public health officials can better study trends in children's sicknesses.

A Washington federal court on Thursday granted a request by the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation for immediate relief to prevent law enforcement from halting their members from selling fireworks sanctioned by tribal permit or confiscating the merchandise. Earlier this week, several fireworks stand operators had been given a day to close their stands or risk arrest and seizure of their merchandise by Klickitat County officials.
WASHINGTON – Sen. Ron Wyden announced the Senate Thursday passed several measures he fought to include in the Senate Farm Bill, including the bipartisan Hemp Farming Act, as well as several provisions to help hop growers and provide drought relief to Oregon farmers. The bipartisan Hemp Farming Act defines hemp as an agricultural commodity and removes it from the list of controlled substances. The Hemp Farming Act gives states the chance to become the main regulators of hemp production, allows hemp researchers to apply for competitive federal grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and makes hemp farmers eligible to apply for crop insurance.
Annual Water Quality Reports for 2017 have been by the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs. They are available online on the Tribal Website – there are three, the Sidwalter Community Water System, Simnasho-Schoolie Water System and the Warm Springs Water Treatment Plant Community Water System. Information will be posted in the community, in the next Spilyay Tymoo and you can find links on the KWSO website under local news. A Water and Wastewater open house is set for July 9th at the Community Center from 5:30-8pm for community member to learn more about the reports and get information on current and future water and wastewater projects.

The Hong Kong & Shanghai Hotels, owners of the iconic Peninsula brand, has announced the group's newest property in Yangoon. Located in the heart of Myanmar's economic capital, the hotel will be housed in the former Burma Railway Building (pictured), with close proximity to key attractions in the city, including the Shwedagon Pagoda and Scott’s Market. The hotel will restore and preserve the colonial architecture of the railways building, with the hotel expected to open in 2016.
The Peninsula Hong Kong has also relaunched the Peninsula Academy, offering unique guest experiences imbued with cultural appeal and glamour. The stunning collection of guest programmes provides insider access to otherwise unattainable, culturally nuanced and luxurious experiences, both within the hotel and beyond
“Guests who know The Peninsula and Hong Kong extremely well will often ask me, ‘So what do you have in store for me now – that I may not have already experienced?’” says The Peninsula Hong Kong’s General Manager, Rainy Chan. “Within both the hotel and the broader context of this incredible, bustling city, the majority of The Peninsula’s discerning guests have enjoyed multiple facets of the visitor experience here. Through The Peninsula Academy, we continually embrace the challenge of keeping our guests inspired, surprised and delighted by the new – and where possible, the unknown – and always with a view to remaining unfailingly authentic.”
An example of the new experiences is the Journeys of Peninsula, a programme which enables guests to leave the city behind in the hotel’s twin-engine Aérospatiale Squirrel helicopter, with a flight over dramatic mountains and breath-taking land and seascapes en route to the stunning beaches of Tai Long Wan in Sai Kung. This is followed by speedboat transfer to a luxury motor-cruising yacht. Having arrived at a secluded bay, a magical dining experience a world away from the urban cityscape awaits. In this tranquil, sheltered cove, Peninsula staff are on hand to serve a luxurious beach banquet on the sand dunes during this escape to an island paradise in the outer reaches of Hong Kong. www.peninsula.com

PLEASE READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS. It is important that you complete all steps to insure that your loan application is properly processed. Failure to do so will delay the certification of your loan. This process must be completed by the parent borrower, not the student.
Providing your child with the best postsecondary education possible plays a crucial role in their career development. If you need assistance in financing their education at Bloomsburg University, you may apply for a Federal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS Loan). Please note the parent borrower is responsible for repayment of the PLUS Loan, not the student. Additional information regarding this loan may be found at http://intranet.bloomu.edu/aid/guide/loans/plus_undergrad.
The parent borrower must be the dependent student's biological or adoptive parent. A stepparent is also eligible to borrow a PLUS Loan only if their income and assets were used on the student's Free Application for Federal Student Aid in the academic year that loan is being requested. A legal guardian is not considered an eligible borrower.
Federal regulations require that in order to receive PLUS Loan the parent borrower cannot be in default or have an overpayment of federal aid. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid if you have questions about your eligibility.
If you have federal loan(s) previously discharged due to disability, check with your loan servicer as to how a new federal loan may affect the discharged loan(s) before you apply for a new loan.
WHEN YOU SHOULD APPLY: Please use the following as to when you should apply for the loan. The credit check is only valid for 180 days. Applying too early may require the parent borrower to recomplete the application process if credit expires before disbursement of the loan can be made.
Federal Direct PLUS Loan applications must be certified by the Office of Financial Aid by the last day of the semester. Therefore the parent borrower must complete all steps at least one day prior to the end of the semester.
The parent borrower must log into StudentLoans.gov using their own FSA ID Number, not the student's. If you have multiple students enrolled needing a PLUS Loan, a separate PLUS Loan Application must be submitted for each student. If you experience any technical issues or have questions on this site, please call Applicant Services at 800-557-7394.
Select an Award Year - Make certain you select the correct Award Year or the loan will not be processed.
Award Range - When prompted select the appropriate dates you wish to have this loan processed for. You may apply for one semester at a time or multiple semesters in an academic year.
Loan Amount Requested - When prompted indicate the amount you wish to have processed for the award range. Amount requested will be split between semester(s) indicated in the award range. Please indicate whole dollars, no cents. If you want the maximum, you may indicate maximum. An origination fee of 4.248% of the borrowed amount will be deducted by the federal processor when the loan is disbursed. Estimate this amount in your amount requested. For example, a $5,000 loan will have an approximate net disbursement of $4,787.
The credit decision will be provided at the end of the process. If the credit is approved, proceed to STEP 2 - Submit PLUS Master Promissory Note (MPN). If the credit is denied, the parent may appeal or apply with an endorser. For instruction on how to do this, please contact Applicant Services at 800-557-7394. If parent is not able to appeal or apply with an endorser, the student may submit a request in order for additional loan to be processed in the student's name.
The PLUS Master Promissory Note (MPN) is a legal document that holds the parent borrower, not the student, responsible for repayment of current and future loans. The PLUS MPN is valid for 10 years and does not require you to complete another MPN for subsequent borrowing unless the original MPN was approved with an endorser. If an endorser is required, future borrowing will require that a new MPN be submitted.
Parent remains logged into StudentLoans.gov using their own FSA ID Number, not the student's. If you have multiple students enrolled needing PLUS Loan, a separate PLUS MPN must be submitted for each student. If you experience any technical issues or have questions on this site, please call Applicant Services at 800-557-7394.
Bloomsburg University's Office of Financial Aid will certify your Direct PLUS Loan once all required information has been received (i.e. completed FAFSA, completed MPN, verification of at least half-time enrollment in an eligible program, and satisfactory progress earned). The PLUS Loan will appear on the student's MyHusky Self-Service Account when it has been processed.
The funds will be delivered through Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) directly to the student's school account. Get more information on tentative disbursement dates. In order for the loan to be disbursed, the parent borrower must complete all required steps above before the last day of enrollment for the term in which the loan is processed. The student must be enrolled at least half-time at the time of disbursement.
Information on how to reduce or cancel the loan can be found at http://intranet.bloomu.edu/aid/reduce_loan.

My ears pricked up the first time I heard the word yoga. There was something immediately intriguing about it. I happened upon Lilias Folan, "the Julia Child of Yoga", on PBS. She introduced me to the basics. Around 2000, yoga was mentioned more and more in conversation. I was attracted to the poise, elongated bodies and grace I saw in the people who practiced. I bought a Baron Baptiste DVD and learned to love yoga. Facing my fear of exercising in public, I went to Susan's Power Flow class and was wholly captivated.
I seek the strength and calm the practice brings. Sometimes, I want to see where the practice will take me. Often, I aim not to fall down.
I'm a fan of spine and chest openers like Ustrasana (Camel), Dhanurasana (Bow) and Bird of Paradise for the exhilarating, invigorating feeling.
I like Power Flow class. Some days I'm nervous, anticipating the challenge. For me, that is part of the beauty of yoga. It teaches me breath by breath, here and now, through each moment, anxiety falls aside.
At times, I've felt at odds within my own skin, restless, worried, set on warp speed. Much of the serenity I feel today is because of yoga. Yoga has introduced me to new, inspiring people. It has presented a non-aggressive force. Yoga has given me an awareness and desire to better my health, to relax and enjoy life. I have a deeper sense of gratitude and that is a wondrous place to be.

The stars, the birds, finding blackberries on a walk, meeting a tortoise making his way across my garden, the delight of meeting the interesting and genuinely kind souls that call this home, too.

City of Lies, Johnny Depp’s next film, was recently pulled from release in the U.S. after Depp was sued by a location manager for punching him in the face. The movie was originally scheduled to hit theaters next month but is now delayed indefinitely. However, Disney doesn’t seem to take issue with any of Depp’s actions, including beating up his ex-wife, and is currently developing yet another Pirates of the Caribbean sequel.
This week our panel takes on Disney’s apparent double standard. Why is it that they are so quick to fire people like James Gunn and Roseanne while they continue to employ others like Keith Olbermann and Johnny Depp? Listen as we discuss why we think this is, and what, if anything, we think will ultimately happen.
Now that you’ve heard what we think about Johnny Depp and how Disney seems to protect him, we want to hear what you think! Are we wrong about this, or does Disney truly have a double standard when it comes to their money makers? And is that a bad thing? Send us an email (feedback@hopestrikesback.com) letting us know. Or feel free to leave a comment below or message us on Twitter or Facebook. We’d love to hear your thoughts!

Following Brown and Sessions (1999) we apply the comparative techniques originated by Wolpin (1977) and Psacharopoulos (1979) to discriminate between the weak and strong screening hypotheses. Our data provides additional empirical results for the Italian labour market shifting the focus of the relationship between education and wages from the highest level of education completed to more specific measurements like degree score and completion speed. Our results show that the strong screening hypothesis is strengthened, i. e. that educational performance has an insignificant return for the self−employed, but a significantly positive return for employees.

After spending two weeks with a total of 3 dining options in Tanote Bay we, and our bellies, were very excited to get to Kuala Lumpur. KL is the federal capital of Malaysia and one of the more diverse cities we’ve visited in Southeast Asia. The three main ethnic groups are Malay, Chinese, and Indian which is only important to me becaue it means I can get deliciously diverse food. If you’re interested in the cultural, social, or political dynamics of these peoples living together go read another blog because I can only tell you about how these three cuisines intermingled in my belly.
A typical food court with hawker stalls around the perimeter. Some of the best food comes from these stalls.
You’re probably familiar with Indian and Chinese food, but Malay food isn’t as common. At least not in the U.S. Malay food is like a marriage of Indian and Chinese cuisines, but I’d say it’s an unequal marriage because you can really see the Indian influence in the strong spices used in most dishes. If you didn’t know Malay food, you could easily mistake it for Indian. Popular Malay dishes include nasi lemak, satay, and nasi goreng. Just to name a few. Another popular cuisine in Malaysia is Nyonya food which came from the literal marriage between the early Chinese migrants and the local Malays parts of Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. If you’re like me you’ll call it “Malaysian” food, but technically it’s a distinct cuisine with it’s own history and signature dishes. KL isn’t known for Nyonya food so if you want the best of this cuisine you will have to go to Penang or Melaka.
I love Indian food. I love it so much that if I couldn’t marry ice cream and cake I would marry Indian cuisine. Wait, who says I can’t marry ice cream and cake? I figured since same-sex marriage is legal food marrying should be too. Damn these religious zealots and their lies!
Vegetarian thali lunch at Sangeetha in Little India which is not to be confused with “big India” at Brickfields.
I’m less enthusiastic about Chinese food, but there are some great dishes in KL that you should try while you’re there. We were lucky enough to have a local introduce us to some of the best Chinese chow in KL.

I graduated from Cornell High School in 1983. Shortly after graduation, I headed off to school to complete my generals in the big town of Eau Claire. I wasn't sure really what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. A few years later, I decided to begin my education into the "Early Childhood Education" program. After completing my schooling, I enjoyed working as a teacher in a preschool setting. Deciding I wanted to do more, I went back to school once again and continued to move up the educational ladder until graduating from Mount Scenario College with a bachelor's degree in Elementary Education Pre-K - 6th grade.
I currently live in Cornell with my husband Rich, whom is a Materials Management Coordinator at WS Darley located in Chippewa Falls. We are blessed with three boys, Ben, Travis, and Ty. As a family we enjoy sports (mainly football), fishing, and the great outdoors. In my free time, I have a passion for reading, scrapbooking, watching movies, and spending time with family and friends.
Cornell Elementary School is a great place to teach and learn! I have been a teacher at Cornell since the fall of 2000. I have worked with various grade levels over the years. The last seven years focusing mainly with the upper elementary reading program. I'm an energetic and creative person who loves working with students! I like to make our experiences and investigations adventurous and bring new ideas into our classroom. I value my room as a place where students are able to express their ideas and feelings in a safe and respected way. It is my hope that all of the students, parents, and staff that I work with can tell how much I care about my students and their educational experience.
We will continue to work with our Math curriculum that we are really excited about! It is called Investigations and it has six major goals which guide the development of the curriculum.
Provide substantive work in important areas of mathematics—rational numbers, geometry, measurement, data, and early algebra—and connections among them
As a parent or caregiver, you are your child's first mathematics teacher. In fact, you have probably been doing math together since your child was very young. Counting pictures on a page and singing songs helped your child learn about numbers and counting. Building with objects such as blocks and cardboard boxes exposed your child to geometric ideas such as shape, size and symmetry. Chores such as putting away the dishes and sorting laundry engaged your child in sorting and categorizing, which are important features of data analysis. Once your child enters school, it is important to continue to support their growing understanding of mathematics. There are many different ways to help your child learn and appreciate mathematics, even if math was not your favorite subject in school. You can help your child by:

This list of surname biographies is a continual work in progress. As more surnames are researched and biographies written, they will be added to this page. The information contained in these biographies was obtained from a variety of sources both physical and online.
The information contained in these biographies was obtained at least from some of the following physical and online sources:
http://www.jewishworldreview.com -- LAST WEEK was a good one for Texas Gov. George W. Bush and a bad one for Vice President Al Gore, and it was reflected in the main national polls.
Over the week, the Gallup poll showed Gore's lead increasing from five points to 10 early last week, then closing down to just three at the end.
In the meantime, the Voter.com Battleground survey showed Bush increasing his lead from one point to five. The Zogby/Reuters poll showed Gore's lead dropping from seven points to four. And the Rasmussen Portrait of America poll showed Bush up by two.
The Bush campaign insists that all this means that the race is "statistically dead even," but when evidence from key-state polling is factored in, the presidential race looks close, but it's still tilting toward Gore. Bush has stopped making mistakes and Gore has started making some -- nuzzling Hollywood, fabricating facts about drug costs and playing politics with oil prices -- but as of the middle of last week, the advantage still seemed to be with Gore.
The Bush aides said their man was leading by seven points in Ohio, his best battleground state, but a Wayne State University/Detroit Free Press poll has his lead at just two. The same poll put Gore up by eight in Michigan and 18 in Pennsylvania, though another survey showed Gore ahead by just 3 there. Rasmussen Research, a GOP firm, showed that in Florida the candidates are running even, and Zogby had Gore leading by five in hotly contested Missouri.
Moreover, the fundamentals of the contest have changed. Before the national conventions, the underlying attitude of U.S. voters seemed to be that they didn't particularly like Gore, they thought of Bush as a better leader, and they wanted a change after eight years of Bill Clinton.
Since the conventions, polls show that Gore and Bush are viewed equally favorably: Gore has acquired leadership talents voters hadn't seen before (though Bush still leads), Clinton is less of an election factor, and "the issues" are in the forefront.
And on the issues that matter most to voters -- the economy, education, health care, Social Security and Medicare -- Gore is ahead.
According to the Pew Research Center, Gore is up by six points on education, whereas the candidates once were even. On keeping the economy strong, Gore is up by eight. On health and retirement issues, he leads by 19 and 17 points, respectively.
Bush has a right to lay claim to being the reformer -- the "big thinker," even -- in this race, with pioneering proposals on Social Security, taxes and Medicare reform.
On the other hand, he is very late in mounting the kind of systematic voter-education effort that his out-of-the-box ideas require. Without that education, those ideas have been a target for Gore's favorite attack word: "risky."
Bush did get a boost by having a bipartisan group, Economic Security 2000, give his Social Security plan high marks and blast Gore's plan for doing "nothing to reduce the $10.37 trillion Social Security deficits." The group, whose chairs include Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey, Neb., and Charles Stenholm, Texas, said that Bush's plan to allow individuals to invest part of their Social Security taxes in private markets was "bold and forward-looking" while Gore's "accounting defies credibility."
Bush last week also took quick advantage of Gore's proposal to use part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower high fuel oil prices in the Northeast.
Gore previously had opposed the idea as ineffective and, as the Wall Street Journal reported, it was opposed both by Treasury Sec. Larry Summers and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan because the reserve was designed for national security emergencies.
Bush pounced on oil prices as evidence of a "failed Clinton-Gore energy strategy" and criticized Gore for switching position on the reserve 47 days before the election.
Also last week, Bush performed winningly on Oprah Winfrey's show, which is widely watched by women voters -- a group that's shifted decisively to Gore since August.
The Battleground survey showed Gore ahead by seven points among women, while Gallup had his lead at 17, and Zogby, 11.
Gore got caught making up a story about how much his mother-in-law pays for an arthritis drug, but probably the most damaging event of the week was the hasty retreat he and his runningmate, Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., made from their previous threats to get tough with Hollywood.
At a glittery $4.2 million fund-raiser, Gore referred to the threats as "the controversy of the previous week" and Lieberman said he only meant to "nudge" Hollywood -- even though he has asked the Federal Communications Commission to investigate broadcasters for "the explosion of crude, rude and lewd material" carried in prime time. Bush accused Gore and Lieberman, in effect, of selling out their principles for big money. But it remains to be seen if he will press the attack.
Bush had a good week, but he needs more of them -- and a strong debate performance -- to regain the lead he once enjoyed.

The Sampler Crunch impulse response library has been expanded! I’ve added the Akai S1100 and the E-mu E4XT Ultra. The S1100 is the updated version of the S1000, but altogether it’s a completely different machine, redesigned from the ground up. This results in a cleaner sounding sampler with brilliant top-end. This has been captured in the impulse responses. The E-mu E4XT Ultra sampler has very fat lows and mids, great for hip-hop! These two machines complement each other nicely!
The samplers have been captured at different sample rates and input level settings, mono and stereo. Both samplers have built-in effect processors, these effects (reverb and delay) have been captured as IR’s as well. The effect IR’s from the E4XT Ultra are from the optional RFX-32 effects board.

According to Sportbible, the fans expressed their displeasure to the team on their arrival as they hauled stones at the team bus after touching down in Brazil from Russian Federation.
Whatever the outcome of England's semi-final, the team will remain in Russian Federation at the very least until next Saturday when the Third Place Play-Off is contested - the final will be played on Sunday 15 July.
Martinez urged his players not to waste the opportunity of a lifetime and become the first Belgian side to reach a World Cup final. "It is an opportunity in our careers and we have to grab it with both hands".

Kim has been training with us for 2 years now and has become a major part of the CFS family. She works her butt off in class everyday and has the greatest heart & personality imaginable!
Please congratulate Kim when you see her and prepare yourself to get NO REPPED by her (you won’t see it coming).
My first exposure to CFS was at boot camp in the fall of 2011. I really loved it; then, Nicolle bullied me until I came inside to the gym last winter.
I love interval workouts. Anything with running is great, except Nancy. I also like chipper style WODs with lots of different movements.
I’ve always been a runner and lover of the outdoors. Beyond a brief middle school foray into volleyball and basketball (which did not go well), I’ve tried to stay away from sports that involve any hand-eye coordination. I ran competitively (Cross-Country, Indoor Track and Outdoor Track) all 4 years of High School and College. Those 8 years of intense training and competition were fun, but I thought I was done with all of that hard work. CrossFit has been a whole new fitness adventure for me.
When I lived in NC, I had a great group of running friends. We ran in the early morning darkness every day, until they all ended up either pregnant or injured. I began to complain to my husband about not having anyone to run with in the morning. All the while, he was doing CrossFit and loving it. He tried to talk me into trying it for months, but I stubbornly refused (remember, I liked being outside, not in a gym). Finally, he wore me down, I tried a class and was hooked.
Unfortunately, the day I first went to CrossFit (at Metro Fitness in Charlotte, NC), I was the only person who showed up to class. Even more unfortunately, the WOD was 100 jumping pull-ups, 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, and 100 air squats. I tried to sneak out before class started. The Coach wouldn’t have it, so I stayed and did the workout alone. It was pretty awful at the time, but really awful in the days to follow when I couldn’t walk, lift my arms or sneeze. Nevertheless, I couldn’t wait to go back and try it again.
What sort of changes have you seen in your body, health and fitness since starting CF? (before / after)
I’ve always been really active and in decent cardio shape, but I have definitely noticed a marked improvement in my strength and general fitness. I feel like there are so many more things I can do easily. I feel stronger and more agile in daily activities and at the gym. A year ago, it was a struggle to do one or two un-banded pull-ups, and now I’ve worked my way up to almost 40. I’m not a great lifter, but weights that used to be completely impossible now seem do-able. I even feel stronger running, which is not a change I expected. I love tackling a workout that seems so daunting and impossible and coming out the other side completely spent but with a great feeling of accomplishment.
I attribute all of this improvement to being surrounded by amazing CFS coaches who really believe that I am capable of so much more than I ever think I am. They push me to do things that I would never think to try, and I have loved the challenge.
What sort of changes in your life have you experienced out of taking on something like CrossFit that were totally unexpected?
The whole experience of CrossFit has been an unexpected adventure. I approached it as a short-term solution until I could run with my friends again. I never imagined that I would enjoy it as much as I do and certainly didn’t expect it to be so addictive. As I tell anyone who asks, I love the intensity of the exercise but I keep coming back because of the amazing community of people surrounding me at CFS. The camaraderie and friendship that I’ve found among my fellow athletes at CFS and the passion, energy and commitment of Tayler, Sean, Becky, Greg, Nicolle and Emilio make it hard to stay away.
There are many, but I have to say the Crosstown Throwdown is a real highlight. Despite how brutal the workouts were (damn you, Sean) and how anxious the competitors were about being able to rise to the challenge, there was such a spirit of teamwork and camaraderie. The atmosphere was electric and exciting and the energy shared among the athletes and spectators made for a great experience.
Another favorite CrossFit memory: I remember the day I introduced my sister to CrossFit. She’s this phenomenal triathlete who has succeeded at all things athletic, but she had never done CrossFit. I took her to class with me one Saturday, and it happened to be a partner WOD. She punished me for an hour as we worked out together, but when that workout ended I remember the smile on her face. She was hooked – a new CrossFit addict. Since then, she has been certified as a Level 1 coach and opened the first CrossFit box in the mountains of NC. It’s been great fun sharing this pastime with her and comparing times and weights from afar.
Stick with it. I think the whole thing can seem overwhelming at times – all of the crazy lifts you are supposed to remember how to do, the weights you’re supposed to write down, the lingo, the intense demands on your body and psyche, but it does get easier and more fun. Trust that you really can do more than you think you can. Also, give your body time to recover so that you can keep demanding more of it.
I love to do anything that involves being outside – skiing, biking, sledding, running, playing sports with my kids. I have really loved watching my kids begin their own athletic careers. Watching them play soccer, lacrosse, basketball, ski and mountain bike is my favorite!

Since Jay has been ill, we have tried to keep our chins up. We try to get the idea of doctors, bills and co-pays, blood tests, appointments and no answers out of our minds...what better way than to go berry picking!?!?! Now, these pictures do not show many berries (if any) but it was a nice time...
All in all, nice day...when you come for a visit, ask about the jam...and maybe some pickled green (or white or purple) beans (I don't have a pressure canner yet to make reg canned green beans, acidity levels and all...) Stop in sometime and enjoy! We'll keep the kettle on for you! =)
aww these are great pictures. I love CO this time of year. It is so pretty and scenic and Colorado-ee... :) Yay for berries!
I was thinking the other night that we are all like a caterpillar, here in this life. We have our fleshly needs, our simple understanding, as we amble along. We are drawn toward becoming fattened; metaphorically, with life, love, and wisdom. As we find ourselves turing inward, this is the moment where a caterpillar begins its cocoon. As we rest and conserve, there is a sense of contemplation, solitude, and growth. In leaps and bounds, our souls are transformed, as in the last days of our lives, we attune our sensibility to the next step in what will become of us. As we are closer to the release, the cocoon provides a more lucid view of that which is around, while still a part of the same body we once knew. The pupa fades away into a life reborn into its eternity. The soul flies away, on the wings of the butterfly, whether it is fed on the fruits of wisdom and love, or ignorance.
This caterpillar's life is the tangible function, like the humanity wherein we are clothed. It is like the veil in which we are draped before we become a butterfly, as our bodies are released from one corporal life, into the spiritual. We do not always know what awaits us, but we can be certain, it will be more than we ever imagined, because how can a caterpillar expect to understand flight, until it goes to its tomb inside the chrysalis? So too, a human cannot conceive of the immeasurable life beyond our flesh, without first dying to this life, to become ready for flight.

Philippo di Vadi Pisano was a 15th century Italian fencing master. His name signifies that he was born in Pisa, a city in northern Italy, but little else can be said with certainty about the life of this master. It may be that he was the same Philippo Vadi who was governor of Reggio under the marquisette of Leonello d’Este and later, from 1452 to 1470, counselor to Borso d’Este, Duke of Ferrara.[1] Some time after this, Vadi composed a treatise on fencing entitled De Arte Gladiatoria Dimicandi ("On the Art of Swordsmanship"); it was dedicated to Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino,[2] and gifted to him between 1482 and 1487,[3] but while this may indicate that he served the duke after leaving Ferrara, there is no record of a Master Vadi being attached to the ducal court.
Vadi was probably an initiate of the tradition of Fiore de’i Liberi, as both his teachings and the format of his treatise closely resemble those of the earlier master. As both Leonello and Borso were sons of Niccolò III d’Este, owner of two copies of Fiore's treatise Fior di Battaglia, Vadi would have had ample opportunity to study his writings.
Having been drawn to warlike acts and things by my earnest spirit, devoid of all cowardice, since my firstthriving years, as time progressed I grew in strength and knowledge I went, through hard work, to learn something of the art, its style and skills, regarding the aforementioned warlike acts and things. Such as how to play with the sword, lance, dagger and axe.
The Vivo V9 is going to have a large 6.3-inch edge to edge, full HD+ display and it will have an aspect ratio of 19:9 and as mentioned, the notch to accommodate the selfie camera. Partnered with Snapdragon 626 octa-core SoC. The phone will have 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage. The Android Oreo, version 8.0 will be the processor and Vivo’s FunTouch OS 4.0 will be the UI skin on top.
There is some similarity in the camera setup style between the Vivo V9 and the iPhone X as well. Vertically stacked in the rear are the dual 12MP+5MP cameras and the front selfie camera is a much larger 24MP, in line with Vivo’s positioning its phones as selfie specialist smartphones. Coming to the battery backup it comes with a 3260mAh battery. There is also a mention of an AI camera giving a hint that the user can expect AI to play a key role in the technology behind the operation of the cameras as well.
The expected price of the Vivo V9 is Rs 24,999 and Amazon may include some offers to signify the launch of the device.
Also,Vivo has also appointed a new brand ambassador for the Indian market, with actor Aamir Khan replacing Ranveer Singh, another actor.

Huawei’s sub-brand Honor has launched a new Honor smartphone dubbed as Honor 9 Lite with four cameras in India. The new Honor 9 Lite is the toned-down version of the Honor 9 that was launched with dual front and rear cameras in October last year.
Honor had already unveiled the Honor 9 Lite in China back in December 2017. At the time of its launch, Huawei mentioned that it would launch the phone in 14 more countries including India. Now, the company has launched the Honor 9 Lite in India priced at Rs. 10,999 for the base variant. It is a Flipkart Exclusive and will go on sale via Flash sales starting on January 21, 2018.
The 9 Lite shares most of its internals with its budget siblings. For the Chipset, we have a Kirin 659 octa-core. There are two variants with different RAM and storage combinations viz. 3GB/32GB and 4GB/64GB. Storage is expandable, and 4G and VoLTE both are supported. Due to the relatively small screen size, the battery has been shrunken down a bit to 3000mAh, but Honor still claims that the 9 Lite can deliver a full day’s worth of battery life.
The cameras are of course the main highlight here. Honor has fitted both the front and rear 13-MP sensors with secondary 2-MP depth sensors. These should let you perform tricks like adding portrait effects when shooting with either set of cameras. The rear camera also boats of PDAF for quick focusing.

In preparation for our 2A Films screening of The Cobweb, I took the opportunity to work my way through some of Vincente Minnelli’s extensive filmography. I didn’t see them all – Minnelli made some 34 feature films and a fair few remain unavailable in the UK – but it was a spectacular ride all the same. Read a round-up of the ones I did see here.
Together with Billy Launder, I have established 2A Films, a repertory cinema programming initiative focusing on lesser-known and lesser-seen films.
Our first event was a 35mm presentation of Simon and Laura (Muriel Box, 1955) at the Cinema Museum. This was for Scalarama 2016 and the film was introduced by Josephine Botting, Fiction Curator at the BFI.
Our next event is The Cobweb (Vincente Minnelli, 1955) at Genesis Cinema on 26th January. The film is screening from 35mm and will be introduced by Professor Peter William Evans, Emeritus Professor of Film Studies at Queen Mary University of London.

Study on physico-chemical properties of emulsion type sausage produced with aqueous extract of Biarum carduchcorum tenderizied meat
4Associate Professor, Department of Food Hygiene, School of Veterinary Medicine, Shiraz University, Iran
In order to improve the quality of meat such as tenderness, protein solubility, emulsification and water holding capacity, in the food industries, various methods have been employed. Application of the plant enzymes is considered as one of the most efficient methods for meat tenderization. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the characteristics of emulsion type sausage made from tenderized cattle meat by hydro extract of Biarum carduchcorum. The proteolytic activity of the extract was determined using bovine milk casein as substrate. Post rigor thigh meat were tenderized by 100 and 150 enzyme units/ kg of the extract before used for production of sausage. Fresh post rigor thigh meat was used as control. Nitrogen solubility index (NSI), stability of sausage emulsion, texture analysis and organoleptic properties of sausages were determined. Our results showed a significant increase in the NSI of the experimental groups compared with the control (P<0.05). Such increase was also considerable when the enzyme concentration and the exposure time were increased. Stability of the emulsion of sausage was also significantly increased. Even though, the tenderness and emulsifying power were improved, texture and organoleptic properties of the final products were not affected. Our study showed that Biarum carduchcorum is a proper tenderizing agent to employ in meat industries.

Clicking on one of those will center on that item, and another set of “neighbors” will come into view, allowing you to navigate around exploring by similar artists, songs, or users. Speaking of users, the Zune “Social” is also great fun, letting you find others with shared tastes and becoming friends with them. You then can listen to a playlist created based on an amalgamation of what all your friends are listening to, which is also enjoyable. Those concerned with privacy will be relieved to know you can prevent the public from seeing your personal listening habits if you so choose.

More triangle cushions, this time inspired by the Nani Marquina Digit Rugs. Some lessons learned about representing pixelisation too... it really doesn't work unless you're using tiny squares ;)
The first one took forever, playing around with placement. I ended up having one of each colour in the rug (it didn't really work but I like the rainbow freshness of it). For the second I took the main colours and tried to show the gradation.
I found a cork board and have been pinning my completed triangles there to get a better sense of what I have and possibilities for colour combination.
This triangle thing is going to go on for a while I think. Visit the Our Creative Spaces sign up page to see more varied wares ;) Thanks to Kirsty for making it all possible.
You do realise, that if anyone ever designed you a logo, there would have to be a triangle involved?
the triangles are so cool. especially love the cork board layout. also love your mod crochet from the last post.
I love seeing how your triangles are progressing!! Love the colours you are using I think they both look great! Very cool idea using a cork board! :)
thanks for your comment on my blog. i love that fabric too. its an off-cut i picked up 4 years ago at a japanese store in richmond, victoria — ziguzagu. i must go back one day soon!
I've been missing out on so much while being internet-less! Should be getting my new laptop next week. Hooray!
I love the way the triangles fit together to make bigger shapes, the way the colour placement affects the greater pictre and the wooly texture.
What can I say???? I love these so much. The one at top has the perfect colours, triangles soooo cool. Can't wait to see them as cushions.
You've been so busy since I last popped by (forgive me!). Loving the triangle cushions and Nani Marquina's Digit Rugs are a brilliant inspiration (would love one of your cushions and one of her rugs!!)
Oh, amazing! I just finished a cushion of squares knitted like this, but triangles are so much more fun! Very inspiring :)
Ooowwww they look fab, love all the colors :) Thank you for your lovely comment the other day, sorry it's taken me an age to get back (new baby and all!) Take care, Sarah
This ca,e out so well! Please PLEEEEASE can you tell me how you joined the triangles so neatly.I have all these triangles and no idea how to join them :(
I sell a pattern on my Etsy store where I explain how to make this cushion, including how to join the triangles. You can find it here:

For each picture that you can correctly identify and write one sentence about, you will receive one point of extra credit. For the one sentence that you write about it, you must give some fact that makes whatever is in the picture noteworthy or important. There will be about thirteen pictures relating to this class, which means that you can earn as many as thirteen points for identifying pictures.
2. A second way to gain extra credit points is to complete a two-three page written summary of an article or source that you find in Shawnee's library which relates to a unit we are covering in some way. In this summary, you must, of course, summarize the article but you also need to say how in ties in to a class unit and give your appraisal/opinion of the article. You can do as many as four of these (each are worth 5 points) but can do no more than two per unit. Each summary is due at the end of the unit it relates to. If you have any questions about if a particular article can be used, make sure to ask me. I also have several articles that I can suggest for you to use.
3. Another way to earn extra credit will from the Jeopardy! review sessions we hold in class. We will play Jeopardy! twice during the semester as a class and both times each team will earn some points, depending on how well they do.
4. The final way to earn extra credit will be from the PreTest given to you the second day of class. Whatever points you earn from the PreTest will count as extra credit and you will have the option to improve on this score by taking the PreTest as a PostTest at the end of class. However, it will be up to you to tell me that you want to take the PreTest again during finals week if you would like to exercise this option for extra credit. You can earn as many as 25 points of extra credit during the course of the semester.
A tax-exempt deferred compensation program made available to employees of state and federal governments and agencies. A 457 plan is similar to a 401(k) plan, except there are never employer matching contributions and the IRS does not consider it a qualified retirement plan. Participants can defer some of their annual income (up to an annual limit), and contributions and earnings are tax-deferred until withdrawal.
Thank you for the sensible critique. Me and my neighbor were just preparing to do some research about this. We got a grab a book from our area library but I think I learned more clear from this post. I am very glad to see such excellent information being shared freely out there.
I’m still learning from you, as I’m trying to achieve my goals. I definitely enjoy reading everything that is posted on your website.Keep the aarticles coming. I liked it!
The journey of finding a job today is less difficult than you might suspect. Irrespective of whether you're endeavoring to find work opportunities on a local level, or you're simply concerned with several jobs that enable you to work at home, locating these employment opportunities have never been easier, if, of course, you know where to search. In fact, the benevolent internet offers you the one of a kind chance to make full use of your resume by submitting it on specialized sites.
Do not think that just because you're currently out-of-work that means that you should be spending less time slogging to get yourself a job than many others are spending on their real jobs. Remember to look at your current state of living unemployed as a job in itself, one that you've got to get over with as fast as possible. In order to accomplish this, you must dedicate no less than 6 to 8 hours of each business day for distributing job programs , going to interviews and connecting with several people and potential employers. Your main goal ought to be to apply to at least 3 jobs each day. It would also be a very clever idea to establish a contact list containing everyone you interact with in this procedure. This strategy is guaranteed to reward you with a job sooner than you expect.
Assuming you are an employee, then it is best That you don't search for another job yet, because finding new work opportunities takes time. However, in case it is crucial that you find a new place to work at, it will a little more problematic to find the essential time to search for jobs. In such circumstances, you should book any spare time to your quest for jobs.
Before running into any hardships, you got to ask Yourself: what sort of job are you seeking? For instance, I recently had a talk with my teenager daughter and because she's close to graduating, I asked her what career path does she want to follow. To my surprise, she looked at me dead serious and said she wants to be the boss of a grand, billion dollar business. Then she asked me how can she do that right now? After a couple of minutes of being lost for words, I finally giggled. I sincerely find it difficult to understand what kids are thinking these days. I looked back at her and without stuttering I just let her know that she can't. I explained that she has to get a college education, earn a bachelor's degree, and ideally a master's too. Just after those steps she will be able to find an entry level job in a potentially huge enterprise, and then continue to climb the ladder from there. She glared at me thinking I was mad. All things considered, in reality one doesn't simply finish high school and expect to become the head of such a large business immediately. No matter how excellent that sounds, it's just absurd.
Finding work online is made incredibly straightforward by the designers of job posting sites. Through job posting websites, users that are looking for work can easily find what they're interested in by making use of all of the searching tools that are made available for them. For example, job seekers can narrow their search to a specific region, a certain position, or on the contrary expand their hunt with broad keywords that are relevant to the kind of service they are looking for. Even more so, multiple job posting websites assist you with some sort of job search agent; the mission of these agents is to notify you every time an offer that matches your pre-established criteria has been listed.
On the occasion that you are more interested in freelance work, finding an internet job is not as complicated either. You almost have dozens if not hundreds of web pages at your fingertips that provide an excellent source of online jobs that don't need any fixed schedule and may be performed exclusively by the comfort of your residence. Some of the web pages even enable employers to list offers so that more freelancers can place a bid on them.
Another brilliant idea to remember when you deal with your quest for work opportunities on the internet is to check multiple local college sites. School websites will regularly list various openings accessible at the college or at the university. If that doesn't happen, then at least you will stay informed about if job fairs occur, so you could show up there holding your resume.
All in all, the World Wide Web could be your most Precious assistant when attempting to discover jobs online. You can always come across plenty of websites that will enable you to expose your resume on the web so that different companies can analyze your experience and possibly hire you, or you can stroll through dozens of job offers with the assistance of an effective search engine incorporated on these sites. More importantly, you won't have to remain at the mercy of classic job hunting methods and as a result of that, you're radically improving your chances of finding the job you're entitled to!
You ought to be conscious of your abilities. Be Conscious of The abilities you have and the level you have the ability to perform at. Be reasonable when you analyze yourself, nor minimalize your expertise. Know your value, but also set the lowest (pay) you are prepared to accept.
It is critical to know your assortment of abilities. Once you understand this information, it'll be easier to assess the spot you're looking for. You see, it is not always about the boss finding the perfect match for the available position, but it's also about you fitting right in. Inquire about the wage for your position by visiting sites like PayScale.com, or Salary.com and SalaryExpert.com. As soon as you are accustomed to the payment, you'd want to remain at least $5000 within that area (e.g. in the event the wage for the activity is predicted to gravitate around $45,000, then you ought to consider offers within the array of $40,000 to $45,000, respectively $45,000 to $50,000, conditioned by the level of your expertise in that domain).
As an extra to a printed curriculum vitae, numerous individuals that are engaged in jobs pursuit come to the conclusion that list their resume and portfolio online are both extremely useful when it comes to helping them discover and start a new career. Specially projected for prospective employers to view, jobs the vast majority of resume posters are not bothered with their position within the search engine, but instead a professional outlook to help with their tasks pursuit.
There are various online job banks (sometimes called job boards) you can use today, such as http://monster.com, where career seekers receive help in their quest for jobs. People have the choice to post a resume with the job board or submit their personal copy straight to the possible employer. The best amount of jobs posted online demand computer and internet experience and many times people decide that having their personal web portfolio helps in their tasks pursuit.
In regards to people engaged in a jobs search, the resume will provide prospective employers their first glance at your abilities. Prior educational experience, credentials and work history are among the very important details to highlight. Among the most crucial online certification sites, http://BrainBench.com that is, provides 3-year credentials upon successfully completing an online test. Available to people of all kinds, including individuals engaged in a jobs search, every single test offers instantaneous results and the right to add a certification on a resume. Free of charge tests can be found each month for subjects such as math, programming, computer principles, typing, business, legal and medical terminology and so forth. These supplementary qualifications are always welcome as they add veracity to a resume and may even uphold one's likelihood in a jobs search.
In the events that a meeting is accorded, candidates must dress properly to be able to correspond to the position they apply for. The dress code is very important, but keeping up a friendly yet agreeable attitude is also indicated. Instead of too praising your potential new boss, which by the way is a quick red flag to most employers, jobs search candidates are advised to act like they were in the presence of a friend. Over the length of the interview, applicants must convince their potential employer of how personable they are and how they can add value to the team.
Definitely the most effective method to build a touch network is by calling the recruiter or employer straightforwardly. The contact information is typically made known when you apply for work online. If you visit a job bank site such as: CareerBuilder.com or Monster.com, or a niche-oriented job board such as: DataCenterLife.com, then it is very likely that the contact info can be found on the job offer page. If, however, you want to apply directly through an employer's site, then most likely you can get the contact information under the"Contacts", or"Contact Us" tag.
Merely because you're currently out of work does not Imply that your skills aren't needed somewhere. And it definitely does not mean that you need to fall behind in your field of work. To the contrary, you should still be interested in whatever happens in your business and spend your time effectively. Research your area of work market and learn about the latest technologies in the respective domain. What's to attend an interview if you'll have no idea what they will be talking about? Stay updated, stay informed and know your stuff. You might not become an expert at it overnight, but any piece of knowledge helps.
Remember the saying that goes: "first impression is the most lasting"? You only have one shot to make a excellent impression. It would be a terrible shame to waste it. Don't think about picking up the phone if you're too busy to have a proper conversation. So in case you find an unknown amount calling, just presume it's a recruiter or an employer and you should under no circumstances response, if you're too occupied. There's nothing more embarrassing than the sound of a toilet flush, or a baby crying his eyes out, or a third party conversation going on in the background right when a potential employer or recruiter calls. In such cases, it's better that you do not pick up the call until you are back in a quiet place and you are calm, concentrated, composed and prepared to reply to all questions in a clear manner.
Job hunting can become quite stressful after a while. Give yourself a break and take your time during weekends to recharge your batteries and kick out the anxiety. I recommend taking off Fridays also. The only situation in which you should schedule interviews on Friday is when the recruiter or the employer schedules it on Friday. Also, keep your phone close just in case a possible employer decides to call, but don't forget the advice above and don't answer if you're too busy to talk. Rather, let your voice mail service handle the situation until you become accessible again.
Earning that job interview is what you strived so hard for. The achievement of a meeting is as crucial as getting the job . This instant settles everything. The second you're scheduled for a meeting is the second you have to begin with the preparation for the interview. Do your homework about the history and background of the company. It's ideal that you're accustomed with what the company does and how it operates. Usually this information is available right on their web address, but sometimes it's deeply buried within the pages of the website, so you may need to do some digging. Think of questions and ask your interviewer about the company, about the position you're about to get, or anything else you should know. Oh, and do not forget to rest well the night before. At least 7-8 hours of sleep would be perfect.
You should own at least 2 business attires. In case You have a second interview, you should be capable of switching to another suit. They do not have to be all fancy, but at least have a more sober look. Colors like black, gray, or navy are favored. Be careful to be well groomed as well.
After the interview starts, unwind and be your genuine self. Leave your worries behind and instead focus on articulating your words and thoughts in a coherent way. Ask about the workplace, about the position you're applying for and also, out of courtesy, inquire about their position and the period of time they been in the business. Try to find out how come the spot is open and why did the former employee leave in the first place.
Do not forget to be authentic, display a friendly figure and keep in mind that the interviewer is only human, same as you. Even if you don't obtain the job, do not panic and don't let yourself down. Take the experience as a lesson and try all over again, until you eventually succeed -- because you will. More often than not, the interview is only a presentation of your personality and personality. If you genuinely and suitably exposed your abilities in your resume, then the employer already knows what you are capable of.
Full year and fourth quarter earnings of $3.00 and $1.55 per diluted share, respectively; full year adjusted diluted earnings $3.94 per share; fourth quarter 2015 adjusted diluted earnings of $1.03 per share

Fourth quarter 2014 included a MTM actuarial loss of $0.91 per diluted share, which reflected actuarial assumptions at the time of the remeasurement. Fourth quarter 2015 adjusted earnings were $116.2 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to $77.4 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2014 (see notes to the condensed consolidated financial information). The Company reported net sales of $930.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, up from net sales of $598.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, driven primarily by the acquisition of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. ("Rockwood"), which closed January 12, 2015, partly offset by the impact of lower sales volumes, unfavorable price and mix impacts in some businesses and unfavorable currency exchange impacts.
Earnings for the full year 2015 were $334.9 million, or $3.00 per diluted share, compared to $133.3 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, for the full year 2014. Adjusted earnings for the full year 2015 (including $52.4 million in non-cash currency exchange transaction gains from the first quarter) were $439.4 million, or $3.94 per diluted share, compared to $332.1 million, or $4.20 per diluted share, for the full year 2014. Net sales for the full year 2015 were $3.65 billion, up from net sales of $2.45 billion, driven primarily by the acquisition of Rockwood, partly offset by the impact of lower sales volumes, unfavorable price and mix impacts in certain businesses and unfavorable currency exchange impacts.
"In 2015, we began the transformation of Albemarle with the acquisition of Rockwood and delivered on our commitments to our shareholders," said Luke Kissam, president and CEO. "The lithium and surface treatment businesses we acquired in January exceeded profitability expectations for the year, resulting in adjusted EBITDA for the company of $959 million and 6% growth over 2014. Cash generation was as expected, and the $60 million of synergies achieved exceeded our goal at the beginning of the year. We completed the sale of two non-core businesses and used the proceeds to pay down debt by over $300 million in early 2016. We achieved our goals for 2015 and are well positioned to grow in 2016. Our goals for 2016 are clear: deliver the forecasted free cash flow to enable further deleveraging, continue to drive synergy savings and convert the recently announced memorandum of understanding related to our lithium concession in Chile to a definitive agreement."
The acquisition of Rockwood was completed on January 12, 2015 for a purchase price of approximately $5.7 billion. The cash consideration was funded with proceeds from senior notes the Company issued in 2014 and borrowings under the Company's term loan credit agreement, cash bridge facility and revolving credit agreement.

Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by $1.0 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts as compared to the prior year.

Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by $5.8 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts as compared to the prior year.

All Other net sales were $133.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of 8.1% from pro forma net sales of $123.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.

In summary, total net sales of $930.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a decrease of $19.9 million or 2.1% from fourth quarter 2014 pro forma net sales of $950.3 million, was unfavorably impacted by currency exchange of $45.2 million. Excluding currency exchange impacts, net sales for the period would have been up 2.7% as compared to the prior year. Total adjusted EBITDA of $228.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, an increase of $3.1 million or 1.4% from fourth quarter 2014 pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $225.5 million, was unfavorably impacted by currency exchange of $10.9 million (including $0.9 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts on Corporate results). Excluding currency exchange impacts, adjusted EBITDA for the period would have been up 6.2% as compared to the prior year.
Corporate adjusted EBITDA was ($22.3) million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to ($27.4) million pro forma adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $5.1 million improvement is primarily related to achieved synergies.
Our adjusted effective income tax rates, which exclude discontinued operations, special and non-operating pension and OPEB items, were 18.8% and 24.0% for the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our effective tax rate continues to be influenced by the level and geographic mix of income, and benefits from a favorable mix of income in lower tax jurisdictions. The effective tax rate decrease compared to the prior year is driven by a variety of factors including mix of income and planning related to the Rockwood acquisition.
Our cash flow from operations was approximately $360.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, down 27% versus the same period in 2014, primarily due to significant cash expenses in the current period related to the Rockwood acquisition, including acquisition fees, interest payments, costs to deliver synergy projects, and tax payments to repatriate cash from overseas. We had $213.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015, as compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2014. Cash on hand, cash provided by operations, a return of capital from an unconsolidated investment and proceeds from borrowings, funded $2.1 billion for acquisitions, $227.6 million of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment and dividends to shareholders of $119.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2015.
2015 ended, and 2016 has begun, with much increased economic uncertainty. Nevertheless, we currently expect growth in most of our businesses in 2016. Full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range from $900 million to $950 million; adjusted EPS is expected to be $3.45 to $3.80, which would result in an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 28%. Reported free cash flow is expected to range from $450 million to $550 million.

Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated investments
See accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial information and non-GAAP reconciliations below.
(a) Non-operating pension and OPEB items, consisting of MTM actuarial gains/losses, settlements/curtailments, interest cost and expected return on assets, are not allocated to our reportable segments and are included in the Corporate category. Although non-operating pension and OPEB items are included in Cost of goods sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses in accordance with GAAP, we believe that these components of pension cost are mainly driven by market performance, and we manage these separately from the operational performance of our businesses. Non-operating pension and OPEB items included in Cost of goods sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses were as follows (in millions):
The MTM actuarial (gain) loss was ($38.9) million and $112.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and ($38.9) million and $130.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and resulted from the annual remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans in the fourth quarter. MTM actuarial gains/losses recorded in the fourth quarter may differ from the year-to-date amounts to the extent that remeasurements occurred in previous quarters. Settlements/curtailments for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from the termination of a domestic OPEB plan during the first quarter of 2015.
(b) In addition to the non-operating pension and OPEB items disclosed above, we have identified certain other items and excluded them from our adjusted earnings calculation for the periods presented. A listing of these items, as well as a detailed description of each follows below (per diluted share):
(1) In connection with the acquisition of Rockwood, the Company valued Rockwood's existing inventory at fair value as of the acquisition date, which resulted in a markup of the underlying net book value of the inventory. The inventory markup was expensed over the estimated remaining selling period. For the three months ended December 31, 2015, $0.5 million was included in Cost of goods sold and Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was reduced by $0.2 million related to the utilization of the inventory markup. For the year ended December 31, 2015, $75.9 million ($54.1 million after income taxes, or $0.49 per share) was included in Cost of goods sold, and Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was reduced by $27.1 million ($0.24 per share), related to the utilization of the inventory markup.
A gain of $6.8 million ($5.4 million after income taxes, or $0.05 per share) recognized upon the sale of land in Avonmouth, UK, which was utilized by the phosphorus flame retardants business we exited in 2012.
Net charges of $6.5 million ($4.3 million after income taxes, or $0.05 per share) in connection with a reduction of aluminum alkyls high cost supply capacity, and net adjustments of ($1.2) million ($0.9 million after income taxes, or $0.01 per share) associated with the finalization of the workforce reduction plan initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013.

$14.3 million directly related to the acquisition of Rockwood and $0.8 million in connection with other significant projects. After income taxes, these charges totaled $9.5 million, or $0.12 per share.
$137.7 million directly related to the acquisition of Rockwood and $8.4 million in connection with other significant projects. After income taxes, these charges totaled $94.4 million, or $0.84 per share.

Included in Other (expenses) income, net, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2014 is ($10.7) million ($6.7 million after income taxes, or $0.08 per share) and ($17.7) million ($11.2 million after income taxes, or $0.14 per share), respectively, for amortization of bridge facility fees and other financing fees related to the acquisition of Rockwood as well as $0.2 million ($0.1 million after income taxes) in each period for interest income earned on the cash proceeds from the new senior notes issued in connection with the acquisition of Rockwood.
(6) Included in Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments (net of tax) for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 is an impairment charge of $2.0 million ($0.02 per share) related to our unconsolidated investment in Fábrica Carioca de Catalisadores SA.
(7) Included in Interest and financing expenses for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 is loss on early extinguishment of $5.4 million ($3.5 million after income taxes, or $0.03 per share) related to the redemption of senior notes issued by the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Rockwood Specialties Group, Inc.
(8) Included in Income tax (benefit) expense for the three months and year ended December 31, 2015 is ($44.6) million, or ($0.40) per share, primarily related to the release of certain tax reserves associated with lapses in statutes of limitations and audit closures. Included in Income tax (benefit) expense for the three months and year ended December 31, 2014 is $1.6 million, or $0.02 per share, of income tax expense associated with the restructure of a Brazilian entity in anticipation of the acquisition of Rockwood. Also included in Income tax (benefit) expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 are discrete net tax benefit items of ($2.1) million, or ($0.03) per share, related principally to the release of certain tax reserves associated with lapses in statutes of limitations.

Financial results of the disposed group have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for the 2014 periods. Included in Loss from discontinued operations are pre-tax charges of $85.5 million ($65.7 million after income taxes, or $0.83 per share) recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to the loss on the sale of the disposed group, representing the difference between the carrying value of the related assets and their fair value as determined by the sales price less estimated costs to sell. The loss is primarily attributable to the write-off of goodwill, intangibles and long-lived assets, net of cumulative foreign currency translation gains of $17.8 million.

Whether I like it or not, postnatal depression is a part of my parenting story. It’s not a part I expected, and it’s certainly not a part that I like, but it’s there.
If you want to read my story about it, then you can so here. Or, you can watch myself, Rachel and Isabelle talking about postnatal depression on This Morning:
Suffice to say, that was pretty surreal being on day time television. I really didn’t want to do it, but I also understand that my postnatal depression is in my past. For others, it’s either in their future or an overwhelming part of their present. So all I can do at this point is try and impart some ‘wisdom’ to try to help others.
That’s why I started the Postnatal Depression Toolkit. I’m not sure exactly how useful it is, but it’s my attempt at trying to give back and present my advice in a single place with as many things as I can think of to help someone through it.
For me, there wasn’t one thing alone that helped my recovery. It was a massive combination of things. Changing my mindset, babywearing, going to baby groups, medication (at least at first), going away with Isabelle, involving myself as much as I could, keeping my diet on track, yoga, meditation, keeping things in perspective, and a whole lot more that I will eventually get around to writing about. My point here is that you need to try as many things as you can so they all prop each other up. You can’t rely on one thing and hope for the best.
If you are struggling with postnatal depression please do something about it. Don’t just read this and move on. You have to talk about it with someone. It doesn’t matter who. It can be your partner, if you’re in a relationship, a family member, a doctor, people online or even me. You can message me if you want to, I might take a while to reply, and I might not be able to help you all that much, but I am here.
Isablog was started when our daughter (called Isabelle, hence the name) was roughly four months old. It was started to talk about postnatal depression, something that I suffered when she was born. These days it's about much more than just that.
Date and Time: Thursday, December 13, 3:00pm – 5:00pm, There will also be social/networking time starting at 2:30
Summary: Ethical dilemmas are those moments that pit the things we value against each other. Identifying those values – and their worth – is at the heart of working through these challenges, but each of us does it in a slightly different way. In this training we’ll discuss values, ethical approaches, and workshop how those things lead to our individual behaviors. We all can be a little more mindful of the approaches we take and the implications that each has on what we choose to do

Stay tuned, there are many more of my works in progress to come. Denny
This is a commission piece. This is Rick Scruggs from Duncan, South Carolina. Rick has been riding since the age of two. He specializes in team roping and calf roping. His mother was gifting this painting to Rick's father. Rick is posed with his favorite saddle that his father bought for him. It's a high-end Courts roping saddle handmade by a company called McMaster Custom Tack in Texas. This painting is traditional oils on museum-grade Masonite. The finished size is 24" x 20". Here is version one. I am giving you a close-up first since I am working just the face area. This is day two. I have smoothed out the flesh and hat while adding more detail to the face and hat. On the second day, the paint sets up and makes it easy to use a dry brush to blend and smooth everything out. Here is a close-up of version two. Day three. I pretty much finished detailing his face and managed to get the Courts saddle roughed in. Day four. I’m still working all of the saddle detail. I just love painting leather and metal! Day five. The saddle is just about complete. You can even see…
This is my good friend and hunting buddy, Sheldon Hanson. He is also my neighbor here in Cody, Wyoming. I have him and his horse, Junior posed in front of the famous Grand Teton Mountains in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This painting is traditional oils on museum-grade Masonite and the finished size is 18" x 24". Here is day two. Day three. I finally got all the details finished on the mountain tops as well the area below which are actually trees, high meadows and rock formations. Where the trees stop is the tree line, which in the Rocky Mountains, usually stops in the 9000 feet above sea level range. As you can see, I got Sheldon's face roughed in. On this version, I laid down the base coat for Sheldon's horse and added the rifle scabbard. I also finished detailing his face, beard and hat. I have Junior's head just about done. I will then move over to Sheldon's shirt for the next go around. I laid in the base coat for Sheldon's leather shirt and pants. This was about a day and a half worth of work. On this version, it took several days to add all the textures,…
This is my good friend Dustin Roush from Gillette, Wyoming. Dustin posed for Leigh and I in July of 2006 at the DC Bar Guest Ranch, my friend's ranch in Pinedale, Wyoming. Dustin and his family operate a very large beef cattle ranch in Gillette. Dustin was completing "guide school" classes at the time so he can work as a licensed hunting guide in the state of Wyoming. Dustin is a "master" with a lasso. He was giving lessons to all the other students. What a great kid he is as well as a pure gentleman. Here is the first day's work. This is a rough base coat. Here is day two. I have added more detail to Dustin's face, Stetson, shirt and hands. I was able to lay in the base coat for the upper part of his jeans. This is a close-up of that area. This is day three. I finished the base coat for his jeans and boots. On day four I finished detailing his jeans and boots. I have also roughed in his lasso and the dirt at his feet. This is a close-up of that area. This is day five. I have pretty much finished…
This piece is titled Spirit, Horse, Hunter. My model's name is Richard Ashburn. He is a guide from Jackson Hole, Wyoming. He actually has lived the life of an actual mountain man for over thirty years. The piece is traditional oils on the Ampersand Gessobord Masonite. The size is 18" x 24". The reference photograph used was taken by my wife, Leigh. It was taken at the Mountain Man Rendezvous in July 2006, Pinedale, Wyoming. Here is version one. This is version two. In Richard's hand is his custom made English Pattern Henry rifle built for him by Steve Hill. To read more about Steve Hill, Larry Walker and their outstanding works of art, check this link: http://web.mac.com/j.henry.artificers/ This is version three. There was still a lot of detailing to be done, especially on his left chest, left arm, left hand and left knee area. BTW, I have never seen so much fringe on a person! On version four, I have added a lot more fine detail all over Richard, his rifle and clothing. I also painted in the stretched beaver pelt at his feet. Here is the final. To see some of the detailed areas, here are three close-up…
This is my third painting of my good friend, Sheldon Hanson. It is traditional oils on Ampersand Gessobord. The overall size is 11" x 14". I painted in the background awhile back to make sure that it was dry. This is day one of my work in progress. Here I painted in the base coat for his coyote skin cap. I had Sheldon pose in an old, full length, buffalo skin robe. He was wearing a full coyote skin cap while holding his favorite flintlock rifle. Here is day two. I have added more detail to Sheldon's coyote skin cap. I will add some more detail after that paint dries. I have roughed in his face and beard. There is still quite a bit of detail to be added here once the base coat sets up over night. This is day three. I added a little more base coat to Sheldon's beard. After it dries, I will start to paint in the actual hairs. I roughed in the collar on his buffalo skin coat and his leather fringed shirt. The dark red piece of cloth with the brass ring is what holds the eagle feather that is lying on his…
This is bronze artist extraordinaire, Don Hershberger. Don is 55 years old when I painted him in 2008. He lives in nearby, Clark, Wyoming. Don has lived the lived of a cowboy here in Wyoming for many, many years but he has always found the time to create. His bronze work consists of cowboys, horses, Native Americans and wild animals from the area. One other interesting fact about Don is that he is a cowboy preacher. Here is day one. I posed Don on his ranch in Clark. He is holding his favorite lasso, leaning against his classic buck rail fence. The piece is traditional oils on Ampersand, Gessobord Masonite. The overall size is 18" x 24". Here is a close-up of his face. Here is day two's work. The hand and shirt are still pretty rough. These are two items that I have to let set up over night then work all the detail on top the next day. I spent most of the day detailing Don's shirt and hand and I am still not quite done. There is still quite a bit of detailing to do once the paint dries more, stitches, highlights and so on. Day four.…
This is my good friend, Gordon Bond of Land Of Lakes, Florida. Shiloh Jasper Green as he calls himself, is a member of S.A.S.S aka the Single Action Shooting Society that is a national group who are quick draw artists and shooting competitors. Here is day one. This is a 16" x 20" portrait with the background roughed in. I am painting with traditional oils. This painting is on museum-grade Masonite made by Ampersand. It has a white, textured clay surface and covered with white gesso. Here is day two. I had managed to get Gordon's face all roughed in. Here is a close up of Gordon's face after smoothing his facial tones with a dry brush. My wife Leigh took the reference photograph that I used to paint from. If you closely at Gordon's right eye, you will clearly see the beautiful orange sunset, trees and sky reflected there. Day three. I have roughed in the base coat for Gordon's bandana and metal star concho. Here is day four. You can see that I have painted in my basecoat for the shirt and vest. Day five. I laid down what are the heavy shadow areas of the shirt and…
OK children, gather around, it's time for a history lesson! As you look out our front window here on the Lower South Fork of the Shoshone River, which faces southwest, you see the famous landmark, called Castle Rock about three miles away. It juts up from the valley floor and stands all by itself. It rises several hundred above the floor of the valley. Castle Rock actually climbs to 6,010 feet above sea level. Here at the ranch we are about 5300 feet above sea level to give you an idea how high it is.

J. Gordon Edwards (June 24, 1867 – December 31, 1925) was a Canadian film director, producer, and writer who began his career as a stage actor and stage director.
Edwards went on helming all of the Fox Film Corporation's mega-budget spectacles, including all of actress Theda Bara's productions between 1916 and 1919. Later, he became the production supervisor at Fox, and continued to direct until he died in 1925. One of his biggest projects was The Queen of Sheba (1921), a lost silent film which contained a huge chariot race, four years before Ben-Hur (1925). He was the stepgrandfather of director Blake Edwards.
J. Gordon Edwards died of pneumonia at age 58 in New York City and was interred at Kensico Cemetery in a grandiose private mausoleum with a minaret on each side similar to the Taj Mahal.
