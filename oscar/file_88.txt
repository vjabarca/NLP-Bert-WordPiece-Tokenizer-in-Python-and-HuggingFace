Roy Choi recently hinted at opening up a new hotel concept as his next project, during an interview with Esquire
If Roy Choi can start the street food revolution single-handedly, we wonder what he could do for the hotel industry.
Roy Choi has a lot on his plate recently. After announcing last month that he and Daniel Patterson are working on a revolutionary fast food concept, he hinted this week that he may be going into the hotel business. In an interview with Jean Pigozzi on Esquire’s YouTube show, My Friends Call Me Johnny, Roy Choi said that his next big project could be to open a hotel.
“You know how hotels are separated? If you want luxury you have to go to luxury, if you want value, you go value,” said Choi. “We end up inadvertently separating humanity from each other. Well, I want to blur those lines; I want people to experience the same levels of high and low together. I did it with street food and I can do it with hotels.”
But when asked about the logistics and obstacles of opening up a hotel, or even a chain of hotels, Choi said “I just play dumb. My job in the world is giving out the food.”
This would not be the street food king’s first venture into the hotel industry. Choi opened up Pot inside the Line Hotel in Los Angeles early this spring.

This vacant IBF Inter-Continental middleweight clash represents a big step up in class for Ulster native Cummings, who is managed by Hall of Famer Barry McGuigan and trained by ‘2016 BBBofC Trainer of the Year’ Shane McGuigan. ‘Dynamite’ has boxed all over the world as both an amateur and a professional but will now take on his most experienced opponent to date when he squares off against twenty-eight year old German middleweight contender Ronny Mittag on November 18.
Germany’s Mittag has been a pro for over nine years and although he is only three years older than Cummings, he brings a lot more experience to the table than his undefeated opponent. The former IBO International middleweight champion is an inch taller than Cummings and has completed over a hundred and twenty more rounds as a professional, meaning Coalisland’s Cummings will have to be at his very best on November 18 if he is to walk away with the IBF Inter-Continental belt.
“This is a fantastic opportunity for me to showcase my skills in front of a large television audience on Spike and to pick up my first belt as a professional,” said Cummings. “It’s great to be on a big show at the SSE Arena, Wembley where so many historic fights have taken place over the years.”
“I want to win that IBF Inter-Continental belt, it’s the same belt that my stablemate Carl Frampton won on his way up and I want to emulate Carl by winning the title in style on November 18. My opponent is a genuine contender but nothing is going to stop me getting the win on November 18.”
Germany’s Mittag is equally confident that he can cause an upset and win the vacant title on November 18. “I am travelling to London to win that belt,” said Mittag. “He (Cummings) is a good fighter, he looks strong but I have fought and beaten strong fighters in the past. My experience will tell on November 18 and I will be taking that belt home to Germany.”
Cummings’ manager, former WBA world featherweight champion Barry McGuigan is excited about his charge’s latest challenge. “Conrad Cummings is in a really good fight on November 18 at the SSE Arena, Wembley,” said McGuigan. “He has made big improvements in the past year and has been learning all the time in the gym, now Conrad must put that all together when squares off against Ronny Mittag on the undercard of Groves vs Gutknecht. I know that he can win this fight and win it in style but he will have to be at his very best to beat a seasoned pro like Mittag, it looks set to be a great contest!”
Cummings vs Mittag forms part of an action packed undercard to George Groves’ terrestrial television debut live on Channel 5 at the SSE Arena, Wembley on Friday November 18. Also appearing on the bill is undefeated British flyweight champion Andrew Selby, Peckham’s English welterweight champ Johnny Garton, Hammersmith’s Dan Dan Keenan and Ruislip’s Dean Richardson.
Tickets for this fantastic night of championship boxing on Friday November 18 at the SSE Arena, Wembley are on sale now from AXS.COM andSSEARENA.CO.UK and priced £40, £60 and £100 + handling fees.

The 21 year old former English schoolboy finalist possesses fire in his fists and, after a successful amateur career, he is set to be unleashed into the paid code on promoter Frank Warren’s huge show at Liverpool’s Echo Arena on October 25th.

Recently boxing writer Glynn Evans interviewed the Anthony Farnell trained starlet to gather some background information.
Family background: I live with my mum in Ellesmere Port and I’ve one younger brother called Casey who’s only six but has already started going the gym. No children of my own yet.
Nickname: ‘Nutty’! It’s short for ‘Gingernut’. ‘Macca’ (Peter Phelan), my old amateur trainer gave it to me when I was six and it’s stuck ever since.
What age did you become interested in boxing and why? An uncle used to go the boxing gym, just for fitness. I was a bit of a wild child, full of beans, so my mum decided to take me to the gym to instil a bit of discipline. Instantly, I enjoyed everything about it.
What do you recall of your amateur career? I couldn’t have my first amateur bout until I was 11. I went straight in the schoolboy championships and lost!
I only ever boxed for the Vauxhall Motors ABC, in Ellesmere Port. I was coached from six until 21 by Peter Phelan and grew up alongside little Paul Butler (ex IBF bantam champion), Nick McDonald (three time senior English ABA champion) and Matty Fagan.
I had about 57 amateur bouts and I think I lost 11. I got to the national schoolboys final when I was about 12 but lost to a Liverpool lad called Connor O’Brien from the Gemini club. I also got to a CYP national semi but was always the ‘nearly kid’, losing at the quarters or semis.
I beat loads of good lads who are pros now like Callum Cook, who’s with the Hattons, Marcus Morrison, who’s with Joe Gallagher and Kofi Yates who’s now my stable mate at ‘Arnie (Anthony Farnell)’s gym. I also lost against a lad called Callum Winton, who represented England at the World Juniors and is now pro with Bob Shannon.
However, whilst I was tough and could punch, I never really had an amateur style – I like to hurt people (!) – so never got picked for the GB Development Squads and never boxed international. Kids I beat like Adam Davies – a tall southpaw with a good international style – got picked ahead of me. I did box for the north-west area squads though and also had a couple of great trips to Germany and Spain with my club, boxing at huge arenas.
Unfortunately, I picked up a bad shoulder injury the night I beat Kofi. That put me out for almost two years and consequently I had a very short senior career. I only entered the senior ABAs once, losing at Area level. I entered at 64 kilos which was a big mistake as I’m nearly six foot tall. At the time, my body fat was less than 4% and I felt really ill. That was the only loss in seven bouts, after I came back from my (shoulder) operation.
Still, no regrets. I never thought of giving up or became disheartened if I had a setback. I just went back to the gym and worked harder.
Why did you decide to turn pro when you did? Since Paul Butler started training over at ‘Arnie’s gym, I’d tag along with him. I’d be holding my own in open spars with the likes of Dean Byrne and Matty Hall, top quality pros. I inquired if ‘Arnie’ would consider training me if I decided to go pro and he said he’d love to. He and Paul Butler sorted things out with the Warrens and, after I lost in the senior ABAs, it all snowballed from there.
Tell us about your back up team: I’m managed by (Queensberry matchmaker) Jason McClory, promoted by Frank Warren and trained by Anthony Farnell at his gym in Failsworth, Manchester.
There’s plenty of quality pros there to learn from such as Butler, Matty Hall, Matty Fagan, Macauley McGowan…..Guys like Dean Byrne and John Murray also pop in.
‘Arnie’ has such a good boxing brain and is a mastermind on the pads, always developing new combinations. But he’s also one of the lads and makes training a laugh….until he sees you slacking! He doesn’t rollock ya, he just ignores you. We’re so keen for his time that we go out of our way to work hard and impress him.
I sort my nutrition out myself. I’m pretty clued up on that side and I also attend a few strength and conditioning or ply metric classes every week at Total Fitness in Chester.
What’s your training schedule? Which parts do you most and least enjoy? I train at Arnie’s gym every morning, Monday to Friday. Regarding running, I mostly do sprints for fitness unless I need to drop weight. I also do strength and conditioning classes two evenings a week. I’ll do one big run on either Saturday or Sunday, then rest the other day.
At ‘Arnie’s’, I train with Paul Butler and Matty Fagan as we all travel up together from Ellesmere Port. We’ll warm up with some skipping and shadow boxing, then split into three stations. One will run up and down the stairs leading to the gym, one will do the bar-bag, the other will do pads with Arnie inside the ring. After four or five rounds at each station, we’ll rotate.
All told we usually do 12-18 rounds. After that, we’ll do a stomach workout together, then stretch off. We all want to achieve big things in the boxing so we give it our all, every day.
On sparring days, I usually work with Kofi Yates and Matty Hall. That’s my favourite part of training as it most resembles the actual fight. I really enjoy the adrenalin
, even getting hit. It’s the feisty redhead in me! Worst part is the bar-bag. It’s very good for your fitness but not fun at all.
Describe your style? What are your best qualities? I’m an action man. I’m probably a stronger boxer than I am a fighter but I’ll not run from a good tear-up. Now, I need to box their ears off and if the big shot comes, it comes.
I’ve got a good, hard, straight jab and pretty good head movement. I stopped a few in the amateurs. They tended to wince from every shot I landed, a bit like my idol Canelo Alvarez.
What specifically do you need to work on to fully optimise your potential as a fighter? Lots. I need to relax more and vary the power. Touch, touch, then bang a big one in rather than putting full steam into every shot I throw. I need to learn when to apply pressure and when to sit back. Basically, I need to develop my general ring craft.
What have you found to be the biggest difference between the pro and amateur codes? As an amateur, I was usually far stronger than my opponent. In the pros, they’re all really strong so you have to box the ears off them first to create openings before going in and hurting them. These journeymen are all used to absorbing punishment. Hard, hard men.
Who is the best opponent that you’ve shared a ring with? Probably Callum Winton from Hartlepool who beat me in the junior ABAs. He was sharp and very mature for his age. He was the only one who, at the time, I felt I’d not have been able to have beaten that day, even if I was at my best.
As a younger lad, I did a lot of sparring with little Paul (Butler) but, weight wise, we grew apart. He could always really punch for his size and had class combinations.
All time favourite fighter: Canelo Alvarez. Another fiery red head! He’s not great yet -still fresh and coming through – but I think he will be.
All time favourite fight: Andre Berto against Victor Ortiz for the WBC welterweight title. Real ‘up and down’ edge of the seat stuff.
What is your routine on fight day? I’m an early bird, every day. After waking, I’ll chill out and listen to music. If my weight’s good and I’m okay to have breakfast, I’ll have a little bowl of porridge with some nuts, or yoghurt and fruit.
I wake up ‘psyched’! Throughout the day, I’ll be constantly thinking about the fight and the opponent but I’m never really nervous. It’s more excitement. I’m always confident in myself.
I might visit family or mates. At the venue, I like to step inside the ring to get a feel of the canvas and ropes – they do differ – before heading to the changing rooms. I stay pretty relaxed. Then it’s time to trade some leather! After my fights, I’ve usually won so, though I never drink, I’ll go for a night out with the lads and down a couple of Red Bulls.
How do you relax? I enjoy a game of golf. I play off a nine handicap. Butler plays off six. I used to play football also. Me and little Paul played up front together until I snapped my ankle about a year and a half ago. I’ve not played since.
Films/TV: Ideally, I like action or scary films but, having a little six year old brother, I also love all the animation films. My favourite films are When We Were Kings, When We Were Soldiers, and all the Rocky films. On TV, I mainly watch documentaries.
Aspiration in life: To give 110% at everything I do and have no regrets. Whatever I attempt, I like to leave it all on the line.

I’m happy to announce that I’ve decided to post the Folaji Story on the site as a Prologue to the Rise of the X-Syndicate story.
The Folaji Story was the first story I wrote and published online back in 2006, before this site even existed. It served as a character background for many of my World of Warcraft characters and also as a springboard for my venture into online writing.
I’ll admit I considered going all George Lucas on the story. After all, it’s been six years since I wrote it, and there are some passages that just stand out as though needing a rewrite. I decided it best, however, to keep the story original in its entirety. Sure its not perfect, but it’s my first (online) published story, and will therefore always have a special place in my heart, regardless of how badly it’s written.
The story consists of five parts, and will be published over the next couple of days (i.e. one part per day). You can find all published parts by going to the Rise of the X-Syndicate page.

i've graduated. i've found a job that i have a great passion for, luckily enough on the first try. i've had my heart broken and bruised a few times. i've felt my soul get crushed when we lost dad, but i've also seen just how great a guy he was. i've taken a plunge onto that important safety net called friendship and subsequently done my own bit in that area (if small). i've taken on responsibilities that i have never really imagined myself taking. most importantly, i've fallen in love.
and it is thanks to that love that i'm writing here once again. after all, she brings out the utmost best in me - so much so that the people around me can sense the joy and mirth that i now have in my life.
yet, here it is - so tangible that i feel it constantly on a day-to-day basis when it previously seemed so distant, so right that mere months feel like years compressed into minutes in terms of richness, yet it feels so brief and fleeting even when we're together all the time...
and to make things even worse, i have to be up in 4.5 hours to play ball (assuming it doesn't rain...)... d'oh.
already one bird seems to have woken up to start its day and is announcing that fact to the world... here i am trying to get some sleep as the other early birds in the time zone are more than half way through their slumber, just on the precipice of re-entering the waking world that i am so desperately trying to extricate myself from.
that's one more thing to tack onto my to-do list before getting a job: resetting my bloody bio clock...
guess it's back to another round of tossing and turning and trying to find the escape hatch that leads to dreamland...
once again, it's been a long, long pause between ramblings. didn't have quite that much to write about and talking about my third round of hand, foot and mouth disease (courtesy of the niece and nephew) wouldn't have made for fun reading.
needless to say, my somewhat lifeless (for the moment anyway) existence continues to bounce along. i really should be getting off my lazy ass and getting around to drafting my resume and start job hunting. i really, really should. but the thought of drafting a resume and then the subsequent interviews and waiting and... aye carumba.
i guess i really should stop dragging my feet though. but enough about my state of joblessness, i am here to discuss halloween costume ideas!
well more like ideas that i would like to pull off. if i ever go for a halloween party that is... like that'll ever happen to lifeless me. but nevertheless, it's fun to imagine...
after all this time of watching bleach, i only realise that the one supporting character i find really cool is a dead guy. guess that's somewhat appropriate since it's a series about spirits and death... but hell, kaien is pretty cool for a dead guy. physically he looks just like ichigo with black hair. and i could definitely pull the spikey hair off. finding a katana and a kimono to match might be a bit of a problem tho...
get a cane, walk with a limp, dress up like a slacker and spout sarcasm and caustic wit with every line of speech. especially good idea with my house t-shirt that has a silhouette of house that says "THE DOCTOR IS IN". will probably have to let my facial hair grow for a few years and put powder in my hair to grey it a little though.
hoho. dressing up as fergie complete with purple nose and spouting angry rubbish in a thick scottish accent would be fun. or growing a norse beard like rafa benitez proclaiming a list of facts and other rubbish like lucas is an actual footballer. or being like arsene wenger and kicking a bottle and claiming not to see things that are going on. heck, for kicks, dressing up like jose and claiming to be the special one and being all smug and charismatically charming at the same time... though speaking in accents all evening sure won't be fun... especially if people are asking for the hairdryer treatment AND THEY KENNA UHNDERSTAND YER!
now this would be a helluva lot of fun. sure, it would probably be a heckuva cliche to get a cloak with a hood, a scythe and glowing red eyes. but the possiblities... how about a black hoodie with black jeans and black shoes with bitchin' half gloves and a scythe? death's modernising, yo. though sadly the church wouldn't really approve as they're saying people are getting all drawn into an unhealthy fascination of the occult and death and crap because of halloween... sometimes mother church could really do with some lightening up...
probably one of the scariest looking shinigamis from bleach, kenpachi is just insanely bloodthirsty and always looking for a fight. and he's a mishmash of elements from a tonne of halloween types! a samurai in a black kimono like a japanese grim reaper and an eyepatch for a dash of pirate. those spikes are gonna be hard as hell to style tho, as are those little bells he puts on the tips to give his opponents a chance in combat because he's that insanely good...
i know i started my post meant for last sunday, but in the end, i just never got down to finishing it.
in short, it was a great sunday, especially since i finally had my long awaited opportunity to play basketball at tanglin cc, the group's old stamping ground till we decided to shift to the moe cca branch (or old nie as we still call it).
well, kind of like how i had two crappy sundays in a row, i have had two fantastic sundays back to back, and i daresay this sunday was better than last.
yep, i probably had a better game of ball last sunday and much better weather, but today had its own awesome fun moments even though i'm all lobster red again. there is a certain enjoyment in my game again that has been missing that just makes the charring to a crustaceany finish all worth it along with the nice feeling of having put in a good shift.
after lunch and lan, i went for mass at the cathedral (not so great considering it's been ages since my last visit to a church without aircon), and i bumped into ms ong at the bus stop after that. we caught up a bit before her bus came. it was a pleasant surprise and really nice to see her as she's one of the best teachers i've ever had.
next up was that bloody incredible manchester derby we watched at dod's place. great goals, stupid mistakes, drama and controversy; this game had it all. and of course, united came out on top. not the scoreline that reflects the spanking of those upstart mercenaries as i had hoped for, but snatching victory right at the death in stoppage time pretty much makes up for it. watching those city bastards all forlorn and all as well as that ass mark hughes throwing hissy fits because of the time added on just made all the heartstopping drama worth it.
as an aside, sorry if you expected a good reception from the fans, carlos tevez you bloody judas. you may have been a good servant for us, but leaving for city rivals automatically bumps your rep down a notch. sure, the fans may have loved you, and you may have tried sucking up to us by saying good things about us. but we're bloody not stupid when you diss the team that made you a champion of both england and europe. i thoroughly enjoyed deriding and booing your sorry, mercenary ass everytime you touched the ball and absolutely enjoyed seeing you prancing around the pitch like a clueless, forlorn little deer. have fun chasing shadows or qualification for europe with that bunch of money-grubbing losers.
after all that drama, we went our seperate ways after the guys got some dao hui from geylang (i got me some 7up since i'm not a soya person...) and, as fate would have it, i met another person i hadn't seen in a long while in the form of goose at eunos mrt station.
hopefully next sunday's just as bloody good as this one or even better... but that's really gonna take something special.
without it, we are like leaves in a rushing river of life, at the mercy of every flow and every ebb.
once we find it, however, it is like latching on to a rope attached to the strongest tree in the jungle alongside the river. we can then haul ourselves out and proceed along any path we want.
but now that i've found the motivation to improve both my stamina and my basketball skills, i really, really feel committed to sticking to my plan.
and while it gets boring and, well, naturally tiring at times, i'm actually enjoying it. sweating it out once a day on the basketball court feels good.
i'm reading myself into a fanatical basketball fervour thanks to slam dunk, but thanks to the rain on sunday morning, i have gone a month without a proper game.
i know i shot some hoops downstairs on sunday afternoon after coming back from the failed trip to bukit timah, but it's still nothing like a real game. no one to pressure you, no one to dribble pass, no one to defend against... urgh.
• noun (pl. soliloquies) an act of speaking one’s thoughts aloud when alone or regardless of hearers, especially in a play.
many thanks to matt moylan of lilformers for letting me use the chalk grimlock for the banner. thanks matt!
Well folks, it was a hot one at The Big What? this year. With temperatures soaring up into the 90s every day of the weekend, it could have easily been a recipe for a miserable time and an excuse for widespread crankiness. However, that was NOT the case for this, the 5th year of Big Something’s cherished annual music festival.
Good vibes, smiles, and positive energy abound, even during the oppressive heat of the day, nothing seemed to be able to stifle the labor of love that Big Something and company had created for their fans. It was hard to find anyone with anything negative to say, which served as a constant a testament to the devotion of fans in attendance, the professional attention to detail put forth by the band and crew, and countless special little touches which allowed for a weekend of smoothly running epic fun.
There were certainly those who avoided the scorching planes and sought shelter in the cooler shade of the wooded camping area during the day, but once the sun and temperature had dropped the party was in full effect. All of the music of the weekend was top notch, and sit-ins were a regularity. Darby did great keeping up the energy as MC, Al Al kept things sweet and nasty as artist at large, Zach Deputy laid down the law at a secret late-night camp stage, and the Big Something boys had lots of memorable guest appearances.
The thing that really stood out in a sea of hazy memorable moments was Friday’s amazing secret Big Something set, which took place at a fully functional hidden stage a short parade procession away, and gave the festival an intimate uniqueness and reflected the thoughtfulness and genuine spirit of a band who truly appreciates their fans.

Cracking day out yesterday, fans were in fine voice I dont have a clue to the lyrics of ole ole ole song (someone please tell me!!). Made Burton look a very poor side for most of the game and then switched off. Thought Burton may have got a draw but we held out and took the 3 points. This group of players seem so much closer together this season long may it continue.
Oh BTW that was my car over the tannoy blocking a works unit!!! Stoooopid car parking steward told me to park there. Nearly missed the kick off because of that!
See you all at Wycombe, bring the drum again I think it makes a cracking difference to the noise level!
It would be good if DrummerAdam or someone who knows the words to the new songs could get them put on the two message boards. I know Nipper is in contact with him and maybe some others too. If he could come on here and provide us with the words it would help us all!

No place for Ritchie de Laet? According to the official Premier League website: “For the 2010/11 campaign Under 21 players will have been born on or after 1st January 1989.” De Laet’s birthday is November 1988. However, on the official site he is listed as a U-21 with the club today confirming that every player not out loan is eligible to play. Weird.
[edit] The squad list on the Premier League’s website includes De Laet in he named squad. I imagine the official United website will follow suit.
Scott is the editor of Made In Manchester. He writes for ESPN, Four Four Two and Red News. He started The Republik of Mancunia in March 2006. Follow @R_o_M on Twitter.
(That PL list annoyingly includes U21 players who are out on loan, does this mean we could opt to recall Cleverley or Welbeck at any point and they'd be eligible?).
There's nothing in the lists denoting who is a keeper, can anyone point me to where the 3 keeper rule is mentioned as I can't find it? (Am I just being a dumbass here?)
Journos keep saying about Chelsea's squad, but I am only seeing 19 senior players. Apparently you can name less than 8 homegrown players if your squad tally is less than 25.
Apparently if you don't have 8 homegrown players, then you can't name a squad of 25. This is the explanation that I found on the premierleague site -
"Similarly, clubs do not have to name eight home grown players if they do not have that many but that would mean operating with a reduced squad."
After the birth of my son - destiny with Costas my dear friend beckons is the thing I'm looking forward to the most
One thing that needs to be pointed out, and i hope for the last time; Ben Amos is registered in the main list because we have to register 3 GKs. No matter how old they are, we have to comply to the rules that says we have to register 3 (THREE) names for the GK. I hope people can understand that so no more "he's under 21 he doesnt need to be registered"
and the other only glaring comment i noticed is from ericthedog.. SAF doesnt have a "pretty good track record" instead SAF has "THE BEST" track record in the world. =)
"No matter how old they are, we have to comply to the rules that says we have to register 3 (THREE) names for the GK."
And that second page, which I am assuming is the official list submitted to the Premier League, lists Amos amongst the U21s, not in the main squad of 25.
I don't think there is any rule to suggest that we couldn't (for example) start with O'Shea in goal, or bring on Kuszczak as a striker. I know they had a 3 keeper rule at the World Cup (which North Korea had tried to get around and fell foul of) but I've never seen it mentioned in the Prem. Don't know about Champions' League either way.
I could be wrong here but I've yet to find this rule written down (or mentioned in the press) the only reason to believe it may still be the case is because we've only named 24 players (but I think that's purely because we've only *got* 24 players over 21...???)
wats your problem with van der vart mate???he said he wud join our team if he is guaranteed first team football nad i dun think sir alex really apreciated wat he said !!!! you have to earn the shirt !!!
Uninspiring??? How can a squad that contains Edwin, Rooney, Berba, Nani, Fletcher, Rio, Vidic , Evra, Valencia, Hernandez, Giggs, Scholes, Nev, Ando etc etc be fucking "uninspiring"? I think you are following the wrong team pal. Unbelievable.
Alan - Nani has one good game then ten bad???? No he doesn't thats just made up. He is 22 mate. VDV is 28. Nani at 28 will be on a different planet to VDV. That good only Spurs wanted him.
We did however buy the fastest footballer on the planet who scored more goals than Rooney Messi Kaka Ronaldo at the world cup (and the same combined before everyone starts : )
This team does it all for me - maybe I like some of my fellow fans just know something other's don't
Did anyone notice that some teams have their senior squad submitted without single English player? Arsenal have submitted their 25 man squad (20 exactly) and there's no single English player in the list, also they've submitted the biggest under 21 squad in the EPL. This rule really sucks and will not help the National Team.
Was looking at the Chelsea and Arsenal squad they have named only 4 and 7 home grown players in their squad respectively. This means they will have to compensate it with other players and hence have like 19 and 20 players in their squad. Infact if you take a look at Chelsea with their defensive injuries right now, they may have Ferreira playing CB and Essien RB for their next game. So when people say United's squad looks uninspiring it's kind of silly. We definetly have more cover then our rivals.
I would have loved to add VDV to our squad at 8mill...but I can live without him not being there. What shocks me most is how the value of a player can fall by 10 mill within hours. It's amazing how the mob does business over in Madrid. I for one won't be suprised if VDV has a amazing season and bites then back in the ass like Snijder and Robben. Round of 16 Champions League Tottenham Hotspurs v Real Madrid 4-4. Spurs win on away goals.VDV scoring that important winning away goal at the Bernabeau. Read the headlines " Vaart did you do, Jose?"
@Jemmie - it doesn't. It says Fabregas is homegrown because he was cultivated here - what it's doing is trying to limit clubs like City from signing up all the foreign talent and calling it an English football club. This way, they are 'investing' in the league by buying players that have been raised here and promotes the other clubs raising more players to play and to sell.
Overall a good squad.But the problem is midfield.Frankly i dont have faith in carrick.Hargo is injured ando has to do a nani ,Park is not a world class player he is just a squad player.So we have two left and they are scholes and fletcher(football genius).Scholes cant play every game.I just hope injuries dont hit us this season.But i won t be surprised if carrick is sold in january and we buy lass or annan or even rodwell.
just loooked at the chelsea 25 and they only seem to have FOUR homegrown players but i thought the rule was they were meant to have at least EIGHT
They can name less than 8 homegrown, as long as they name less than 25 seniors. They had no problem trimming the fat since they only named 19 seniors!
I think our midfield is sorted, I don't know what all the whining's about? Shoulda bought Ozil.. Shoulda bough VDV.. OZIL DIDN'T WANT TO FUCKING JOIN UTD SO FUCK HIM, LET HIM PLAY FOR THE VIRUS. VDV would only be a replacement for when Scholesy needs a rest so wouldn't play many games and he'd most likely upset the dressing room, not to mention his sky high wages. FFS look at our midfield.. it's stacked with talent! We've got players that can play in multiple positions so stop worrying! Sit back and enjoy our great club play some fantastic football instead of whining and whinging all the bloody time.

I had every intention coming up to Christmas to keep coding right through it. Travelling back up north, I only had a surface with me – with no desk or anything suitable at my parent’s home to make it comfortable.
Once I got there, I decided to actually have a break. A few days with no code. In fact, I tried my hardest not to use my surface at all – bar weather models and some sale shopping, I stayed away.
It did me some good. I felt a renewed vigour and focus when I sat down at 9am the morning after I got back to London to get cracking on finishing the PHP with MySQL Essential Training course on Lynda.
Some of the course went over the basics that I already knew, which was fine for a reminder and I picked up one or two tips. Where the most learning was achieved was from the chapters on working with MySQL – I know SQL reasonably well in terms of structuring data requests, SELECT, INPUT, DELETE yadda yadda, but what I had no idea of was how to actually use it, and also how to structure it within PHP.
The course took me through building my own Content Management System, the four basic functions of data storage – CRUD, and login systems, including theories around hashing passwords.
I still have some questions though, especially with regards as how to best structure tables within databases, so I shall be looking to expand my knowledge further. The next course I’m planning on starting tomorrow morning, at no later than 9am, is PHP with MySQL Beyond the Basics – pretty much the follow-up, by the same author – only 10 and a half hours of video this time, which could easily turn to double once I have re-coded it all myself and convinced myself that I have enough of an understanding to move on.
No later than 9am as I have a new structure. I was studying much of the day anyway but getting distracted a bit too much. I have set myself a 9am to 6pm workday, working in chunks of 45 minutes followed with a 15 minute break, until 4pm at which point I’m working in 30 minute chunks followed by a 15 minute break. I shall also be allowing myself every Sunday off – to recharge and do whatever the heck I want. Within the bounds of my strict unemployed budget, of course.
Hopefully I won’t be unemployed for too much longer. I am doing what I can in terms of applying for every role that looks like I am suited for, and that looks at least vaguely interesting. I’ve had four telephone interviews over the last week – one I know I won’t get, perhaps two, but one has led to an interview this Friday. A very interesting role and very interesting company (of course I would say that just in case they are reading!).
Importantly, I also have an interview tomorrow for the job that I did the coding challenge for. I was really happy with what I did, albeit knowing there were one or two areas that I didn’t have the time to put into it, and it seems my interviewer was impressed too.
I’ve had a good feeling about this one right from when I sent the application, for some reason. Of course, I may be up against more suitable or more experienced candidates – who knows. My Dad told me not to get my hopes up but balls to that – I have my hopes up. I may be a realist but I’m generally an optimist too.
And there are other jobs that I have applied for directly (ie not through those blinking job sites…I could do a whole post just on my frustrations with those) that I think I have a good chance of hearing back from. Lots going on.
I have always believed that I am a very employable junior web developer, more so by the day, and if I don’t do myself justice in the upcoming interviews I shall be disappointed. If I do well, it is certainly feasible, without wanting to be too arrogant, that I could be offered one of these roles. The most important goal is to represent my abilities.
Time to get back on with things – having fun breaking a website that I am making. All for good reason, just a fun little project. It isn’t shit enough yet but it will be by the end of the week (apologies for the swearing dear future potential employer, I am affably polite to face, I occasionally swear in writing). Must sort out those link colours on this blog too.

The project was divided into two parts, one space for cooking, which was designed according to the needs of the employer, and one space for ordering food and customer waiting that we were allowed to design this section.
This space was about eight square meters. To design this small space, the most important issue was the readability and harmony of all the elements forming the space. In this way, the floor, wall and ceiling in the design were considered as an integrated volume covered with wooden logs, which, by creating perspective, caused the dynamics in the interior space.
The common wall between the kitchen space and the food ordering space was colored yellow, so it could distinguish itself from the space.
Finally, the project's facade was also covered with a detail of wood to distinguish the project from its surroundings. Eventually, we came to a design that despite the limitation in the area it had features that captivate the user to itself.

Ever since i was a kid, I have enjoyed listening to all kinds of music. It is an understatement that it can affect one's mood, rhythm, and their level of anxiety, excitement, or calm. One of the ways music affects us in a big way (not talked about yet) is through "association", and consciously or subconsciously involves what songs or styles of music you have heard all your life when you were going thru something, having certain feelings, or in a certain mood. This also involves "remembrance", where we are actively aware of the association, ...like a song that reminds you of a period in time in your past, in a situation, or a specific person, and the feelings you had then (and in turn) have now. ....now let's take this up a notch!
I believe music is very powerful. Some would say "spiritual". I would use that term too, but I prefer to think of it as just powerful, ....in that it directly affects the mind and brain function. Why is it so powerful? Aside from basic association and remembrance, Music's greatest achievement is that it has the ability to take someone and transport them (in thought, or even deeper) to another place and/or another time, .....and that can also be fictional or fantasy. I have closed my eyes and experienced this countless times until it was "more" than just thought or feeling, more like a dream. Certain music is actually composed, written, and extremely well produced just for this very purpose, for the sole purpose of doing this.
That's why movies, commercials, radio, etc. all utilize background music in some form or other, because they already know about the power of music.
I believe the music plays a big part in your state of mind. ....and this is why I like to listen to certain music at low level along with the i-doser dose. I like to use the MP3 mix feature on i-doser pc premium to do this.
Can someone please explain this bit: Electrons are positively charged... I was under the impression that electrons carry a negative charge. Does something change when a great force is issued on them?
Hnn... I think I get it. So, they only have charges when the opposite force is acted upon them and they react?

I thought this was a good article. It talks about partners but should apply to anyone interacting with an ADHDer.
Do not make statements which are demeaning with the hope that it will spark his or her attention that they must make corrective efforts.
Do not say things like: “This is the right way to do this or that.” Or “That’s not the way things should be done.”
Do not take his or her hyper focusing on projects or people, places or things personally. Hyper focusing is not about your relationship directly or indirectly, it’s a difficult to control or much less, predict, trait of ADHD.
Do not insist that medication is the answer to your relationship issues as a whole. Treatment of ADHD will help, but there are at least two people in every relationship, not one.
Do not expect ADHD symptoms to ever completely go away or that you can change someone’s behavior. ADHD symptoms are not bad habits.
Do not expect your ADHD partner to say the right things or become interested in subjects being discussed in social gatherings; however, Adult ADDers have spent a life time trying to fit in and often mix into the background without attracting attention.
Do not predict what we may do or say in every situation – we are rather impulsive and tend to change as things change around us (more on this in an upcoming post).
Do learn all that you can about ADHD. I sincerely think it is best to learn from those who have ADHD, by reading their personal experiences, successes and also their failures. The very best book on the subject from this perspective is Dr. Hallowell’s book ‘Driven to Distraction’. There are many books out there and online blogs written by people with ADHD, each with their own unique perspective. The best book by someone without ADHD is by Gina Pera, ‘Is it You, Me, or Adult A.D.D.’ She interviews thousands of ADDers in relationships (and out) and yes, consoles us too. Her book is specifically about Adult ADHD and Relationship issues, how it effects relationships and what steps can be taken to improve the relationship from the ADHD perspective and treatment options.
Do keep an open mind and realize that you have traveled into a novel experience which you cannot predict or always plan for.
Do express your wants, needs and desires by asking specifically for a time and place to discuss and write them down. Keep it pleasant and be sure to explain how your ADHD partner will benefit by taking your needs into account. I know it is difficult to understand why you or anyone would need to clarify such seemingly obvious things, but it helps to understand that communication cues are often missed by ADHD partners without us meaning to miss them, or (oh my, sorry) ignore you. ADDers also perform better from a reward standpoint and yes, even for you.
Do expect to find things in strange places. We tend to lose things quite frequently, to include, but not limited to: keys, wallets, letters, cards, utensils, cars and yes, even shoes. I take my shoes off just about anywhere in the house. I tried taking them off at the door for at least two days straight and then without considering it, I gave up on that. Each morning I search for my shoes. Joan usually knows where they are, especially if she tripped over them… hi Joan!
Do suggest eating out. Even if you cook, most of us loath nothing more than dishes, so if you like to be helped with the dishes, plan for eating out. Unless, of course, you don’t mind doing the dishes, or letting them sit for days on end. Do invest in plastic, throw away utensils and plates.
Do expect changes to just about everything. We rarely do anything the same way twice and a lot of us love to rearrange things in our homes. If you’re in a new relationship and your ADHD friend always seems to be rearranging their apartment furniture or decoration, roll with it, again, this is not a bad habit, it’s a way of life.
Do expect delays. When we say about 10ish…. We really mean you should probably give us a call around 9ish to remind us or nudge us along, gently, politely… think rewarding thoughts that you might like to express when you call.
Do expect a lot of innovation and creativity. We often come up with new and usually confusing ways of doing things; some can save money, but often cost more money in the long run. I remember purchasing a $2000.00 billiard cue (I had to save quite a while for it). I purchased it for the type of ‘hit’ it gives and performance, not for the art design, so I stripped down the butt end and painted my own design and lacquered it. Yes, that does seem odd, but again, I didn’t buy it for the art design or the mother of pearl, which I destroyed when stripping it… oops. The mother of pearl meant nothing to me, but….. Oh man!
Do expect (and I know this isn’t fair) for us to maneuver ourselves out of house chores and somehow leave them for you. This isn’t intentional, I swear it isn’t, it just happens. I personally do not recommend a home with a garden or front yard, it is just not a good idea, trust me on this one. Goats that eat the grass in the backyard? Now we are talking!
Do expect our lists of do’s to be rather outlandish, but on the other hand, totally serious! Do expect the unexpected.
ADD Forums - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Support and Information Resources Community - View Single Post - (long rant)...Think my dad's dead to me. :(
May there be some spark of willful/mindful/helpful/nurturing momentum/madness among the sorrowful s*** show being currently dealt/felt.
You know...something deep down inside of me can't help but think that in the long run this all very well may be something good for me in the end.
I'll be forced to grow up a bit. I can't rely on my mom and dad anymore. I'll just have to be more careful.
It might even eventually break me out of my nest I've built myself and have me exploring for employment opportunities again. Not right now. Certainly something to be open to though.
This sucks...I want my dad back...but I think after this shock, after some time...I'll find that maybe I'm not losing my dad so much as I'm being freed.
I do love him. Please don't get me wrong. I think I've given him more consistent and forgiving love then anyone but his mom in his life.
Fuzz-Fuzz had some great advice to me the other day that I've been thinking about a lot. I really liked it.
Don't think about it. The big picture stuff. The future and all the overwhelming stuff that I'm losing with the loss of my dad.
Just make it through now. I just need to get through a day at a time right. Focus on the here and the immediate. Make sure I'm fed for the day and have a roof over my head.
I'm glad I got to come vent about this here on addf finally. lol it's been scary being without this place over this last week!

The number of times have I created on my blog site concerning my passion for cooking (and eating)?-- Many, I make sure. I undoubtedly (much like everybody else) have days when I would certainly choose to be served food as opposed to prepare it myself. However after each break from cooking, I look forward to getting back to my kitchen. And after that, it doesn't matter if I am mosting likely to make a popular and many-times examined dish, try out brand-new ingredients or recreate a meal I consumed someplace. I just like it as well as can't envision my life without it.
My enthusiasm for food preparation includes reading dishes, also. When I read it, I try to imagine the preference of the food prepared as per the guidelines. And also if I like it, eventually I will test it out. This enthusiasm makes me acquire more cookery publications (even though I already have many of them). It likewise makes me search for even more fantastic food blogs and also recipes on the net. In addition to search for recipes anywhere: in all kind of publications and even supermarkets' marketing product.
The dish for cauliflower soup with pear as well news as Gorgonzola I discovered in a Waitrose booklet. Immediately I suched as "the photo of the taste" in my mind. As well as soon I was confirmed right. When I prepared the slightly transformed version of the cheesy cauliflower soup for the very first time, I did appreciate it a great deal.
Please do not fret that the light taste of the cauliflower will not make this soup sufficiently attractive. The enhancement of pears and, especially, Gorgonzola cheese, sharpens the flavour of the soup and brings it to a greater level. And also it is not only my point of view. When I checked this Cauliflower Soup on one of my good friends, she liked it so much that she took the leftovers back home with her.
Steve Israel: I've found more than thrills on my blueberry hill - News - recordonline.com - Middletown, NY
This was after one of those terrible end-of-winter storms, when heavy wet snow and brutal winds knocked down trees and power lines all over the place. After I trudged up a hill through snow strewn with bent and broken birch and pine trees, I saw the blueberry bush — the one that was always jam-packed with the sweetest, darkest berries — smashed almost as flat as, well, a blueberry pancake. The branches that once rose about six feet tall and just as wide were pinned down in the snow by at least a foot of the white stuff.
Try as I might to loosen them from the snow's icy grip, the branches wouldn’t budge — unless I broke them, which I wouldn’t do. The few I did manage to loosen did not spring up.
It was in the center of what my wife and I named blueberry hill when we moved to our home in Bethel some 17 years ago. Not only did it yield the best, tastiest berries, it sat atop a hill where we would sit, picnic and enjoy a view that stretched for miles.
I learned that even if it seems like you’ve picked all of the berries from the bush, you shouldn’t despair. If it looks like you've exhausted the berries after circling the bush in one direction, you should just stop and move around it in the other direction. With a new perspective, you’ll find berries hidden under leaves that you’ve missed on the first go round. The moral is, of course, that you shouldn’t close yourself off to other views and see life through blinders. Your life will be enriched if you open yourself up to as many perspectives — and people — as possible.
Perhaps it was a sad one: That all things must pass. Or, as the Bible, Pete Seeger and the Byrds say: “To everything there is a season.”
So, as winter eased into spring and the snow finally disappeared, revealing all of the countless trees and bushes that had been battered by the storms, I decided to face reality. I walked up the hill to see the damage to my favorite blueberry bush.
I did a double take when I saw it was still standing. Not only that, all of the branches were intact. And as the weather warmed and leaves began to grow from the branches, delicate pink/white flowers blossomed and green berries began to form.
Then, on a cool morning after last week’s blistering heat, I again walked up to blueberry hill. I couldn’t believe what I saw. The other blueberry bushes still had their green baby berries, but my favorite bush — the one that I thought was a goner — was the only one bursting with blueberries. Not just any berries, but the biggest, bluest, tastiest ones it had ever produced.
We can learn from the adversity of life’s storms and, like that blueberry bush, stand up stronger than ever.
I am living a life of faith and hope while I learn to grow a family together with my best friend/husband.

Coreplay: Last night I had my first opportunity to see a band that has significant importance in my life. I was able to get tickets at the closest balcony table on the right balcony arm so was able to have a perfect view of the concert and the acoustics from where I sat were PERFECT. I spent the first 5 songs on the floor with friends and thought it was a bit overcrowded but the energy in the crowd was fantastic. Surveying this from the balcony was amazing. Seeing this sea of people singing along to most songs and waving their hands. I attempted to take pictures from the balcony but the digital camera I had took very blurry photos. From what I heard disposable cameras were fully allowed inside and I assume this will true for all other shows as I believe it is up to the band more so than the venue.
The band sounded terrific. Most of the performance fell on Chris who is super animated compared to the rest of the band. I was completely impressed with his energy and how great he sounded live.
The most emotional moment in the crowd was during yellow. I think the entire house was singing along and the whole crowd was bathed in yellow light. From the balcony it was amazing to see the crowd and I almost watched the audience more than I watched the band for this one.
My only complaint about the show was its length. It was only 1:35 with the encores. I suppose the important thing is that the show was 100% wonderful while it lasted and it is better to leave an audience wanting more than walking out before its over. Still I REALLY WANTED TO HEAR ARUSH OF BLOOD OR AMSTERDAM! These songs deserve to be played. The audience gave the loudest ovation that I have ever heard after Scientist and I just can't believe the band couldn't have put in another 15 minutes or so as this was the tour opener and the crowd was so excited.
All in all this was one of the best shows I've been to in terms of sound and crowd energy. It was a fantastic time. I made the 6 hour trek to Atlanta last year only to find that the show was cancelled at the last minute and I had missed a 6 song impromtu show in the parking lot. Needless to say I was thrilled to have this opportunity to see the band in a great venue minutes from my home.
Yankgirl (Courtney): YAY for Orlando! I am really proud of Orlando! They crowd was amazing! I was right up front across from Guy & I remember looking up during one of the last songs & it was unreal. Practically everyone in the place was on their feet & singing. I could have cried. It was wonderful. I'm so happy everyone was there for Coldplay, ya know? Everyone had a great time & for the most part everyone was really chill & nice which is always good :-) I am so happy I went. It really was the best concert I have ever been to & I've been to a lot this past year.
I stood there staring at Guy forever ha ha He's just so cool when he plays, not to mention really pretty ha ha ha
Hobbes: I attended the Orlando concert (drove from Tampa and took the day off work ) and it was so worth it. While I, too, was bothered by the short length (I could listen to them forever!), the concert was amazing! Chris's energy is remarkable, and his voice is just as melodic live! I was really enjoying the entire atmosphere. The audience sang along with every song, nailing all the words and showing the band that they were true fans, not just those who listened to the radio hits.
I was really looking forward to them playing AROBTTH and was disappointed when they didn't. However, the entire performance was an experience I won't soon forget. I think it was by far the best concert I've ever attended.
Sandra Jones: I went to the Coldplay concert last night in Orlando, Fl. at the Hard Rock Live...I must say the concert was amazing!! One of the best concerts I have been to in a while. Chris just had so much energy jumping around and he ruled the piano. The atmosphere was great. The crowd was loving every minute! Anyone who has a chance to see them I highly reccomend it!
Blonderoxy: I was front row for the show last night at hard rock live and let me say that it was awesome! I have seen many concerts and Coldplay by far was the best show I have ever been to! They played their asses off! They did not take 10 minutes inbetween songs to tune their instruments. Their encoure was also short. They rocked, and also played a new song that is not yet released entitled "Moses". Chris said it is a song about falling in love and meating someone very beautiful. He played it acoustic saying it was so new they did not have parts for drums/guitars. Anyways, I was really impressed, they rocked and were so nice! If your going to one of their shows you will definately have a blast!
IhopeInever: I was at the show lastnight too. It was completly soldout. It was AWESOME!!!; Ron Sexsmith was ok...but I think everyone just couldn't wait to see Coldplay. I was probably 17 ft from the stage. Chris would throw his water into the crowd and Jon played a hurmonica (I think that's how u spell it) then threw it into the crowd also...I almost caught it!!! Anyways...It was a great show...the best I had ever seen!!!
Velvet Morning: The Orlando concert was amazing!!! I was in the front row in front of john. The crowd was amazing and I met some really cool fans in the line. I didn't think that after the concert the night could get any better, but as I was walking back to my hotel, who do I see in a hidden corner??!! Chris and the band!! I got their autographs and got to hang with them for 5 minutes while the band loaded up their suitcases on to the bus!! I have to say that they are awsome, they are so down to earth!!! Chris told me and my friends that he hoped that they put on a good show for us. John was also incredible, I got to talk to him a little bit about his guitar gear, awsome guy!!!
Justrideit: Absolutely amazing! Couldn't have asked for a better concert! The energy, the crowd, the lights, the setlist, etc was incredible. They were really appreciative of the crowd. The crowd was singing along to every word and screaming non-stop. The lights were out of this world, which attributed to the great atmosphere, with mostly red, green, and blue lights. Chris was very into it. He dedicated a song to justin timberlake, saying how he founded 'orlando.
crichton91 everyone, this was, without a doubt, the best concert i have ever seen in my life. it was even better than Dave Matthews in concert. chris is incredible. his enthusiasm is intoxicating and contagious. its obvious that he loves his audience. the rest of the band just melds so well and does an awesome job. the light show made the whole experience exciting and it really reflects the music. the most memorable experience for me was in the opening number. the group comes out in the dark and gets in their places. and then they start right into politik with the stobe lights flashing in time with the music...incredible.
Chris played a new song..."Moses"...wonderful. "As Moses had power over the seas, so you have power over my heart." What romantic and beautiful lyrics.
thank you guys! an awesome and unforgettable experience! to everyone else...if this show comes within a couple hours of where you are, DON'T MISS IT!!!
On my way back to Miami I decided to see if I could get in the concert, but I couldn't make it back in time, by the time I got to UM the concert was halfway through, Oh Well.
Suz: Ah, fabulous show!After the Atlanta fiasco last fall, it was nice to see Coldplay in action. Wonderful setlist, I was surprised at hearing 'Warning Sign'. 'Moses' sounds like its going to be a great song as well. You folks in Miami have a wonderful show to look forward to tonight! I only wish I could make the rest of the southeast shows this week. (And I still can't believe we drove back to Jacksonville afterwards and I'm sitting here at work as we speak.)
EmpressKaren: The Orlando show was F-ing Awesome! Possibly the best live show I have ever seen. It was an intimate venue and the acoustics were great. Chris had so much energy, he was flailing all over the stage and the piano! The best part was that they are REAL musicians with REAL talent and artistry. Unlike so many other bands that are fabricated in the studio, what you hear on the CD is what you hear live. I would advise any Coldplay fan to see them if you get the opportunity! Absolutely Fabulously Beautiful!
Matt Vermin: Ok , this was , without a doubt , the best show I have ever seen . Every song was beautiful , and the crowd seemed to know every word of every song . I loved it . The interaction between Chris and the crowd was extraordinary . It was really a night to remember .
Nocturnel: Just saw the opening show of coldplays tour here in Orlando! I haven't had a religious experience in music since U2's Rattle & Hum. Wow! I think this is one of the most important bands of our time. It's an undergournd music revolution. They're brining artistry and real music to the forefront of the industry. You gotta see the show. Chris sang a new song, just him on acoustic guitar. He said it was about "the most beautiful girl" probably about Gwyneth. Good song. He also dedicated a song to Justin Timberlake for putting Orlando on the map. Really good show, really good times.
Kelly Sanchez: Coldplay was brilliant. They started the night off with "Politik" from their 2002 album A Rush of Blood to the Head. Immediately as the song began, flashing strobe lights mimicked Will Champion's erratic, hard drumbeats and introduced the illuminated fans to the band's absorbing, confident sound. Front man Chris Martin bounced all over his seat as he pounded his piano center stage. He looked as if he was impersonating Stevie Wonder with his wild back and forth head sways. Towards the end of the opening number, Martin busted out with his own rendition of "Chopsticks." The simplicity of the melody was intriguing.
Next, from their 2000 debut album Parachutes, Coldplay rocked with "Shiver." Martin stepped away from the piano and picked up his six-string. Like Beck, there was a wonderful oddness to him. He jumped around the stage in a way only the British can move. The wiry singer had charmed the crowd, encouraging them to sing along with him, which they excitedly did. Behind each note played, there was a deep, honest passion released. Guitarist Jon Buckland's distorted riffs and bassist Guy Berryman's riveting rhythm were full of genuine, raw emotion.
Due to Martin's voice strain, the British band had to cancel a number of American shows last year. Rumors of the band breaking up due to no more inspiration headlined newspapers all over England. But like all heroes, Coldplay shattered the scandals with their smash album A Rush of Blood to the Head and persevered through the controversies. Orlando's Roberta Markowitz said, "Coldplay's a great band. Whatever kind of genre you're into you can adapt to Coldplay's music. I think this concert was energetic. It was one of the most liveliest shows I've ever been to."
For their encore, Coldplay heated up Hard Rock Live Orlando with their latest release "Clocks," "In My Place" and "Trouble." Shawn Anastasia of Orlando summed the evening up perfectly when he said, "This show kicked some f*ing a$$."

A folded compact range configuration has been developed ant the Sandia National Laboratories` compact range antenna and radar-cross- section measurement facility as a means of performing indoor, environmentally-controlled, far-field simulations of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements of distributed target samples (i.e. gravel, sand, etc.). The folded compact range configuration has previously been used to perform coherent-change-detection (CCD) measurements, which allow disturbances to distributed targets on the order of fractions of a wavelength to be detected. This report describes follow-on CCD measurements of other distributed target samples, and also investigates the sensitivity of the CCD measurement process to changes in the ... continued below

A folded compact range configuration has been developed ant the Sandia National Laboratories` compact range antenna and radar-cross- section measurement facility as a means of performing indoor, environmentally-controlled, far-field simulations of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements of distributed target samples (i.e. gravel, sand, etc.). The folded compact range configuration has previously been used to perform coherent-change-detection (CCD) measurements, which allow disturbances to distributed targets on the order of fractions of a wavelength to be detected. This report describes follow-on CCD measurements of other distributed target samples, and also investigates the sensitivity of the CCD measurement process to changes in the relative spatial location of the SAR sensor between observations of the target. Additionally, this report describes the theoretical and practical aspects of performing interferometric inverse-synthetic-aperture-radar (IFISAR) measurements in the folded compact range environment. IFISAR measurements provide resolution of the relative heights of targets with accuracies on the order of a wavelength. Several examples are given of digital height maps that have been generated from measurements performed at the folded compact range facility.

Murray State's Digital Commons - Scholars Week: Two Homelands: An Analysis on Japanese American Identity
During World War II, the entire world was engulfed in six long years of external conflict. But for some, there was a considerable degree of internal conflict. Yamasaki Toyoko wrote a story of Japanese American brothers, Kenji, Tadashi and Osamu, who battle with themselves and their surroundings to capture a clear sense of identity. The brothers develop different ideas of self-identification, which clash with external opinions and beliefs. Yamasaki’s novel, Two Homelands, is an epic story of three brothers being torn between Japan and the United States. The three brothers separately define their identities while being caught between two cultures, two languages, and opposing factions both on and off of the battlefield. This presentation will illustrate the struggle that these three characters face in order to find their identities. Struggles include discrimination from both the American and Japanese sides of the war and forced internment as well as many others. Using examples from the text, I argue that national identity is formed through education, positive and negative experiences, and each character’s environment.

As we head into a new year, the most common question we receive is, “What’s the outlook for real estate in 2018?”
It’s not just potential buyers and sellers who are curious; homeowners also want reassurance their home’s value is going up. The good news is that a strong U.S. economy, coupled with low unemployment rates, is expected to drive continued real estate growth in 2018. However, changes on the horizon could significantly impact you if you plan to buy, sell or refinance this year.
Experts agree that home prices will increase in 2018, but predict a slower rate of appreciation than 2017, which clocked in at nearly 7 percent nationwide. National Association of Realtors (NAR) Chief Economist Lawrence Yun predicts a growth rate this year of 5.5 percent,1 while Freddie Mac’s September Outlook Report forecasts a rate of 4.9 percent. Either way, all indicators point towards continued growth in 2018.2
What does it mean for you? If you’re a current homeowner, congratulations! Real estate proves once again to be a solid investment over the long term. And if you’re considering selling this year, there’s never been a better time. Contact us to request a free Comparative Market Analysis to find out how much you can expect your home to sell for under current market conditions.
If you’re in the market to buy this year, there’s good news for you, too. Although prices continue to rise, the rate of appreciation has slowed. Still, don’t wait any longer. Prices will continue to go up, so you’ll pay more six months from now than you would today. Call us to setup a free, no-obligation property search and get notified about listings that meet your criteria as soon as (or before) they hit the market.
Lack of inventory in the housing market has been a primary impediment to homeownership for many Americans. “Ten years ago, the problem in the housing market was lack of buyers,” says Yun. “Today, the problem is lack of sellers. Inventory levels are near historic lows.”3
Yun also notes, “The lack of inventory has pushed up home prices by 48 percent from the low point in 2011, while wage growth over the same period has been only 15 percent. Despite improving confidence [in 2017] from renters that now is a good time to buy a home, the inability for them to do so is causing them to miss out on the significant wealth gains that homeowners have benefitted from through rising home values.”1
The good news? Yun expects a 9.4 percentage point increase in single-family new home construction starts.4
Economists at Freddie Mac make a similar prediction. “Existing home sales are unlikely to increase much going forward. Limited inventory will remain a consistent problem … Growth in home sales will be primarily driven by new home sales, which should continue to grind higher with single-family construction.”2
Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, agrees. “The markets that are going to grow are ones where builders can add that entry level product.”5
What does it mean for you? If you’ve been frustrated by lack of inventory in the past, 2018 may bring new opportunities for you to find a budget-friendly home that suits your needs. Give us a call to discuss options for new construction in our area.
The new entry-level construction will come with a catch though … it will be located in the suburbs, where the availability of land and fewer zoning requirements make it more cost-effective to build. Economists predict that’s where millennials and first-time buyers will flock for the greater variety of homes at affordable prices.6
Rising home prices, a sluggish job market, and an increase in student loan debt made homeownership largely unattainable for many millennials in past years. However, there’s significant evidence that this trend is turning around. For the fourth year a row, the National Association of Realtors’ 2017 Home Buyer and Seller Generational Trends survey found that millennials were the largest group of homebuyers.7
As millennials age, they are settling down and having families, which has prompted an increasing demand for larger but affordable homes. Thus, many are flocking to the suburbs, with 57 percent of millennial buyers opting for a suburban location.
What does it mean for you? If you’re a millennial who has been priced out of urban living, or is looking for more space for your growing family, a number of suburbs in our area have a lot to offer. We can point you towards the communities that will best meet your needs.
And if you’re a suburban homeowner with plans to sell, give us a call. We know how to market your home to millennials … and can help you sell quickly for top dollar by appealing to this growing market segment!
“Boomerang buyers” comprise the nearly 10 million Americans who lost their homes to foreclosure or short sales during the housing recession of 2006 to 2014.
According to MyFico.com, a foreclosure remains on a credit report for seven years. It takes many boomerang buyers at least that long to raise their credit score and save up enough cash to qualify for a new mortgage.8
With this “seven-year window” in mind, RealtyTrac predicts that the largest wave of boomerang buyers – more than 1.3 million – will be eligible to re-enter the housing market in 2018.9
Markets likely to see the highest influx of boomerang buyers are those that had a high percentage of foreclosures AND have remained affordable. The majority of boomerang buyers are middle-class Gen Xers or Baby Boomers. Expect to see even more competition for entry-level homes in those markets.
What does it mean for you? If you’re a boomerang buyer, we understand your unique circumstances. We can help you navigate the real estate process and write competitive offers that will play to your strengths. Contact us to discuss your options.
The “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” passed at the end of 2017 nearly doubles the standard deduction, so far fewer Americans are expected to itemize this year. For those who do, however, it could mean less homeowner deductions are available than in the past.
Previously, homeowners could deduct interest paid on the first $1 million of mortgage debt, but that threshold has been lowered to $750,000 for new mortgages. (Existing mortgages will not be impacted.)
Additionally, taxpayers will no longer be able to fully deduct state and local property taxes plus income or sales taxes. The new legislation restricts this deduction to $10,000. It also eliminates the deduction for moving expenses (except for members of the Armed Forces) and interest on home equity loans unless the proceeds are used to substantially improve the residence.10
It’s yet to be seen how the tax bill will impact the real estate market overall. While some economists predict a price reduction in certain markets, Republican lawmakers project the bill will increase take-home pay and stimulate the economy overall. According to Realtor.com Senior Economist Joseph Kirchner, “Some house hunters—particularly wealthy buyers—will see an increase in after-tax income, making an already tough housing market even more competitive. This increased demand could drive prices up even higher than they are already.”11
What does it mean for you? If you’re an existing homeowner, be sure to consult a tax professional if you’re concerned about the impact the new tax bill could have on you.
And if you’re planning to buy or sell this year, we can help you determine how the tax bill could affect demand in your current or target neighborhood and price range.
No one knows exactly what will happen with mortgage rates this year, but the Mortgage Bankers Association anticipates the Federal Reserve will raise rates three times in 2018, with Freddie Mac’s 30-year fixed rate mortgage reaching 4.8 percent by the end of Q4, up from around 4 percent at the end of 2017.12
Kiplinger.com Economist David Payne also predicts interests rates will rise this year, with short-term rates outpacing long-term rates as the Fed aims to curb inflation in a tightening job market. He predicts the bank prime rate that home equity loans are based on will increase from 4.25 percent to 5 percent by the end of 2018. 13
What does it mean for you? If you’re in the market to buy, act now. Rising interest rates will decrease your purchasing power, so act quickly before interest rates go up. Give us a call today to get your home search started.
Get pre-approved for a mortgage. If you plan to finance part of your home purchase, getting pre-approved for a mortgage will give you a jump-start on the paperwork and provide an advantage over other buyers in a competitive market. The added bonus: you will find out how much you can afford to borrow and budget accordingly.
Create your wish list. How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need? How far are you willing to commute to work? What’s most important to you in a home? We can set up a customized search that meets your criteria to help you find the perfect home for you.

All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident: Arthur Schopenhauer -- In questions of science the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual: Galileo Galilei -- Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's living at it: Albert Einstein -- When you have eliminated the impossible, what ever remains, however improbable must be the truth: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle -- We all agree that your theory is crazy, but is it crazy enough? Niels Bohr -- Whenever a true theory appears, it will be its own evidence. Its test is that it will explain all phenomena: Ralph Waldo Emerson -- Since the mathematicians invaded Relativity, I do not understand it myself anymore: Albert Einstein -- I would say that the aether is a medium invented by man for the purpose of propagating his misconceptions from one place to another: W.F.G. Swann: -- Most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple, and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone: Albert Einstein -- Physics is mathematical not because we know so much about the physical world, but because we know so little: Bertrand Russell -- If I could explain it to the average person, I would not have been worth the Nobel Prize: R. P. Feynman -- I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use: Galileo Galilei -- How dare we speak of the laws of chance? Is not chance the antithesis of all law?: Bertrand Russell -- Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I´m not sure about the former: Albert Einstein -- The glory of mathematics is that you don't have to say what you are talking about: Richard Feynman -- Anything is possible if you don´t know what you are talking about: Author Unknown -- In life, everything is relative - except Einstein´s theory: Leonid S. Sukhorukov -- Don´\'t worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you´ll have to ram them down people´s throats: Howard Aiken --A day will come undoubtedly when the ether will be discarded as useless: H. Poincaré -- First they tell you you´re wrong and they can prove it; then they tell you you´re right but it isn´t important; then they tell you it´s important but they knew it all along: Charles Kettering -- It is not once nor twice but times without number that the same ideas make their appearance in the world: Aristotle -- The opposite of a true statement is a false statement. The opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth: Niels Bohr -- A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it: Max Planck -- Euclid taught me that without assumptions there is no proof. Therefore, in any argument, examine the assumptions: Eric Temple Bell -- Half this game is ninety percent mental: Yogi Berra
McMahon field theory: Theoretical unification of relativity and quantum physics, thus methods to generate gravity and time
This theory is compared to many currently accepted scientific concepts, and is theoretical in nature. It is built upon the great works of Men such as Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Stephen Hawking, Johannes Kepler, Johannes Rydberg, Willem Jacob Gravesande, Erwin Schrödinger and others. It also presents some experiments that may be performed to confirm this theory. At the heart of this theory is special relativity- this paper presents a modified version of special relativity that explains how particles, when moving close to the speed of light, are observed as energy fields. Hence, this work is referred to as McMahon field theory, because a single particle moves as a “field” as it approaches the speed of light.

Located about 70 minutes train ride away from the Incheon International Airport in Seoul, the Ewha Hostel is a collective of 4 apartment blocks, spread across different locations, housing up to 30 different guest house apartments. Thus, with Ewha Hostel, it's difficult to know exactly what you're getting, because each is furnished differently. Furthermore, some apartments are newer, while others are aging.
Ambience at Ewha Hostel can differ, depending on the age of the guest house you're in. For me, the place was well lived in with signs of aging, however, at least it was clean. The walls are decorated with cute decor, and the security lock is sturdy. The surrounding location is rather quiet, within a few steps to Hongik University subway station exit 6, but it's nondescript and relaxing.
Rooms at Ewha Hostel are functional, but small. The beds are comfortable, but take up the majority of space in the room, however, there is sufficient wardrobe space. Though advertised for up to 6 guests, I find it's more comfortable for a maximum of 4 people. There is only 1 bathroom, which is clean, but we also spotted mosquitos several times within.
Food at Ewha Hostel can be prepared by yourself, using the fully equipped kitchenette. The stove is easy to operate, and I cooked 1 dinner here. Dish washing equipment is provided, as is simple and functional cutlery, though most are aging in appearance. You'll have to buy your own condiments and seasoning, besides the main ingredients.
Service at Ewha Hostel is excellent. The owner-host, along with her family, run the collective apartments, and will meet and usher guests personally, even though she has hired help. Very responsive to queries, usually replying text messages within 1 hour. During our stay, we also experienced a medical emergency, and the owner-host and her family rendered more than capable assistance, bringing us to an affordable nearby hospital, assisting with the administration, waiting together with us, and ensuring our comfort. Felt well-taken care of, more than we'd hoped for.
The facilities and activities at Ewha Hostel is limited to watching cable television, surfing the internet, cooking, or doing the laundry via the washing machine provided. However, Ewha Hostel is located within 5 minutes walking distance to many shops, restaurants, and convenience stores at the Hongdae area, as well as the Hongik University subway station. This makes Ewha Hostel a convenient place from which to explore the city.

Drug rehabilitation centers have come about as a blessing, not just for the sinking druggie, but for the society as a whole. Reforming and freeing individuals is a godly act. Not all can enjoy such activities. These centers are not like health centers or resorts in the real sense. They have to work with unpredictable human beings who at times can even turn violent.
The Church of Scientology, in addition to others, is extremely worried about the state of the world, and where drugs are taking us. The leaders of tomorrow, those choice makers, are today’s youth, many of whom are using drugs now. Over a 3rd of Australians in between 14 years middle and old age have used illicit drugs. Last year there were over 85,000 illicit drug related arrests.
My mother taught me to provide and to anticipate worth for cash. She likewise taught me that I have 2 choices in this world: cut or bale (hay that is). She didn’t teach me that there is a 3rd choice: wallow.
Muscles need to be stretched regularly, and consisting of strolling, jogging or encountering your daily activities can do simply that. When muscles stretch, they likewise heat up, making us feel more relaxed, and undoubtedly giving us a better night’s sleep.
Now, the girl at the inpatient rehabilitation centers told me that they would help spend for the surgical treatment but she had experienced that it didn’t assist all that much and I probably would wind up having to wear a listening devices anyhow. So that prompted me to wish God to reveal this woman what He might do.
I am early into my healing, but taking a drink or doing drugs is not an alternative to me anymore. The hardest part of healing is changing your social routines. I do not go to bars or socialize with individuals who would activate me to drink. You will probably feel separated at initially, but assistance groups assist. You will begin to surround yourself with individuals who care and comprehend you. This is an INVALUABLE present. Do not feel embarrassed! Everyone has skeletons in their closets and satanic forces to handle. There will be small-minded individuals who gossip and talk, however time will pass and you will build deep relationship with individuals who have your finest interests at heart. You will start to feel a sense of hope, peace and stability.
Dependency treatment and inpatient drug rehab is best done through a multi-pronged approach. The specialists at the rehab center advise different drugs and programs that enable the person to recover in stages and rejoin the traditional society so that he or she can lead a typical life once again. So, it is not just drugs that do the work. Counseling plays a crucial function, and so does the individual attention that the person gets from the caregivers and specialists.
The expense of treatment is the main factor why patients fail in receiving treatment. Since of the high cost of inpatient rehab, numerous suffering from psychological health problems go un-treated. Finding a government subsidized program without downgrading services, perhaps an alternative.
By May 2007 she lost control of her vehicle and it added on a curb. The Beverly Hills cops found cocaine and that she was owning under the impact of alcohol. Lindsay Lohan then got in the Promises Treatment Center for 45 days, her 2nd effort at rehab. She used a SCRAM bracelet while she was in outpatient care.
Inpatient rehabilitation centers are by far the most reliable in dealing with addiction. Long term treatments are better than short-term ones according to statistics. This sort of facility guarantees convenience, security, and safety. The patient gets to stay in an environment devoid of drugs and alcohol. Family and pals can visit from time to time when the client chooses to leave before completing the program, the family is instantly notified. Most significantly, alcohol and drug abuse clients can easily recover when they are with individuals whom they share the exact same issues and whom they can quickly associate with.

National Landscape Waterland has plotted out six wonderful bicycle routes through the area, the lengths of which vary between 30 and 40 km. Read Through...
Rural Waterland is special enough for the Netherlands to designate it as one of the National Landscapes, because of its particular cultural, historical, natural and scenic qualities. Read Through...
Ours is a traditional Dutch farmhouse where two generations of farmers have worked the land and kept sheep.
It is situated on the edge of the village of Broek in Waterland. The farmhouse is on the route of migrating birds and surrounded by meadows with grazing sheep and cows.
We have the pleasure to introduce ourselves as one of the leading hotels in Jaisalmer. Our hotel has historic character and is suitable for both long and short stays.
This is one of the best hotels in the City of the Jaisalmer, with neat and clean and sofisticated services, i found hotel staff very frineedly and helpful. Roomes are very specious with all moderna facility with traditional & cultural touch.
Roof top view was amzing in night spcially while having a dineer under the beautiful sky full of stars and fort view was amzing. Its hardly ten minutes walk to the for
Although this new hotel isn't in the fort, it has wonderful fort and desert views and is a little oasis. It had only recently opened when we stayed but they've hit the ground running. It's clean, with comfortable beds and the staff are charming.
Helsinki House really made my time in Jaisalmer - the views were so wonderful you felt like you were still exploring even after returning to the hotel. The people were warm and the decor was lovely. Ticked all the boxes for me and I would highly recommend it.
This hotel reminds of Scandinavia due to its use of natural interior materials and cleanliness. The interior designing gives a feeling of medieval period. Very good authentic cuisine served. Highly recommended if you visit this golden city.
At the edge of the Gadisar lake this beautiful sandstone hotel has uninterrupted views out across the desert sands, a monsoonal lake and the golden city, Jaisalmer. The breathtaking intricate designs on the façade of the hotel have been hand carved by local artisans, giving a palatial feel to this boutique establishment. This feeling is enhanced when you step inside each of the individually designed suites that inspire the magic of India.
The name "Helsinki House" is a tribute to the city that gave Ali Khan (the owner) the opportunity to turn his childhood dream into a reality. Ali khan is living and working in Helsinki, Finland and he was born in a small village town 30km outside of Jaisalmer. He arrived in Jaislamer at the age of 7, to work for an uncle . This is a true rags to riches story of a desert boy who dreamed of one day building a hotel and through many years of hard work, a little bit of luck and a whole lot of charm, his vision has come to fruition.
Each room in Helsinki house has been individually designed so please take the time to view our rooms and choose the one that tickles your fancy.
Rooms feature king size or twin beds with 12 inch soft mattresses, soft pillows, crisp white linen and desert crafted decorative bedspreads. The marble bathrooms have fluffy white towels, complimentary toiletries and hair dryers. The rooms also have air conditioning, multi-channel LED televisions, tea and coffee makers and 24 hour room service. There are also DVD players, movies and international newspapers available upon request.
White curtains billow from a 4 poster canopy bed as you bask in the scent of jasmine on the desert breeze. (fix spellings)
Sink into old world charm with the chink of crystal, ice and whiskey swirling together. Exhale the days chaos while gazing out at an horizon of shimmering desert sands.
Cascading light dances across the room like fat drops of rain falling from heavy summer skies. Wash away the desert dust while submerging yourself in a tub with stunning views of the enchanting golden city.
From the spinning wheel to the spinning girl, vibrant threads weave a world of colour across stark desert plains. See the splendour in the stillness.
Cardamom, cinnamon and ginger swirl through your nostrils, as a touch of chilli tickles your tongue. Be dazzled by the kaleidoscope patterns of herbs and spices.
Kick off your cultural shackles and let the music burst through you like fireworks in a dark night sky. Be seduced by the intense, exuberance of Bollywood suit
If there is anything else you require please ask our friendly staff and we will do our best to accommodate your request.

n an advertising campaign in 2008 the U.S. Air Force declared itself to be “Above All”. The slogan and symbol of the campaign was similar to the German “Deutschland Über Alles” campaign of 1933. It was a sign of things to come.
On Thursday Masha Gessen watched the press briefing of White House Chief of Staff General John Kelly and concluded:
The press briefing could serve as a preview of what a military coup in this country would look like, for it was in the logic of such a coup that Kelly advanced his four arguments.
Those who criticize the President don’t know what they’re talking about because they haven’t served in the military. …
Gessen is late. The coup happened months ago. A military junta is in strong control of White House polices. It is now widening its claim to power.

Donald’s Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was told to hand himself over to federal authorities, as was one of his former business associates, it was reported on Monday.
According to the New York Times, Manafort and Rick Gates, who was a junior business partner of Manafort’s, are the first people to face charges in the investigation run by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, and the Trump campaign’s possible collusion in that effort.
U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, tasked with pursuing collusion between Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia, just planted the first stake.
Prosecutors on Mueller’s team revealed Monday that a foreign policy adviser on Trump’s campaign, George Papadopoulos, pursued Russia’s help in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and sought to open communication lines to the Kremlin. Papadopoulos worked with an international professor who promised compromising information from Russia about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. He also met with a Russian woman he believed could broker a meeting between the campaign and Russian officials.
He then lied about the timing and content of those interactions to agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. On October 5, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying in a sealed document that was made public Monday in Washington D.C. Ominously for the White House, Papadopoulos is cooperating with the investigation.
Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, has been indicted on conspiracy against the US, money laundering, and a slew of other charges, according to the office of the Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
Never mind the big hitters, Manafort & Gates, for now. Little George Papadopoulos seems to have been flipped 'over easy' and what he's agreed to spill could turn out to be the first real sledgehammer to the dotard's Witch Hunt spin.

It is so much fun watching them fill out the letter each year. Reese and Emma checked the box that they "were good all of the time". Scarlett checked the box that she was "good some of the time", which made me laugh! Georgia...well, Georgia got checked for the box that said "naughty (but nice!)". They wrote that they would like beanbags and mini American Girl dolls. I think their drawings to Santa are the best!

Zenobia Renquist lives in her imagination. When not traveling through her fantasy worlds, she can be found in Hawaii living with her husband and two cats.
She is an Air Force brat turned Air Force wife, which means she’s accustomed to travel and does it whenever possible (so long as
On the few occasions her muse flees the scene of the crime, Zenobia likes to read (comics, manga, and romance), go to the movies, play a few levels of whichever puzzle game has hijacked her interest or experiment with a new chain maille weave.
What do a four hundred-year-old vampire and a mid-level necromancer have in common? Money. Jeliyah needs it to pay off the people who trained her and Teaghan enjoys killing to get it. Together they hunt rogue vampires—assuming Teaghan can focus on something other than getting her in bed and Jeliyah doesn’t put a bullet in him first.
The uneasy partnership promises to be lucrative until Teaghan and Jeliyah get on the wrong side of a feud. Jeliyah is forced to use forbidden magic and finds herself bound to a man she should hate—but whom she can’t stop fantasizing about.
Every second they stay alive fuels a growing desire Jeliyah is unwilling to deny. Is it the magic? The danger? The only way to get the answers she craves is to outrun the enemy or kill them. She knows Teaghan’s preference but it’s Jeliyah who must put their mind-blowing sex aside and make the choice that will decide both their fates.
Zenobia will be awarding a $25 Starbucks GC to both a randomly drawn commenter during the tour, and a randomly drawn host. so leave a comment and follow the tour for more chances to win.
Teaghan kicked the room door shut behind him and then laid her on the nearest bed. “At least this time you’re not glowing. Let’s not make a habit of this.”
Images of Teaghan running his hands over her breasts and teasing her nipples entered her mind. She reared up and smacked him at the same time she brought her other arm up to guard her chest.
Teaghan didn’t react except to grin at her. “You’re flushed, necromancer. Your heart rate jumped too. My little idea get you all hot and bothered?”
A mental picture of Teaghan yanking off her panties so he could run his tongue over her clit invaded her mind. The detail was so vivid Jeliyah felt her pussy twitch in anticipation. Damn the man and this stupid mental connection. It might be one way, but she had access to his thoughts and now he wasn’t trying to hide them. “You can’t do that without an
“Sun’s got nothing to do with me.” He moved closer, planting his hands on either side of her legs and leaning into her. “Invite me.”
Jeliyah scooted back off the bed and away from him. Once on her feet, she said, “Don’t get all cocky just because I took some of your blood, vampire. I told you that was a one-time thing and not to get ideas.”
“Yeah, I heard you but,” he hopped the bed and crowded her against the wall, “here’s the thing. You could have gotten the same results by asking me to open a vein. A simple prick to the finger for a few drops of blood would have sufficed. You kissed me, necromancer.”
“It was a split-second decision. Back off.” She clutched the necrome at her throat and said, “Shield.”
Teaghan laughed as the shield expanded to include him. “Forget something important, did you? Your necromes recognize me now. I’m not a threat.”
Shit. She’d forgotten one of the major side effects of Recognize. Her necromes—and any others made from her blood—no longer worked against Teaghan. There was no way to deactivate Recognize either, just like an invitation once given.
“Kissing is the one thing I don’t need an invitation to do.” He pushed his lips against hers as he forced her hands over her head and pressed his body closer.
Jeliyah couldn’t turn from the kiss, though she tried. This wasn’t fair. Vampires needed permission to enter a person’s body. Why didn’t that extend to kissing? And why was she giving in to his kiss?
I might be tempted to go rogue myself if you could guarantee me some one on one with Teaghan ;) LOL!!
My husband rocked his father's hat and planned a huge Halo Wars party, complete with a Training Mission, a "fill up your own bag" candy bar, and Dye Wars Battle.
I have never seen that many boys running around with that much food coloring on their person. Needless to say, though the parents were forewarned, they looked a little shocked at the deep blue and vibrant red hands their boys were sporting. :)
The sound of my sweet boy squealing like a girl (don't tell him I said that) and continuously hugging his dad was all the thanks I needed. T3 is one of the most kindhearted, loyal, faithful and sarcastic 10 year olds I have ever known. I say this every year, but I am so proud of him...and delight that God ordained him a Tolson and we get to spend a lifetime loving on that kid.
Fun was had by all.. especially my boy. He is certainly going to remember the time his daddy planned a great day for him.
- It is July here in sunny San Diego. And thus far, we have had quite the mild weather. The Lord is to be praised. Especially since our a/c is currently broken, waiting on the delivery of a new motor. I'm hopeful that the motor will arrive before the inevitable heat wave.
- I've been scaling down my facebook time as I find the more I'm on it, the more insecure I become. I am learning to cut out those things that amp up the insecurity in myself, and fb just happens to be one of them. Keeping it real, y'all.
- My heart is breaking for a vast amount of people in our lives whose marriages are ending. I'm just flabbergasted at the casual way Christ followers view marriage. I feel like I can say this because Todd and I have been through hell and back, and we have both wanted to end it desperately. We chose to stay and fight for our marriage, our life together, our kids. It is hard and ugly and painful, but there is redemption at the end, and it is worth the difficulty.
- It is 11:46 at night and there is a very loud songbird that doesn't know it is bedtime. Every night with the chirping and the singing and the whistling. This bird drives me a little nutty, but also makes me smile. It's like she doesn't know she is supposed to be doing something different, so she does her own thing anyway. And yes, she is a she. And her name is Aretha. ;)
- I love having good good friends over to watch silly shows. Community is a beautiful wonderful thing.
- I had a very tough phone call earlier today, and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to proceed. I care deeply about my relationships, so when there is strife anywhere in any of them, I am greatly affected. Lots of prayer. Lots of prayer.
- BJ's has the yummiest gluten free pizza I have had in a long while. Cheesy goodness for $8.95. Yum. And poo.. now I want some.
- And do you see what I just did?? I just saw it, and I am floored. I wrote an uncomfortable emotional thought, and the next thought was one of food. God is healing me from that form of comfort, but man, I have a long way to go.
If that was the reason for my writing this post late at night, then good. One of my prayers has been to have my eyes opened to my destructive ways. And honestly, I need some Jesus time, so I am signing off for now.
..you are a responsible, hardworking, godly man thus teaching our son how to be one, and teaching our daughter how to recognize one.
..you tuck our children into bed most every night, complete with snuggles/wrestling/and prayers. And sips of water. And ice packs.
..you take excellent care of Mommy when she is sick (which is alot) and little eyes are watching that compassionate care-taking.
Honestly, the list is nearly endless. These are the things that are freshest on my mind right now. I didn't get you a card, but thought a virtual declaration would be fitting.
Man alive... I love you. We have been.through.some.STUFF. But there is Redemption and it is amazing. And I wouldn't want another soul to be the father of our 2 squishes that we have been blessed with.
I keep reading how fast everyone feels June has snuck upon us. It has. There is a quote I love that keeps running through my brain.. "The days are long, but the years are short."
I am sitting here, listening to the quiet hum of the air conditioner. My desk is a mess. There is a book on the dangers of MSG I have yet to crack open. There are papers scattered about. My daughter left her tiny white bowl here instead of placing in the sink. She is easily distracted.. much like her mamma. The bowl has little dots of blue, red, and yellow from her handful of m&m's she was blessed with for dessert.
Sidenote... I'm a big proponent of little treats a couple of times a week. My children are happily satisfied with 20 dark chocolate chips, or the rare handful of m&m's. May it always, always be so. :)
I don't have a huge theme for this post. I was simply overwhelmed with much love for my sweet, ordinary, wonderful family. I have thoughts such as these all the time, and figured I should "pen" them lest I forget.
My pre-teen boy-man.. who is the most handsome thing I have seen. His heart is so tender.. I am already afraid of what I shall have to restrain myself from if some girl dare to break it. On the flip side, helping him not become a heartbreaker himself will be a worthy goal. Loving the fact that after a delish BBQ Chicken Salad dinner, he wanted to go play on the elliptical for 20 minutes. Loving even more that he still thinks it's playtime, and not mandatory.
My "8 year old going on 13" sassypants of a daughter, who also has a sweet tender little heart. I fear even more what I shall do to the boy who chooses to casually play with that fragile precious thing. Sometimes (read multiple times a day) her tenderness gets buried under a loud voiced tyrant.. Yay... ;) Jesus obviously knew I needed to pray more.. thus He blessed me with her. Oh what He has taught me. Love that she came home from school and put on one of her fancy dresses to get ready for a concert. She wrote her own song, put on her heels, and was too adorable for words. She is quite shy, so the fact that she feels comfortable enough to do that warms me.
My hubs, who is so stressed right now. Who melts me when he gets a certain tiny smile on his face. It's the smile that makes him look about 5, and I just want to hug his neck off when I see it. He is all man though, so he might not be too thrilled I feel that way... ;) Loving that he loves my super healthy chocolate pb banana smoothies and requests one nightly. (Recipe to follow)
Please don't mis-read. We here at the Tolson house have had more ups and downs in our 12+ years as a family unit that I would care to explain. In fact, we are in a down moment as I type. But, I am still choosing to be grateful for the great things. God's blessings can still be found, they are just harder to locate sometimes.
That's it.. pop in a blender and blend until smooth. I came up with this as an alternative to the highly caloric Jamba Juice Chocolate PB Smoothie.
Feelings are lame sometimes. I am such an emotional person, so I feel alot. Every minute of every day, I'm hyper aware of feelings.
Why did God make us with such enormous capacity to feel. He doesn't just flippantly create things. There is always a purpose. So, I have been asking myself lately.. what is the purpose of feelings?
I feel heart broken to my very core when I hear a story of hurtful words said to one of my children.
The truth is.. our lives can be completely over-run by our feelings. Isn't that why the Bible talks about the heart being deceitful? We can't trust it.. it doesn't always tell the Truth. Knowing this.. it can almost drive me mad when I hear people say follow your heart. Really? Because, quite frankly, my heart is really untrustworthy when it comes to making wise decisions, and no.. I would not like to follow my heart. I would like to follow Jesus. And trust... that when my feelings are likely to suffocate me, there is power in leaning on His Truth, His Word. I can claim His Truth in any situation, instead of leaning into my own feelings. Lean into Him.
Oh, there is no doubt that it is hard. Maybe one of the most difficult things this emotional basket case of a woman has overcome. But by God's mighty hand, living in the midst of untruthful feelings is becoming a thing of the past. An old me. God is making a new me, and I could feel more joyful about that. :)
You know those days where you just don't have the stamina to cook dinner?? Which is mostly every day for me... haha. Well, tonight was one of them. My delighful daughter woke up at 1am with a bad headache and decided not to go back to sleep until about 5am.
I think the weather must have had something to do with both of us getting ill, but all is well now, so I am going to stop complaining about it!!
If you know us, you will know that we have been gluten free for about a year and a half. It has been a challenge to find easy suppers that this tired/migrained/fibro-flared up momma can make. I praise the Good Lord for Trader Joes and that gf living has become quite mainstream. It makes it a bit easier. :)
So, imagine my delight at finding a gluten free, preservative free, nitrate free roast beef hash that isn't too expensive! The current price is $2.49 a package and I love that! I mean, I might have danced in the Trader Joe's aisle a bit over this one. It may even have been to a classic Beach Boys song, but one cannot be certain.
So, when the migraine/fibro flare knocks at my door, and my sweet hubby is working (read.. I can't call him to go and get In N Out..) I love having a 5 minute, healthier than fast food meal at the ready.
Honestly, I flash fried the organic eggs, wilted the organic spinach and warmed up the hash, and it was on.
I love this time of year. My business side has usually slowed down considerably from the Christmas madness, and I can breathe, take photos when I want, nap, re-connect with friends, cook, read, just enjoy living. I mean, who wouldn't like this season??
One of the blogs I love to read is GlutenFreeGirl's site. When our family first went gluten free, hers was the first site to pop up in my searches. She is such a phenomenal writer that I spent a week devouring her blog from start to finish. And then, I went out and got her book. I'm not sure I would have made the transition as easily if it weren't for people like her.. willing to share their journeys, the ups and the downs.. so I could learn and grow too. Thanks Shauna!
If you are gluten free, beginning, or seasoned.. take a moment to stop by her site. It is a veritable wealth of gf knowledge freely shared. :)
7th grade. Chubby girl. First chair flute player. Thick straight frizzy hair with a wall of bangs that I made my mom perm every 6 weeks thankyouverymuch. I had such a poof on the top of my head.. girl, I was a mess. Needless to say, I was a walking target for meanies.
However, I was put into Weight Watchers at age 11, (oh, trust me.. I'm in therapy for that!) grew a few inches and over one summer became the skinny popular 8th grader. My bangs had grown out a bit, and I replaced flute with drama club. I even was class speaker at graduation.
High school was even sadder than 7th grade. My weight came back on with a venegance and I returned to the social suicide that was "Organized School Music Programs" only this time it was show choir. I mean, I could not get any hotter my people.
Debbie Downer moment, if I may.. I believe this is one of the moments when I realized that, in this twisted culture of ours, if skinny=good, then chubby=bad. Math was not my forte, but that was one simple equation I could figure out. Oh, how I desperately wish I could go back to that sweet little 15 year old and tell her a few things.
Why the outpouring of emotions tonight on my unsuspecting blog?? Well, for one, I am in the full throes of pms. Yay! TMI?? Secondly, my sweet squishy 8 year old daughter is dealing with a mean girl of her own. And boy, I have never wanted to pick a fight with a mean girl more than I do right now, even if she is only 9.
The short of it.. this little girl has been harassing my little girl for almost 2 years, off and on. We have constantly tried to encourage our bubba to stand up for herself in hopes we can teach her some life lessons about how life is hard, Love is the answer.. blah blah blah.. and up until this point, it was mostly playground hierarchy.
However, when said mean girl gets an entire table of 2nd graders to make fun of my daughter over her lunch contents? And my daughter comes home telling me an entire table accused her of passing gas because she was eating a smelley hard boiled egg?? And she doesn't want to eat eggs ever again?? And mean girl told people at the table to smell my daughter's booty?? Umm.. Mamma Bear (and Papa Bear for that matter) are. on. it. On it!
I am absolutely positive of this fact.. if every girl knew these things without a doubt, our world would change radically. I know my world would have been vastly different had I understood that a little earlier.

Jaisalmer, nicknamed as "The Golden city", is a town in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is located 575 kilometres west from the state capital Jaipur. It was once known as Jaisalmer state. The town stands on a ridge of yellowish sandstone, crowned by a fort, which contains the palace and several ornate Jain temples. Many of the houses and temples are finely sculptured. It lies in the heart of the Thar Desert (great Indian desert) and has a population of about 78,000. It is the administrative headquarters of Jaisalmer District. Once a sleepy desert city, Jaisalmer has transformed itself into a major tourist destination of India. Situated amid picturesque Thar Desert, the Jaisalmer city commands premiere position among the tourist attractions scattered all over the desert land of Rajasthan. The Jaisalmer city is revered both by Indians as well as foreign tourists.
Desert safaris on camels have become increasingly popular around Jaisalmer. Domestic and international tourists frequent the desert seeking adventure on camels for anything from a day to several days. This ecotourism industry ranges from cheaper backpacker treks to plush Arabian night style campsites replete with banquets and cultural performances. During the treks tourists are able to view the fragile and beautiful ecosystem of the Thar desert. This form of tourism provides income to many operators and camel owners in Jaisalmer as well as employment for many camel trekers in the desert villages nearby.

Perth has a growing small bar culture that is rapidly becoming renowned across the globe as one of the most unique and interesting aspects of the local tourism. Small bars are not just intimate, they are a great way to discover new things and have an experience like no other.
I headed off with Two Feet and A Heartbeat to discover these hidden gems as a part of the Home Roaming Project, with no expectations I was simply blown away with the amazing places we found.
Two Feet and a Heartbeat have been running the Eat Drink Walk Perth tours for some time now and have had some seriously big reviews- ranking in the top 10 of Perth to-do’s on Trip Adviser. I can definitely see why- the guide (Ellie) was simply amazing, she knew her history, bar culture and knew how to involve everybody- which in an intimate setting like this was vital. The best part- this tour is constantly evolving. As the bar scene grows and new ones open, the tour seems to find the pick of the bunch and you are really surprised where some of these places pop up! This brings me to the fine facilities we visited, Canton Bar, Belasyse and Choo Choo’s.
Asian inspired and only known to those who can find it- this place was my favourite. Up a winding staircase in the quieter part of town, Canton is really different. From the funky interior to the little rooftop smokers lounge, it is so qwerky and cool. Here we tried some of the tapas style specialties like steamed pork buns and endame beans- really good food and great service. This is a secret from the masses but it really must be shared!!!!
This tiny storage space has been converted into one of Perth’s best cocktail bars. The tenders have over 15 years’ experience and it really shows. No menu- no price list- it’s all up to you what you want. This concept is so great because everybody gets talking and you experience the bar scene in a way most haven’t- getting to know the bar staff and creating something magical, together! This place hold only 90 people at capacity, so it is very intimate and very cool.
Named after Bridget Belasyse, the mistress of Sir Shafto that died of a broken heart, Belasyse Bar brings you a gloomy, fairy tale-gone-wrong vibe and is interesting in many ways. The bar and restaurant has an alfresco and the interior seating, fountains and some cool artwork that gets you talking. Add some awesome cocktails and this place is perfect for a casual lunch with friends.
Hit up Two feet and a heartbeat tours across Perth and Sydney for a reasonably priced, exciting tour that leaves you full bellied (and a little tipsy!)

Ever notice how your skin changes when a new season rolls around? Just when you thought you finally had your skin under control, it starts up a whole new fuss--whether it's breaking out or flaking out, you don't have to be freaking out.
* If you're suffering from break-outs, don't immediately reach for a heavy-duty cleanser as it can further irritate your skin and cause more break-outs. Instead, try using a sea-salt skincare toner or sea-salt towel mask. Dissolve a tablespoon of sea-salt in a cup of water and use it as a regular toner. The salt will act as a disinfectant for your skin and relieve inflammation. You can also use a warm and damp towel and toss sea-salt all over one side of it and press that side of the towel onto your face and leave it for 5-10 minutes. The heat and dampness of the towel will dissolve the salt and let it seep into your skin.
* If you're suffering from dry, flaking skin, try exfoliate your skin once a week with a gentle facial brush and always put on an emollient moisturizer right after you wash your face, when your skin is still a little damp to lock in moisture. I think moisturizers that contain honey are great for dry skin because honey is a natural moisturizer that our ancestors have been using for centuries. The only honey moisturizer that I've ever used is from Burt's Bees but I'm sure other brands work just as well. Just make sure honey is near the top of the ingredients list or else the product probably won't give you the benefit of honey.
I also recommend a honey and yogurt mask: just add a teaspoon of warm honey to 2 teaspoons of yogurt. Apply to face (avoiding the eye area of course) and wait for 10 minutes and wash it off with warm water.
* If you're suffering from rosacea or skin allergies, the first thing you should do is simplify your beauty routine. The less products you use on your face, the less chance of you causing irritation. Use only a gentle, fragrance-free face wash and moisturizer and resist the urge of piling make-up on your face to hide the redness. I used to have bad rosacea and my skin just looked red all the time. I remember getting all sorts of green powders and green concealers to counteract the redness and believe me, it was stupid! I ended up looking like the incredible hulk and needless to say, I stopped using them.
I found that the easiest and fastest way to relieve these symptoms is to wash your face with cool water. After I switched to a gentle cleanser and started washing my face with cool water, my rosacea gradually went away. If your skin allergy persists and you have little red bumps on your skin, avoid using perfume and scented hairspray, avoid inflammatory foods such as coffee, chocolate, sugar, dairy, peanuts, red meat and processed/fast foods. Look for natural skincare products that contain aloe, feverfew, or colloidal oatmeal as these all help with healing the skin and calming irritation.
Remember, less is more when it comes to skincare in the face of changing season. Be sure to include gentle and natural products in your skincare. Always go for preservative-free and fragrance-free alternatives!
Healthy living does not have to equal buying everything organic or spending big dollars. Take one step at a time, simply your beauty routine, discover ways to bring more natural substances into your life.

The mineral movement has taken the cosmetics world by storm. Against the backdrop of conventional make-up, mineral cosmetics shine as a better alternative that actually allows your skin to breathe. I personally am a big fan of mineral makeup and am a witness to their amazing results and benefits, but I am very careful of the minerals that actually goes on my face.
First of all, I never go near any of that advanced nano-particle stuff that big companies promote. They supposedly ground the mineral particles so fine and claim that these refined particles adhere better to your skin and give a natural finish. When particles are so fine that they literally absorb into your skin and finds a way into your system, then you're putting yourself at risk, even if you believe mineral makeup is harmless.
Second, I find that most mineral makeup contain some mica and titanium dioxide. Mica is that shiny stuff that gives the skin a nice shimmer and glow and titanium dioxide provides some sun protection. Mica might not be the best option for oily skin and I've known people with this skin type who hated some brands of mineral makeup because they contained high amounts of mica and caused shine and blemish. More importantly, These particles of mica and titanium dioxide, when inhaled, do irritate your lungs and lead to inflammation or more devastating conditions over long exposures. I never ever use loose powder of any kind because the powder flies everywhere and I feel like I'm dusting a chalk board. Pressed powders are better, but liquid or solid foundations are the best because they eliminate the inhalation dilemma completely.
Last but not least, don't purchase mineral makeup and believe that you're not in danger. KNOW the ingredients in the product and PROTECT yourself against lurking threats to your health.
There’s not much happening, so here are a few random pictures, including some from a hike at Nature Areas 1 and 2 at Trent University in Peterborough.
Fall is usually a great time of year. We stop fighting each other over politics and race, and go back to not liking each other because of what football team we support. Oh, wait – now the NFL has combined the two, and there is no respite.
As a result of feckless national anthem protests and Nike deciding to pay muddled malcontent Colin Kaepernick millions to be the tattooed face of the company, viewership of the NFL is down another 13 percent. After being down last year when all this began, NFL viewership is now at a 10-year low.
The numbers are particularly down in the South. We lead the country in football and love of country, followed closely by meth, diabetes and obesity. But SEC football is king. And the only reason Southerners kneel at a football game is if our bourbon flask falls out of our sock.
We love the national anthem too! What’s not to like? The song has bombs in it and rockets going off. It is like the Fourth of July, the day we celebrate the last time we had all 10 fingers.
The Kaepernick protest is not heroic. Kaepernick almost never gives interviews since he looks bad when asked simple questions. He idealizes socialism and Castro, whose brutal regime murdered up to 33,000 Cubans. I guess his college, U. Nevada at Reno (the Fighting Blackjack Dealers), didn’t teach history well.
He just tweets and re-tweets others. He has tattoos all over his body and neck, so he's not exactly a long-term thinker.
Kaepernick was a washed-up quarterback on a losing team who had no real contract renewal prospects. Like Democrats, he turned conjured up grievances into a business. He clearly has his right to complain, but he does not have the right to lie about the facts.
As the Manhattan Institute's Heather MacDonald’s FBI data studies point out, the Black Lives Matter movement is based on and perpetuates a lie. While they are 6 percent of the population, black males represent 40 percent of all cop killers. A Police officer is 18.5 times more likely to be shot by an African-American male than an unarmed black male is likely to be killed by a cop. "Social justice" on that for a moment.
So why did Nike hire Kaepernick? Are they tone-deaf leftists living in a Portland bubble? Do they hate middle-America so much they want to put Kaepernick out there in our faces and label him a hero, absent any facts to support it?
It will be easy to boycott Nike, since all their shoes and products are made in the same Chinese sweatshops as Adidas and other competitors. In fact, Nike spends about $10 billion a year on celebrity endorsement deals, one-half of their expenses. And Lebron or Kaepernick wearing their shoes does not make the shoes any better, just more costly. If you are enough of a dope to buy a pair of shoes because you think a sports star wears them of his own volition, for no pay, then you get what you deserve.
There are other forms of sports entertainment, although the NFL is about to fumble its government-sanctioned monopoly on professional football. I prefer college football anyway, and by "college football" I mean the SEC.
Major League Baseball is heading into the playoffs. Baseball players don’t kneel during the National Anthem, so I have resumed watching the Braves. But where did all those long beards come from? MLB looks like the Union playing the Confederacy.
I love when the free market speaks. No government, no intervention, just capitalism punishing idiots and bad ideas. The stock market cut $4 billion off Nike’s value the day the Kaepernick deal was announced, and viewership continues to decline for the NFL.
Fans do not want to be preached to by some barely educated jocks who don't appreciate this country. We respect the flag. Hell, even Cleveland Browns fans take their paper bags off their heads for our National Anthem.
It is traditional to stand for any country’s national anthem. At the Olympics, the French not only stand for Germany’s national anthem, out of habit they put up their hands in surrender. I thought the Vietnamese delegation took a knee during our National Anthem, but it turns out they are just short.
We keep picking at the scab of race and it’s divisive. Rosanne Barr was fired over race. Maybe to bring the nation together, we should have her sing the National Anthem at an NFL game. It will bring everyone to their knees— and let the healing begin.

US CO2 emissions from energy production today are no higher than they were 18 years ago. Adjusting for energy produced and GDP produced we are seeing the beginnings of a decoupling. One would hope this is viewed as good news.
Suppose World Total GDP, which now stands at apx. $70 trillion, grows at about only 2% per year (ignoring population for a moment). This means that over the next 100 years, GDP will double approximately three times (use the rule of 69.3!). If you think total growth will be 3%, not at all unlikely, it will […]

I used to be “warmer” to the idea that climate change is a serious problem.

But when these sorts of […]
… and with zero calories too! The point of the cap and trade plan is to raise energy costs substantially – to intentionally NOT give consumers a break on winter heating costs. Have fun blaming that on greedy energy companies. I don’t think Americans are that dumb.
I am probably in the minority of citizens that is happy about $4.00 gas for political reasons. Politicians, seeing how much hardship is caused to lower and middle-income Americans when energy costs rise even modestly, seriously tone down their rhetoric regarding “doing something” about global warming. The dirty secret is that if you think $4.00 […]

Contact mechanism as a factor of nervous-vascular conflict realization in chronic neurological pain syndrome development
After seeing how many experiencers were on tumblr, I thought it was about time that ASMR Research & Support had a presence on the rising social networking site. It makes sense seeing as we’re on Facebook (a page and a group), Twitter, YouTube and there’s even a very large community on Reddit – and the more exposure we get the better. At first I debated whether or not I should go ahead and do it, seeing as I have so much other stuff going on as regards this entire project, and even outside it, but in the end decided to take the plunge.
You can find me over at tumblr, here. Note that the URL and tumblelog name are subject to change, but I’ll give you all notice if that happens, of course.
Right now I’m still getting used to the website and its tools, and so on. It’s not as advanced as say Blogger or Wordpress (not that I’ve used the latter one yet). It’s quite basic – but it is the place to be nowadays for casual blogging, as it seems to be competing against the likes of Twitter, the microblogging service that’s been around for a bit longer. I’m also still trying to figure out what to use it for, what content to put on there. I know I have plenty of unpublished blog posts that might fit nicely on there. So far I have a page with links to all the other main ASMR presences online.
Anyway, if you happen to visit the blog, you can follow me if you like. The site seems to combine elements of Formspring as well in the form of a questions feature, so perhaps if enough interest is garnered I’ll enable it and you can ask me questions or chat if we happen to be online at the same time.
I've had horrible migraines for years but within the last two years I've found using "ASMR" can manage and sometimes stop my migraines altogether (without medication!). In fact I have not taken my prescribed medication in over a year. I want to tell people! I want others with painful migraines to know this is real and can help ease your pain! I have NEVER told a single person about this "feeling", Ive had it and been able to almost control it since I was 10 or so but felt others wouldn't understand. So excited I'm not alone

By the year 2015, nearly half of the people living with HIV in the United States will be 50 years or older. This group consists of the following:
As the members of this group approach their senior years, they must grapple with a unique set of challenges. First, this group suffers two stigmas: that of HIV and that of aging. For example:
1. They must deal not only with the toll that HIV takes on the body but also with the effects of aging. Like HIV, aging affects the immune system. Older people with HIV are like-ly to have lower T-cell counts and more advanced disease than their younger counter-parts. When taking HIV medications, those in this age group are also less likely to experience an increase in their CD4 count than are younger people with HIV. However, older people with HIV are more likely to take their medications and control the virus.
2. Older people with HIV experience an accelerated aging process. A 55-year-old with HIV may have medical conditions that are common to an HIV-negative person in his or her 70s. For example, a 55-year-old HIV-positive person might have muscle loss, fatigue and bone loss, which are typically more common in older individuals. For that reason, people over age 50 living with HIV should be routinely tested for such conditions as heart disease, cancer, kidney function and dementia.
3. Older Americans are more likely to have conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and kidney disease. Since an HIV-positive older person is more likely to be taking medication for other ailments as well as for HIV, there is the possibility that an adverse reaction could occur as a result of the multiple medications.
An added complication for women is that some of the symptoms of HIV mimic the symptoms of menopause. For example, fatigue, hot flashes and facial flushing are common to both conditions. As a result, many women and physicians dismiss the symptoms, causing diagnosis to be delayed. How-ever, regular screenings for HIV can ensure that men and women over the age of 50 are diagnosed as early as possible, which is crucial to living longer with the disease.
When it comes to prevention, many people over age 50 are unknowingly putting themselves at risk for HIV.
• Men over age 50 who have erectile dysfunction may resist using condoms because doing so makes intercourse more difficult.
• Men and women who are widowed or divorced and becoming sexually active with a new partner may not be aware of their risk for the disease.
Compounding the problem is the fact that many physicians don’t talk with their patients about sex and the risk factors of HIV.
But the reality is that everyone should use a condom. Whether you’re male or female, young or old, if you have sex without a condom, you put yourself at risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.
If you are over age 50 and find yourself with an HIV diagnosis, there are many resources available to help you live a full and complete life.
• Antiretrovirals can re-store the immune system, though not to the extent that they would for someone younger.
• Depression screening can determine whether mental-health resources are needed. Depression is more common in an HIV-positive elderly person than in an HIV-negative elderly person.
While any person who receives an HIV diagnosis should get into treatment as soon as possible, those over 50 are particularly urged to get on ARVs right away. Because aging in itself has an adverse impact on health, early treatment can go a long way toward protecting your immune system.
Tamara E. Holmes is a Washington, D.C.-based journalist who writes frequently about emotional health and wellness.
“We’ve got to be as clear-headed about human beings as possible, because we are still each other’s only hope.”
James Baldwin’s words from a 1971 conversation with Margaret Mead hit home for me with particular poignancy as we come to the last days of the 2016 campaign for the Presidency. Many have voted already and many more have made up their mind for whom or even whether to cast a vote for President. I have also cast my vote and can in no way hold myself out as unbiased or equally receptive to either of the two likely outcomes. Still, my hope is that not a single person who reads this piece will feel influenced in any way regarding November 8th. What I take from Baldwin’s words is a powerful call for what we do on November 9th and the days after that. How do we recognize that as contentious and legitimately momentous the decision we each make is, the course of our nation and our collective wellbeing will be most affected by how we choose to relate to each other?
Politics, like religion, can touch the deepest core of our identity, of our hopes and of our fears. And here is the thing. While we all know rationally that there is no issue on which we all agree, it is another matter to take seriously those differences and respect those who hold diverse positions. One reason of course is that we don’t always want to. After all, this isn’t a friendly rivalry with little riding on the outcome. In a democracy we are invested with the power to make choices in which the stakes could not be higher. If someone not only supports another candidate, but thinks that your way of understanding things is deluded, corrupt, callous or just plain stupid… it is hard to be charitable, to even give them the benefit of the doubt.
It may seem that the only choice I have is taking a stand cutting off the other side, or adopting the idea that everyone has the right to have their own positions respected. Honestly, neither of these choices are satisfying. Why should I give blanket approval for worldviews and policy positions that run counter to everything I believe in? On the other hand, how can I allow my world of friends and conversation partners to dwindle just to the people that I know will agree with me?
Whoever wins the White House, there will be a significant number of people who feel betrayed, alienated, and angry. There will be many who feel disenfranchised from the political system that is supposed to represent our interests. Whether over a regulatory bureaucracy that seems ridiculously excessive if not corrupt, an economic system that favors the most wealthy, a persistence of racial injustice that can be especially fatal to black lives, a brutal and relentless threat of terrorism from perpetrators who profess to follow Islam, the backlash and general prejudice against the Muslims that make up part of the private and public religious mosaic of our country, the potential for devastating changes in climate and extinction of species that could change the face of the earth, sweeping changes in attitudes and policy that counter what some Christians hold dear, toxic xenophobia, or our country losing the security of its borders. An exhausting, but not exhaustive list that runs the gamut from what is traditionally seen as the left to the right of the political spectrum. No wonder there is such a sense of polarization and a resistance to even explore the perspective of the other side.
While many religious traditions provide their own paths to answer this question, I choose to turn to a different sacred text more suited for the discussion at hand. James Madison (despite not being the star of a brilliant musical) is often given credit for being the Father of the Constitution and under the name Publius, shared with John Jay and Alexander Hamilton, authored many of what became the Federalist Papers, brilliant essays teaching the ideas at the core of our Union.
In Federalist 10 Madison argues that any large nation must face the reality that if its participants have liberty they will seek to join together to fulfill particular desires, often at the expense of others’ liberty, property, and wellbeing. But short of stripping away liberty, there is nothing that can be done to curb the existence of what these factions whose cause is “sown in Human Nature.” Madison’s was not the only voice, of course,s and great figures such as Jefferson and Hamilton placed the emphasis differently. But Madison shows that democracy’s greatest purpose is also its greatest challenge: Only democracy allows for the liberty that is at the heart of human dignity, and yet liberty fans the flame of factions that can ultimately threaten the well-being of the nation. And this is the argument for the Constitution.
The Constitution, as Madison put it elsewhere, recognized that “government itself” is the “greatest of all reflections on human nature,” because “If men were angels, no government would be necessary” and “if angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.” But, as the story of the Flood teaches, we are not angels. And so we mustn’t have either a tyranny of the government nor a tyranny of the people’s will, but what Madison would call a democratic republic.
The United States of America was and continues to be an experiment in Republican Democracy, a nation instituted and authorized by the will of the people but governed by representatives counted on to think broadly enough to counter the narrowness of one perspective.
Madison and the Founding Framers sought to find a way that we could coexist with both our own liberty and responsibility for each other’s well-being. They knew before the modern failures of Communism and Fascism that the only way to do this was to commit to our more perfect Union. And this brings us back to James Baldwin’s urgent words “we are still each other’s only hope”

We all have been hearing the term Data Science and Data Scientist occupation become more popular these days. I thought of sharing some light into this specific area of science, that may seem interesting for rightly skilled readers of my blog.
Data Science is one of the hottest topics on the Computer and Internet nowadays. People/Corporations have gathered data from applications and systems/devices until today and now is the time to analyze them. The world wide adoption of Internet of Things has also added more scope analyzing and operating on the huge data being accumulated from these devices near real-time.
As per the standard Wikipedia definition goes “Data science, also known as data-driven science, is an interdisciplinary field about scientific methods, processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured, similar to data mining.”.
Data Science process involves collecting row data, processing data, cleaning data, data analysis using models/algorithms and visualizes them for presentational approaches. This process is explained through a visual diagram from Wikipedia.
Data scientists use their data and analytical ability to find and interpret rich data sources; manage large amounts of data despite hardware, software, and bandwidth constraints; merge data sources; ensure consistency of datasets; create visualizations to aid in understanding data; build mathematical models using the data; and present and communicate the data insights/findings.
They are often expected to produce answers in days rather than months, work by exploratory analysis and rapid iteration, and to produce and present results with dashboards (displays of current values) rather than papers/reports, as statisticians normally do.
“This hot new field promises to revolutionize industries from business to government, health care to academia.”
What are the skills required for a Data Scientist, let me share you a visualization through a Brain dump.
I thought of sharing an image to take you through the essential skill requirements for a Modern Data Scientist.

My brother Bill bought a USAF current issue CWU 45/P flight jacket recently. It's the genuine article, not a repro. In the pocket was a small US flag which velcros to the jacket. The odd thing is that the flag is "reversed"....the stars are on the right-hand-side of the patch, like a mirror image.
Can any of you fly-boy types explain why the flag is reversed? I've seen pictures on the web showing examples of this, but no explanation as to why.
thanks for that. I know that you guys treat your flag with far more reverence than us Brits treat ours..... that's why I was surprised to see the S & S modified in this way....
Well, some of us treat it with reverence due the symbol of the country.... others seem hell bent on doing the exact opposite.
Thanks for that. My bro goes everywhere in his jacket now. I probably wouldn't recognise him if he took it off

Foreigners will no longer be allowed to work in Saudi Arabia's numerous shopping malls, the labour ministry announced Thursday, in the latest measure to boost employment of Saudis.
The kingdom has intensified efforts to develop more jobs for its citizens under a wide-ranging drive that began last year to diversify the oil-dependent economy.
Known as Vision 2030, the plan calls for development of non-oil industries, small and medium enterprises, and a broader investment base.
"The Minister of Labour and Social Development issues a decision restricting the work in malls across the kingdom to only Saudi men and women," the ministry said on Twitter.
There were no further details on how or when the plan would be implemented. It is the latest step aimed at boosting local employment in a country where expatriates do everything from cleaning the streets, to waiting on tables and providing management expertise.
About nine million foreigners worked in the kingdom at the end of 2015, according to latest official figures.
Saudis have traditionally preferred jobs in the public sector, where hours are shorter and leave is longer, but the government is trying to cut its payroll.
It has for years offered incentives for companies to employ more Saudis and sanctioned those which did not meet targets.
Under new measures, the monthly fees paid by those who hire more foreign workers than Saudis will be increased, and in July the government plans to impose a levy on foreign workers with dependents, according to a government document seen by Bloomberg News.
In the third quarter of last year the unemployment rate for Saudi females was 34.5 percent, compared with 5.7 percent for Saudi males, figures cited by the firm Jadwa Investment showed.

Amalric (Latin: Amalricus; French: Amaury; 1136 – 11 July 1174) was King of Jerusalem from 1163, and Count of Jaffa and Ascalon before his accession. He was the second son of Melisende and Fulk of Jerusalem, and succeeded his older brother Baldwin III. During his reign, Jerusalem became more closely allied with the Byzantine Empire, and the two states launched an unsuccessful invasion of Egypt. Meanwhile, the Muslim territories surrounding Jerusalem began to be united under Nur ad-Din and later Saladin. He was the father of three future rulers of Jerusalem, Sibylla, Baldwin IV, and Isabella I.
Older scholarship mistook the two names Amalric and Aimery as variant spellings of the same name, so these historians erroneously added numbers, making Amalric to be Amalric I (1163–74) and King Aimery (1197–1205) to be "Amalric II". Now scholars recognize that the two names were not the same and no longer add the number for either king. Confusion between the two names was common even among contemporaries.[1]
Amalric was born in 1136 to King Fulk, the former count of Anjou who had married the heiress of the kingdom, Melisende, daughter of King Baldwin II. After the death of Fulk in a hunting accident in 1143, the throne passed jointly to Melisende and Amalric's older brother Baldwin III, who was still only 13 years old. Melisende did not step down when Baldwin came of age two years later, and by 1150 the two were becoming increasingly hostile towards each other. In 1152 Baldwin had himself crowned sole king, and civil war broke out, with Melisende retaining Jerusalem while Baldwin held territory further north. Amalric, who had been given the County of Jaffa as an apanage when he reached the age of majority in 1151, remained loyal to Melisende in Jerusalem, and when Baldwin invaded the south, Amalric was besieged in the Tower of David with his mother. Melisende was defeated in this struggle and Baldwin ruled alone thereafter. In 1153 Baldwin captured the Egyptian fortress of Ascalon, which was then added to Amalric's fief of Jaffa (see Battle of Ascalon).
Amalric married Agnes of Courtenay in 1157. Agnes, daughter of Joscelin II of Edessa, had lived in Jerusalem since the western regions of the former crusader County of Edessa were lost in 1150. Patriarch Fulcher objected to the marriage on grounds of consanguinity, as the two shared a great-great-grandfather, Guy I of Montlhéry, and it seems that they waited until Fulcher's death to marry. Agnes bore Amalric three children: Sibylla, the future Baldwin IV (both of whom would come to rule the kingdom in their own right), and Alix, who died in childhood.
Baldwin III died on 10 February 1163 and the kingdom passed to Amalric, although there was some opposition among the nobility to Agnes; they were willing to accept the marriage in 1157 when Baldwin III was still capable of siring an heir, but now the Haute Cour refused to endorse Amalric as king unless his marriage to Agnes was annulled.[2] The hostility to Agnes, it must be admitted, may be exaggerated by the chronicler William of Tyre, whom she prevented from becoming Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem decades later, as well as from William's continuators like Ernoul, who hints at a slight on her moral character: "car telle n'est que roine doie iestre di si haute cite comme de Jherusalem" ("there should not be such a queen for so holy a city as Jerusalem"). Nevertheless, consanguinity was enough for the opposition. Amalric agreed and ascended the throne without a wife, although Agnes continued to hold the title Countess of Jaffa and Ascalon and received a pension from that fief's income. Agnes soon thereafter married Hugh of Ibelin, to whom she had been engaged before her marriage with Amalric. The church ruled that Amalric and Agnes' children were legitimate and preserved their place in the order of succession. Through her children Agnes would exert much influence in Jerusalem for almost 20 years.
The marriage of Amalric I of Jerusalem and Maria Comnena at Tyre in 1167, as depicted in a MS of the Histoire d'Outremer, painted in Paris c. 1295–1300. (Bibliothèque Municipale, Epinal).
During Baldwin III's reign, the County of Edessa, the first crusader state established during the First Crusade, was conquered by Zengi, the Turkic emir of Aleppo. Zengi united Aleppo, Mosul, and other cities of northern Syria, and intended to impose his control on Damascus in the south. The Second Crusade in 1148 had failed to conquer Damascus, which soon fell to Zengi's son Nur ad-Din. Jerusalem also lost influence to Byzantium in northern Syria when the Empire imposed its suzerainty over the Principality of Antioch. Jerusalem thus turned its attention to Egypt, where the Fatimid dynasty was suffering from a series of young caliphs and civil wars. The crusaders had wanted to conquer Egypt since the days of Baldwin I, who died during an expedition there. The capture of Ascalon by Baldwin III made the conquest of Egypt more feasible.[3]
Amalric led his first expedition into Egypt in 1163, claiming that the Fatimids had not paid the yearly tribute that had begun during the reign of Baldwin III. The vizier, Dirgham, had recently overthrown the vizier Shawar, and marched out to meet Amalric at Pelusium, but was defeated and forced to retreat to Bilbeis. The Egyptians then opened up the Nile dams and let the river flood, hoping to prevent Amalric from invading any further. Amalric returned home but Shawar fled to the court of Nur ad-Din, who sent his general Shirkuh to settle the dispute in 1164. In response Dirgham sought help from Amalric, but Shirkuh and Shawar arrived before Amalric could intervene and Dirgham was killed. Shawar, however, feared that Shirkuh would seize power for himself, and he too looked to Amalric for assistance. Amalric returned to Egypt in 1164 and besieged Shirkuh in Bilbeis until Shirkuh retreated to Damascus.
Amalric could not follow up on his success in Egypt because Nur ad-Din was active in Syria, having taken Bohemund III of Antioch and Raymond III of Tripoli prisoner at the Battle of Harim during Amalric's absence. Amalric rushed to take up the regency of Antioch and Tripoli and secured Bohemund's ransom in 1165 (Raymond remained in captivity until 1173). The year 1166 was relatively quiet, but Amalric sent envoys to the Byzantine Empire seeking an alliance and a Byzantine wife, and throughout the year had to deal with raids by Nur ad-Din, who captured Banias.
In 1167, Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt and Amalric once again followed him, establishing a camp near Cairo; Shawar again allied with Amalric and a treaty was signed with the caliph al-Adid himself. Shirkuh encamped on the opposite side of the Nile. After an indecisive battle, Amalric retreated to Cairo and Shirkuh marched north to capture Alexandria; Amalric followed and besieged Shirkuh there, aided by a Pisan fleet from Jerusalem.[4] Shirkuh negotiated for peace and Alexandria was handed over to Amalric. However, Amalric could not remain there indefinitely, and returned to Jerusalem after exacting an enormous tribute.
After his return to Jerusalem in 1167, Amalric married Maria Comnena, a great-grandniece of Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus. The negotiations had taken two years, mostly because Amalric insisted that Manuel return Antioch to Jerusalem. Once Amalric gave up on this point he was able to marry Maria in Tyre on August 29, 1167. During this time the queen dowager, Baldwin III's widow Theodora, eloped with her cousin Andronicus to Damascus, and Acre, which had been in her possession, reverted into the royal domain of Jerusalem. It was also around this time that William of Tyre was promoted to archdeacon of Tyre, and was recruited by Amalric to write a history of the kingdom.
In 1168 Amalric and Manuel negotiated an alliance against Egypt, and William of Tyre was among the ambassadors sent to Constantinople to finalize the treaty. Although Amalric still had a peace treaty with Shawar, Shawar was accused of attempting to ally with Nur ad-Din, and Amalric invaded. The Knights Hospitaller eagerly supported this invasion, while the Knights Templar refused to have any part in it. In October, without waiting for any Byzantine assistance (and in fact without even waiting for the ambassadors to return), Amalric invaded and seized Bilbeis. The inhabitants were either massacred or enslaved. Amalric then marched to Cairo, where Shawar offered Amalric two million pieces of gold. Meanwhile, Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt as well, and upon his arrival Amalric retreated.
In January 1169 Shirkuh had Shawar assassinated. Shirkuh became vizier, although he himself died in March, and was succeeded by his nephew Saladin. Amalric became alarmed and sent Frederick de la Roche, Archbishop of Tyre, to seek help from the kings and nobles of Europe, but no assistance was forthcoming. Later that year however a Byzantine fleet arrived, and in October Amalric launched yet another invasion and besieged Damietta by sea and by land. The siege was long and famine broke out in the Christian camp; the Byzantines and crusaders blamed each other for the failure, and a truce was signed with Saladin. Amalric returned home.
Now Jerusalem was surrounded by hostile enemies. In 1170 Saladin invaded Jerusalem and took the city of Eilat, severing Jerusalem's connection with the Red Sea. Saladin, who was set up as Vizier of Egypt, was declared Sultan in 1171 upon the death of the last Fatimid caliph. Saladin's rise to Sultan was an unexpected reprieve for Jerusalem, as Nur ad-Din was now preoccupied with reining in his powerful vassal. Nevertheless, in 1171 Amalric visited Constantinople himself and envoys were sent to the kings of Europe for a second time, but again no help was received. Over the next few years the kingdom was threatened not only by Saladin and Nur ad-Din, but also by the Hashshashin; in one episode, the Knights Templar murdered some Hashshashin envoys, leading to further disputes between Amalric and the Templars.
Nur ad-Din died in 1174, upon which Amalric immediately besieged Banias. On the way back after giving up the siege he fell ill from dysentery, which was ameliorated by doctors but turned into a fever in Jerusalem. William of Tyre explains that "after suffering intolerably from the fever for several days, he ordered physicians of the Greek, Syrian, and other nations noted for skill in diseases to be called and insisted that they give him some purgative remedy." Neither they nor Latin doctors could help, and he died on July 11, 1174.
Maria Comnena had borne Amalric two daughters: Isabella, who would eventually marry four husbands in turn and succeed as queen, was born in 1172; and a stillborn child some time later. On his deathbed Amalric bequeathed Nablus to Maria and Isabella, both of whom would retire there. The leprous child Baldwin IV succeeded his father and brought his mother Agnes of Courtenay (now married to her fourth husband) back to court.
William was a good friend of Amalric and described him in great detail. "He had a slight impediment in his speech, not serious enough to be considered as a defect but sufficient to render him incapable of ready eloquence. He was far better in counsel than in fluent or ornate speech." Like his brother Baldwin III, he was more of an academic than a warrior, who studied law and languages in his leisure time: "He was well skilled in the customary law by which the kingdom was governed – in fact, he was second to no one in this respect." He was probably responsible for an assize making all rear-vassals directly subject to the king and eligible to appear at the Haute Cour. Amalric had an enormous curiosity, and William was reportedly astonished to find Amalric questioning, during an illness, the resurrection of the body.[5] He especially enjoyed reading and being read to, spending long hours listening to William read early drafts of his history. He did not enjoy games or spectacles, although he liked to hunt. He was trusting of his officials, perhaps too trusting, and it seems that there were many among the population who despised him, although he refused to take any action against those who insulted him publicly.
He was tall and fairly handsome; "he had sparkling eyes of medium size; his nose, like that of his brother, was becomingly aquiline; his hair was blond and grew back somewhat from his forehead. A comely and very full beard covered his cheeks and chin. He had a way of laughing immoderately so that his entire body shook." He did not overeat or drink to excess, but his corpulence grew in his later years, decreasing his interest in military operations; according to William, he "was excessively fat, with breasts like those of a woman hanging down to his waist." Amalric was pious and attended mass every day, although he also "is said to have absconded himself without restraint to the sins of the flesh and to have seduced married women..." Despite his piety he taxed the clergy, which they naturally opposed.
As William says, "he was a man of wisdom and discretion, fully competent to hold the reins of government in the kingdom." He is considered the last of the "early" kings of Jerusalem, after whom there was no king able to save Jerusalem from its eventual collapse. Within a few years, Emperor Manuel died as well, and Saladin remained the only strong leader in the east.

I could see how that could be useful (adding a bug report page link), but i don't want to make the interface too cluttered. As for your second request. It currently says, can not find word, and has a more link which links to the page. that should probably be improved. thank you for the feedback. Bawolff ☺☻ 00:56, 21 October 2009 (UTC)
It now considers a hyphen as part of a word. However this introduces problems with hyphanated words that are really two words (example from your blog scientist-historians) . Ideally it should first check the entire thing, than try to see if just one part of the hyphanated word works. I don't know what you mean by non-hyphenated compound words.). - bawolff
Yeah, that would be very very hard to detect, I don't see any possible way of doing that. Bawolff ☺☻ 19:32, 25 October 2009 (UTC)
Well theoretically i could introduce some markup suchas: <span class="wiktTreatAsOneWord">sans serif</span>, but that seems kind of messy. I could also perhaps make it treat an under-score as a fake space, but thats also ugly. Bawolff ☺☻ 18:08, 26 October 2009 (UTC)
Firefox extension noscript may block scripts from en.wikinews, resulting in issues as pictured here. Solution: Have user whitelist wiktionary.org resolved this problem. - Amgine | t 21:48, 7 November 2009 (UTC)
I wouldn't really clasify this as a problem - if someone disables javascript, they should not be suprised when the javascript does not work. (the issue above would be blocking scripts from wiktionary (with either xslt defined as a script or having css disabled as well) - as if you had either en wikinews, or fr wikinews blocked, you would not be able to get to that step) Bawolff ☺☻ 22:09, 7 November 2009 (UTC)

There’s a scripture within the Bible from I Corinthians 13:8, that plain and simple states that love never fails. Well, if love never fails, how one thing our marriages are neglecting to the speed of approximately one inch every two in the usa? Something about our love definition doesn’t appear to complement those of the Bible. This information will take a look at love and marriage from a classical view. That tradition comes from the Bible. I’m going into this discussion having a thought that the Bible may be the truth and never wrong. When we can agree or perhaps think about the Bible is the Word of God (with regard to this discussion) then I have faith that we are able to arrived at may well conclusion in this region of affection and marriage.
Whenever we take a look at the west today, however state that they love one another, we’re increasingly more hard-pressed to locate love that really lasts. Have a trip right into a marriage and survive one, five, and maybe even ten years, but eventually there’s a require a divorce. That divorce can happen for a lot of reasons. Some reasons might be justified because of infidelity or even the abuse of the spouse or perhaps a child. However, more occasions these days, divorce appears to become rooted in certain vague catch phrase like irreconcilable variations. What’s that? What variations can not be reconciled if love is really present? Jesus mentioned it by doing this: “Love one another when i have loved you. Greater love doesn’t have one than this, he lay lower his existence for his buddies.”
Real love carries by using it a powerful commitment or even a sacrificial element. It has a sense that i’m within this relationship as much for the well-being like me in my own. If our love were based more about the romance that Jesus describes, maybe our love would truly last. Real love is non selfish, but we’ve attempted to define it as being selfish. But God’s type of love, as shown when Jesus died for all of us, works well and effective. Again, In my opinion the Bible to be real. Love never fails. But we fail whenever we prefer to get self-centered and just thinking about why is us happy. Maybe the answer is easy. We ought to just use the word love if we are prepared to commit and sacrifice with respect to another. I have faith that this could allow us to remain focused on a realistic look at a God type of love that’s much deeper and more powerful than we usually describe as love in a number of our marriages. I still think that the term holds true. Love never fails.

Koke is a versatile attacking midfielder and perhaps one of the best in the Spanish Primera Liga as well.

Tuesday Trap Time, albeit late. I'm not sure if fleshed-out traps just take a lot of space to cover adequately or if I just need to work on being less verbose when describing traps. I feel like I'm writing a stat block for a rules-heavy system or something… we'll see if I can get these more succinct as I continue this series, I suppose. In the meantime, at least this trap works.
Description: This trap can easily be placed in three situations. The first is your standard "I/ the bad guys that live in this dungeon want to make it dangerous for strangers to traipse about this dungeon." Not as fun as the other two options, in my opinion, because it doesn't make as much sense, seeing as this is an expensive and extra-deadly trap, but it'll work.
Situation two is to place this pit trap in the obvious path to some treasure. There may or may not be an easy way to walk around it.
Situation three is that this trap is placed in an NPC's lair. If confronted and unsure of victory, the NPC will flee via an escape passage (which may or may not be hidden by a tapestry, painting, bookshelf, false wall, etc.) which is thin enough to force anyone going through it to step on the top of this pit trap. The NPC should be lighter than your average PC.
The trap is situated in a place with a floor that is made of stone. Possible options include stone tiles, solid stone and irregular chunks of stone. The chances of noticing the trap should probably be higher if the floor is solid and continuous.
The pit has a lid that is a slab of stone that has been weakened on the underside. If the general floor is continuous, the edges of the slab may be camouflaged with dust; if the floor is made up of tiles, the lid is a tile. When sufficient pressure is put on the lid, it will break apart, dropping anyone on the lid into the pit. The fragments of the lid will be quite big and will contribute to the damage suffered by anyone who falls into the pit. The pit will only be triggered on a roll of 1 on a d6. If more than one character steps on the lid at a time, roll again each time a new character steps on the lid, increasing the chance of the trap being triggered by one, cumulatively.
If you keep track of your players' characters' encumbrance to the degree where you know how much your players' characters weigh, you can say that pressure below a certain weight will not trigger the trap, a certain range of weight will trigger the trap on 1/6 and pressure above a certain weight will trigger the trap on a 2/6, etc.
If you are running an NPC that uses this trap in an escape route, the NPC can automatically not trigger the trap at your option, depending on how competent your NPC is in designing and producing traps.
The trap is 10 feet/3 meters deep. A character that falls in will automatically take falling damage according to your system of choice's rules for falling damage (1d6 dmg suggested if your system doesn't include falling damage) and damage from the chunks of the lid falling on them (another 1d6 dmg).
There are spikes at the bottom of the pit with a distribution so that each character that falls in has a chance to be injured by three spikes. The spikes each hit at +2 (someone please correct me if that's an incorrect translation of a THAC0 of 18) and do 1d6 damage.
The spikes are also poisoned. Any character hurt by a spike must save against poison or take an additional 1d6 damage and begin to hallucinate. The player should not be informed that the character is hallucinating, but you should inform the player that the character is seeing strange things of your choosing at regular intervals. Ideally, these hallucinations should make safe situations seem absurdly dangerous and dangerous situations seem laughably safe. An example might be seeing a gelatinous cube slipping down a perfectly safe and empty stairway or seeing a contingent of benevolent demi-humans menacing an evil sorcerer who is in fact alone and able to devote all of her attention to fighting the PCs. These hallucinations should last for 1d4 game sessions and then go away as the poison works its way out of the character's system.
At the bottom of the pit, among the spikes, are broken wooden ladder rungs, a snake skeleton, the rotting, smeared remains of broken eggs, an ivory scroll case (covered in egg residue) and a cheap brass ring with the insignia of an ancient minor kingdom, a secret society in your setting, a favorite chariot racer, or something like that on it.
Detection/Disarming: This trap is difficult to detect, but not impossible. Ideally, the context of the trap will be the biggest clue that there may be a trap in the area; players should not expect that, for example, a treasure on conspicuous display in a room is not guarded by a trap of some sort.
Mere poking with a 10 foot pole will not reveal the presence of this trap, though a hollow sound may be produced if a 10 foot pole is thwacked against the lid instead of merely tapped. If large amounts of pressure are exerted against the lid, it will break according to the normal procedure outlined above. Other methods of detecting pit traps, like watching the behavior of liquid cast about the floor to check for the liquid dripping through seams of a lid, should generally work as makes sense to you. Reward efforts obviously meant to detect a pit trap.
The trap may also be detected passively if your particualar ruleset allows for that. This trap counts as stonework for the purpose of detection by a dwarf. At your option, you may modify the chances of detection to be poorer than normal, especially if the floor is tiled.
This trap may be disarmed by covering it with something that can support more weight than the lid can. It can also be rendered obvious by triggering it. If PCs are particularly zealous in their efforts, the trap could be filled with rubble to render it completely safe.
We've had a lot of great bloggers join the OSR blogosphere since Jeff Rients gave this sage advice on his blog last year, so I think it's a good idea to pass this around again. If you're a blogger, this button is a great thing to add to the bottom of each blog post; it lets readers print your post off or turn it into a PDF. I don't know how many great blog posts I've saved this way, and how many other great blog posts I've been frustrated to find I'd have to copy into a Word or Text document or lose track of. Please, give the OSR blogosphere a great Christmas present and make the stuff that you're already posting easily save-able for the rest of us. Thanks!
Humanity's historical record may be long but there is no doubt that Julian Assange and his small team have already changed the world. Throughout history courageous people who have taken risks to challenge power and the injustices of its abuse have suffered terrible personal consequences, for there is nothing more terrifying for the power elite than an educated, questioning and unified populace.
Tonight Australian time Julian Assange will ask the English High Court for leave to appeal two points of law to the Supreme Court. The judges who dismissed his appeal to the High Court will decide whether or not to certify these points, which must be of public importance and go beyond the specific facts of his case. If he fails he will be extradited to Sweden within 10 days and incarcerated.
Tonight a mother faces the prospect of her son being extradited to a country that has authorised Interpol to make a public Red Notice for her son  its highest alert  in the first and only case of its kind, a country that has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for rendering people to the CIA in breach of international law, and that doesn't have bail; of her son being held in Gothenburg Prison (which has been criticised by the European Commission against Torture for the way it treats its foreign prisoners), being tried in secret, without a jury, before a judge and two retired politicians from parties that have already criticised him, and ultimately being extradited to the United States at the behest of a government which has shown a thirst for revenge and has a long history of disregarding the rule of law and engaging, by its own hand or by proxy, in human rights abuses.
I took the opportunity to catch up with Christine Assange last week. In a lengthy interview I heard about Assange the man, the father, the brother and the son, told by his mother - a fierce supporter but also perhaps also his most honest critic - and not by a Palantir powerpoint presentation.
Seven days a week, she finds herself reviewing any legislative or other changes that occur in the United Kingdom, the United States or Australia designed to affect her son or his work. Australia's Wikileaks Amendment is a case in point. She responds to letters of support, prepares for and gives interviews to raise public awareness, writes notes and annotates articles. Time doesn't always permit sleep or the luxury of regular meals. Even if she's exhausted she limits her time off because it takes her longer to catch up. She does, however, take the time to listen every day to Pete Murray's song Free. Julian, she tells me, is into independent music from indigenous cultures from all around the world (although he had a soft spot for Kenny Rogers when he was a very young boy).
Her resources are limited. She's had the usual Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade line, "We're here if you need us", but support from the Gillard Government to date has been negligible. Recent events have underlined the Gillard Government's deference to the United States Government pursuit of Assange, like Foreign Affairs Minister Kevin Rudds tardy response to a letter from Gareth Pierce, one of Britain's high-profile human rights solicitors, the refusal to provide full and frank responses to all of Senator Ludlam's Questions on Notice, and ignoring calls that her sons life is in "clear and present danger".
"there is a concerted effort to nail himto shut Assange up If the legal attempt fails, he'll simply be assassinated by a CIA assassination team. It's common practice for the CIA to do that."
With calls by prominent United States political figures for her son to face the death penalty, it's little wonder that Christine Assange describes herself as being in "battle mode, where there's no room for emotion." She says she finds it "too difficult to engage her emotions." She has "good days and bad days ... I have a strong team and I know that my son is on the side of right so I have the moral strength to keep going." She speaks to her son regularly by phone, but they limit their conversations to generalities rather than the specific questions all mothers wants to ask their sons. Questions about his welfare or state of mind are off limits in case the conversations are being monitored.
She says that in the beginning her son had high hopes. "He believed that once people had the facts that would be enough. He had trust in the British legal system. He believed that the Australian Government would stand up for him. Sadly, the reality is quite different, and as a result he's currently caught between Sweden's domestic political agenda and the United States' agenda. .... He's dismayed at how far the corrupt will go to intimidate, or to collude with each other, or to go against the values of their own democracy." Even so, she says that "Although it's difficult, he is in good spirits that justice will be done."
Christine details how many in the media have continued to smear her son. She describes the Swedish documentary Julian Assange, Worlds Love Affair, which aired on Sweden National Television as the last in a documentary series about brutal dictators. She points out that "What is often forgotten is that he and his team provided the cables to the media for free. The media have benefited and made money as a result."
I asked her if she agrees with the description of her son being paranoid. Her response: "What is paranoia? It is an unfounded fear." His treatment so far, including the calls for his execution by people in positions of power, demonstrates that his fears are far from unfounded.
Responding to her son being criticised by some in the media as an "activist journalist", Christine is quick to point out that "everything you write and every thought you have is loaded with value judgement. Life is political. But I disagree that my son is an activist journalist because he doesn't blindly follow the left or the right. Wikileaks is a legitimate online publisher and my son is a legitimate editor-in-chief. My son and his team publish the material and people can draw their own conclusions from that. His work is based solely on publishing facts, not opinion. He and Wikileaks have stuck their necks out to report the truth, which is what journalism should be about. Wikileaks and my son have put their lives on the line. Instead of other journalists criticising them perhaps they should say, 'I wish I was that brave but I'm not'. We use the term "activist" in a derogatory way but if that means bringing the truth to the people then good, there should be more of it."
Assange has also been accused of narcissism. Christine's response: "They can't shoot the message so they discredit the messenger. They attack Julian personally and his personal funds have been frozen. There has never been an allegation that the cables published by Wikileaks are manufactured or untruthful. The content of the cables has not been denied by any country. Why isnt anyone in the media pushing to discredit the cables? No-one is perfect, Julian is human. He has been under enormous pressure. He is a CEO of an organisation where, if mistakes are made, there are considerable consequences for his sources. So the buck stops with him. He takes this obligation very seriously. How many journalists running to a deadline have not been snappy from time to time? Such comments about my son are petty in the extreme."
Accusations of narcissism don't seem to fit in with Assange's motives for starting Wikileaks. According to Christine, "Julian is actually a private person, believe it or not. The reason Wikileaks was started was to give whistleblowers in third world countries a way to speak out against dictators without fear of being gaoled or killed. Never in his wildest dreams did he ever expect to receive the US material."
From taxi-drivers to Vietnam veterans, no matter where Christine goes she receives messages of support for her son and Wikileaks. She has "not received one phone call telling me that my son has done the wrong thing". But she is yet to receive a phone call from Prime Minister Gillard. For her, she has this message:
"Be the leader everyone hoped you'd be. You could be a true leader if you stood up for freedom. Other countries which stood up to the United States are still trading with them. Nothing happened. David Lange stood up to bar nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed ships from using New Zealand ports or entering New Zealand waters and Canadas Pierre Trudeau opposed the Vietnam War and welcomed American draft dodgers. Who's dictating our foreign policy, the United States or you? And if you're a feminist then let's see it: let's see you be strong and tough by standing up for human and legal rights. If the ALP has lost its way then the new direction may be one of making Australian an independent democracy. You talk about our shared values with the United States, but which shared values are you talking about? Applying pressure in Haiti against moves to increase the minimum wage to $5 dollar a day? The handing over of citizen political dissidents in Iraq to the Iraqi secret police for torture? The persecution of whistleblowers? How do you want to be remembered? As the brave woman who stood up to a global bully, or the leader who cowardly coat-tailed or kowtowed to the global bully to pursue your own personal political ambitions?"
"Get informed. Inform a friend. Call talkback radio. Go and see your local Federal Member, regardless of their political party, and tell them you expect them to stick up for an Australian citizen, demand that they apply pressure to ensure that Julian is not extradited to the United States, and that they follow the diplomatic and legal advice provided in March this year to seek written humanitarian guarantees from Britain and Sweden, or you will change your vote at the next election."
Even if tonight's decision falls in her son's favour, she won't be rejoicing: it's just one battle of many she knows she will face. If he's unsuccessful she will stay focused on the next steps in what promises to be a long quest for justice for her son.
It's easy to see why, for some, Assange has become the ultimate prize. The information Wikileaks has published has given us a taste of how the power elite live and behave on their Laputa, their floating island hovering above the proles (that's us, the public). "Top secret" documents, which sit higher up the document classification ladder than the "confidential" and "secret" documents so far released by Wikileaks, must surely reveal the pure contempt in which the power players hold the rights of all citizens of all nations all around the world. In their quest to use Assange as an example to others who might stray from the "work hard and do as you're told" mantra, one wonders whether the powers that be might not take a step too far, perhaps underestimating the effect Assange and his small team have had on the proles attached with strings to their island.
I know no-one who wasn't outraged when they saw the US helicopter gunship murdering unarmed civilians in Iraq, and we have Assange to thank for telling the world that appalling truth. We mustn't forget that, just as we mustn't forget the importance for our own rights, and for the integrity of our country and ourselves as a people, of everything else Assange and Wikileaks have been trying to do. Just as our politicians and our Prime Minister mustnt forget their duty to an Australian in peril.
We live not in a world where "knowledge is power" so much as one where power abusers survive on deception and popular ignorance. That's exactly what Wikileaks' publishing aims to address: by getting things out in the open, and reporting honestly and accurately, people who are entrusted with power at least may be held accountable for what they do with it. A person like Julian Assange, who has the courage to act in the interests of each of us "little people", deserves our support  both individually and as a country - as the powerful try to close ranks around him. We must strive to see that he is treated justly and fairly, just as he has striven for that outcome for others.
Julian Assange, by exposing governments lies and hypocrisy, has saved more lives than he has endangered. He is hero and our government ought to be bloodywell ashamed of themselves for not supporting him.
I would like to hear your take on the human rights of the public servants operating secretly in other countries who were placed in danger by Julians' release of sensitive cables that identified them. And what about the 'little people' who are natives of these countries who were helping these operatives who are also outed because of it.
It seems a very well constructed sequence of events that has Assange where he currently sits. Too well constructed.
It's like reading a bad novel, devoid of subplot, other than those which take Assange to America, and the relentless pursuance of this single monotonous goal.
The dirge like timing of legal events acts to dissipate the deserved rage, and the real urgency for action, that is actually required to protect one of our citizens.
It's unfolding in slow motion, and we sit, lulled into inactivity. I would not be surprised if the US applies torpor as a tool of manipulation.
Another thing: Australia is not now the Australia it was ten years ago, and that apply to all other nation's too, of course. In ten years time from now same thing will happen.
Gee Ms Tranter, you make Sweden sound like some dark, regressive, authoritarian cess pool of all that is wrong with the world, instead of the progressive, social democratic country it is usually described as in these pages.
Well then was then. Not long time ago the general population was denied knowledge and today people are drowned in a Tsunami of knowledge and propaganda information. Actually, international news media is the biggest mass destruction weapon of all kind. Many world leaders join each other and are creating a separate nation of their own for them self. A new and secret constitution.
The establishment in the world could easy be our newest Gestapos without the general populations involvement.
Many awards. Much hype. No action. No seriously, what happened? Did Govt's fall? Troops withdrawn from IZ and AFG, Royal Commissions, people gaoled? Marching in the streets... Nope. Nothing much actually. Lot's of talk. Lot's of "extraordinary" and "amazing" and "greatest thing ever", but not much else.
The only person gaoled is poor ole Manning, who was hung out to dry, and the only people to suffer were translators and local contractors in AFG, who were named and summarily executed by the Taliban (something which Assange knew would happen but 'they are collaborators and deserve to die'. What a great bloke)
As a matter of fact, what most people got out of wikileaks is that the global diplomatic people do a pretty good job, sometimes things are covered up or marginalised and some countries do bad things. So what? Everyone knows this.
Wikileaks failed. It achieved nothing. It was easily deflected by all Western governments and all it did was promote Assange. And kill some AFG people. But who cares about them.
Well, a huge number of self-satisfied, moralising, opinionated, bourgeois wannabes got to feel righteous and smug. Without upsetting their government jobs or state supported super funds.
Wikileaks also showed that the diplomatic world saw Rudd labor as a dysfunctional madhouse, something the Australian media refused to report at the time.
There is nothing more terrifying than a questioning public? I don't agree there's nothing more terrifying than a public that believes everything that is said. That is truly frightening. The perfect example is Global Warming or Climate Change. Criticise Climate Change and Global Warming and see what happens, the names you are called, the nastiness that happens and some even lose their jobs and are not allowed to speak as has happened in NSW. Recently it has come to light a public servant in NSW disputed the level of sea level rise stating it has been only 1mm. He hasn't been allowed to speak and lost his position as a result. When the Climategate emails were released vested interests demanded that investigations should take place and the responsible people imprisoned for stealing and releasing that information. It seems that it is alright to release some information, steal some information and release it but not other information. Other information should be kept confidential especially that of climate scientists. I wondered why myself others didn't. Powerful forces do work to keep things quiet and like to criticise those who say different. I would have thought that it doesn't matter what one does. If you are alleged to have committed a crime that you should be given a fair trial and justice should be seen to have been done. I may not agree with the law of another country but if I go there I have to accept it. Assange went to a country where they have made a law as stupid as I may think it is I am sure that many women would not. I often hear about powerful groups in society not being held to account for their actions. Members of the legal profession are one of those groups. I am not surprised that one of those who think that they are above approach should demand that someone else be. Some might call it arrogance.
Irresponsible, reckless and sociopathic do not make for a suitable hero. Assange is all of these, in spades.
How could you possibly know whether this is true or not? I haven't seen him murder, rape, torture, pick fights, abuse drugs - have you? The US military, on the other hand
Unfortunately Assange wouldn't be the first person to have been involved with something great, that was personally a little grub. His whole personal credibility now rests on successfully resisting the extradition, so that he can maintain the self-important international conspiracy fantasy that he's using to evade the legal consequences, if any , of his actions.
If he's charged, convicted, and given a fine or a short jail sentence and left to get on with his life, he'll look like a self-absorbed ponce. Even worse if he's not charged, found not guilty, or given a suspended sentence.
It used to be the likes of Wilfred Burchett. But today, Julian Assange is the very epitome of the modern, left-leaning, "activist journalist".
Daniel Domscheit-Berg has claimed Julian Assange used to boast about how many children he had fathered across the world. Indeed, Wikileaks staff have been warned by Assange they would face $19 million in damages for passing on unauthorised information about wikileaks.
DF, no amount of awards puts anyone above the law. Support him by all means, but just not in evading the law. Send a nice card.
What the hell ? Going through a legitimate lengthy and costly appeal process is hardly evading the law. May I remind you that not only has he not been charged with anything he has had an electronic monitoring device strapped to his ankle for 365 days.
It's the world's governments that believe themselves to be above the law, as demonstrated by the illegal tactics employed against him.
Kellie, your article elucidates very well the inherent injustices in this case and properly justifies well-founded concerns for what lies ahead for Assange. However, it is what you don't address which leaves it somewhat wanting.
The problem for Assange, his mother, (tragically heartbreaking), yourself and all who blindly support him with uncritical fervour, is one of transparent naivete.
You wonder whether the powers that be are underestimating the "Assange effect". Paradoxically, they have done everything BUT underestimate it and that has put him where he is. It is Assange who has done the underestimating - he underestimated the magnitude of his actions. The establishment is concerned that a dangerous precedent has been set in the unauthorised releasing of classified information, no matter how innocuous the content was. It opens a potential floodgate, paving the way for others, others less responsible than Assange, others who will aspire to do likewise with no regard for political sensitivity, or potential threats to national security, etc. and is why the establishment cannot let it go uncensured. The potential for damage is spectacular. So, yes, you are right they ARE making an example of him, but I think with justification on the grounds of future potential risk.
Then: " ... we mustn't forget the importance for our own rights ... for the integrity of our country..." . That too can be turned against Assange. The establishment too is concerned for the integrity of the country - at pains to deter the potential for anyone to leak highly sensitive material, which could threaten the integrity of its military operations, the integrity of intelligence operations, etc.
You further say: "We live not in a world where 'knowledge is power' ... ". It is naive not to recognise the power of knowledge, particularly of classified knowledge in the wrong hands, the reason the establishment has acted and will continue to act against Assange with the utmost severity.
Finally, you say that Wikileaks' was: " ... reporting honestly and accurately, [so that] people who are entrusted with power ... may be held accountable for what they do with it." What is good for the gander is good for the goose. The establishment is demanding that Assange be accountable for what he did with that power - it works both ways. Assange published classified material with no authority to do so and is being held to account. It is the breach of that authority which has brought him undone. He was naive to imagine that it would not; naive to imagine that his own and Wikileaks' public profile would protect him. His egoism in believing he was larger than national security, larger than the importance of secure intelligence, together with an over-blown belief in his own self-importance have, sadly, been his undoing.
The most disgusting Assange critics are those who dress up their attacks as feigned concern for his well-being.
You speak of "the Establishment" and "national security". What do those words mean? Who are the faceless power-brokers who decide what's best for us and will not tolerate any dissent or even discussion?
These are the same people who decided it was in our "national interest" to invade Iraq, the same greedy fools who send our soldiers to help secure oil pipelines in Afghanistan, the fat swine who pillage global economies while our planet slowly dies.
Exactly right Gary Lord. Penelope Bell you are the one who is naive. Your comments are mis-informend and dangerous. Suggesting the government should disregard the rule of law and make an example of Assange shows how dangerous you are. And then you want to tell the author and us about rights. I agree with Gary, best for you to get out of the way.
Firstly, you presume to be able to speak for Assange. You say he underestimated his actions. How would you know his state of mind regarding his actions? Many authors / commentators who have interviewed Assange and written about him reveal that he was very aware of the potential magnitude of his actions - indeed having an impact is a core element in the design behind his actions.
Secondly, Assange has not done anything illegal. For you to suggest the government is justified in making an example of him is not only naive, but also stupid. To suggest the rule of law and presumption of innocence should not apply to Assange shows how dangerous people like you are.
Thirdly, you are encouraging our government to commit crimes against our citizens - what makes you think you are in a position to lecture others regarding our rights? Talk about naive. You also make the naive assumption that what ever the government decides should be classified is justified. Whistleblowers have always existed and democracy is stronger because they are willing to stand up and reveal the corrupt actions of those in power. It is naive people like you who presume to speak for others that are the real threat to democracy.
Penelope, what a load of mis-guided nonsense. Here you are presuming to know what Assange thinks, telling the author about human rights and promoting subjective opinion as though it is objective fact. It is you who are naive.
Penelope, I hate to let some facts get in the way of your self indulgent rant, but Assange/Wikileaks has done nothing illegal. To say the government is justified in making an example of him shows you are little better than the dictators and corrupt officials Assange exposes. Ever heard of the rule of law?
False - any publisher can publish leaked material. Every media organisation in the world relies on government leaks for stories. In a democracy we all have this "authority". Assange has broken no laws.
In general you seem to be saying that the accusations in Sweden are trumped up to protect the US establishment. This is precisely why this whole charade must be fought tooth and nail. People like yourself mouthed platitudes about their dear leader acting in their best interests as Hitler consolidated power. Many such people vanished from the face of the earth.
Many small minds attack the PM,why not attack an american newspaper magnate who deserted his own country,but will not support assange,perhaps murdoch and his lackeys want assange in america as a favour to those who do them favours.
Hilarious. (Nearly) every mother of a convicted rapist will say that "he is a good boy, he never raped his mother or his sisters, so far as I know"
- the evidence is hardly to be given much weight, and a lawyer should know better. Even one who is a human rights activist.
I think your take on this is extremely oversimplified. Julian Assange is now a man of power- because of the system he set up and because of his international fame. Does that mean he's automatically corrupt? Well, not necessarily. Are all of those who hold political or military power corrupt? Well, no. Are all those who hold and exercise power (including Assange) wonderful people with only the interests of the world at heart? Obviously no again.
Life is far more complicated than that and you can't just make simple distinctions between heroes and villains. In fact, one of the realities of life that few people seem to want to accept is that many of the bad things that have occurred in history have been done by people with good intentions.
I fear that the same could be said of Assange. His intentions are perhaps good but the method he is using is not simply trouble free. It may have some good short-term effects, in terms of bringing a few people to account, but it may also have some severely bad ones, especially in the long term. These include making governments even more overbearing or manipulative in their methods in order to more successfully control the flow of information.
On another note, I don't think the word 'render' means what you think it means. Maybe a little more research on that one would be helpful.
Is there something about the phrase "Australian Citizen" that our government, the Opposition and some of the posters here don't understand?
Julia Gillard you ad the balls to usurp Rudd,Have the balls to protect Assange as an Australian Citizen.
Indeed, the real whistleblower in this saga is still rotting naked in solitary confinement in a military prison in the USA.
In fact there was no mention of the whistleblower. His name is Bradley Manning, the US Army soldier who has been charged for revealing State information to an unauthorised person among other things.
The fact you don't like something for political reasons is not grounds to leak that thing to the media.
What's the difference between Julian & Julia? The letter 'n' of course. Both are doing their best to fix the world in their own ways and I applaud both for trying, which is more than what me and you are doing.
Julian is just one of the messengers, after all it was the Guardian & The New York Times that did the bulk of the publishing of US cables.
Why is Julian being punished for reporting on war crimes, double dealing & double speak? Shouldn't the real criminals be brought to bear?
All Julian's work has done is say the 'emperor has no clothes', this we already know so it's time the war profiteers put on some clothes & changed their behaviour, as that is what the bulk of peoples the World over wants.
So did I miss the bit where Christine is also Julian's harshest critic? I didn't see one word of criticism. Even defending him against a charge of narcissism leveled at him by his ex-colleagues at wikileaks. A 'legitimate editor-in-chief' would have edited the reports to protect the lives of people who chose to collaborate, or are they not worthy of any protection?
Get a grip. The data ran to tens of thousands of pages. Assange recruited into the release of the data and to help redact it major media groups. That proves his intentions to act responsibly and also deflects charges of aggrandisement since Wikileaks wasnt the sole distributor.
I see. There I was thinking a legitimate editor-in-chief would edit things legitimately and take responsibility. Instead he talked a confused and angry army boy into giving him all the info then dumped it on the newspapers for them to edit and unedited online for anyone to read. Tens of thousands of pages? You mean it was just too hard to bother with? Wiki was the primary source of all data.
You're trying a bit too hard to make him sound "illegitimate". Does every editor-in-chief on the planet edit every word in her/his publication? You're applying one standard to Assange and a completely different one to them.
There is absolutely no evidence for this whatsoever. Now, seeing as Manning has been subjected to both torture and punishment before trial (this is unconstitutional), even if they did torture a confession out of him it would not stand up in court.
Not true. There was a systematic redaction process employed. The only "illegitimate" , "irresponsible" one was David Leigh of The Guardian who published the decryption key to an archive.
There was a systematic policy of redacting names of informants in collaboration with media partners. The documents were released slowly, except when David Leigh of The Guardian decided to publish a decryption key to an archive. You can't blame WikiLeaks for that. The US Defense Secretary said previously that no harm had come to anyone due to the releases.
Nonsense. Assange only bothered to start removing names of collaborators once people realised how reckless he had been and huge pressure was put on him. It is highly likely people have been tortured and killed as a result of his actions.
The man is an anarchist with an enormous ego; I fail to see why he shouldnt face the consequences of his actions.
Wikileaks 'revealed' in 2011 that al-Qaeda has a cheap, portable and reliable device that can distribute cyanide gas. Like so many wikileaks cables it destroys the standard far left conspiracies. The Al-Qaeda threat is real. Cable after cable after cable show the US really is worried about militant Islam.
Cable after cable after cable show real Americans working diligently to combat AQ and build a stable Afghanistan.
But a coterie of lying far-left propagandists continues to trumpet the cables. Look! This is what we have been saying all along! They're careful to omit the details though.
Tranter comes to their aid. She's discovered the reason the grand conspiracy hasn't been corroborated by the cables. There another secret tranche that we haven't seen. Just imagine what's in those!
So we're asked to believe the cables demonstrate the existence of other cables which would prove the conspiracy - if only we could see them. This is the very definition of conspiracy theory.
What of the 'revelations'? Ron Suskind revealed the cyanide device in his 2006. David Finkel discussed the 'Collateral Murder' incident in detail in his 2009 'The Good Soldiers'. Unlike Assange he didn't omit key details.
'The Al-Qaeda threat is real. Cable after cable after cable show the US really is worried about militant Islam. '
This to me is how the US keeps folk like yourself in fear. It enables the fearful and angry side of the US to have a focus that is not within their country.
I'm not in fear. I think it was Al Gore who summed up my opinion. We should view terrorism like we view organised crime. An annoyance we can manage but never eliminate.
But you're missing the substance of my point. The cables show the threat is real. They refute the people who say the threat is invented. But those same people lie and claim coroboration from the cables.
And here's a subtlety for you. The US authorities didn't go to the media about the cyanide device (which they found in 2002). Suskind say this is because they didn't want to induce panic.
Suskind talks of a delicate balancing act. Politicians hype some threats for political reasons. Authorities and politicians reveal some threats for legitimate information purposes. Authorities hide some threats because they don't want to provoke fear.
As you imply, terrorism is a police and intelligence matter. The biggest liars are the military-industrial complex and their lackeys in politics who scored two major pump-priming exercises on false pretences. The IAEA has been stacked with yes men to engineer a war against Iran.
The Washington Post (I think it was) sat on that video for two years - why? WikiLeaks provided both raw and edited versions, so how can you say "Unlike Assange he didn't omit key details."?
My goodness, you love your Julian don't you? Reading about the truly awesome nastiness of the Swedish judicial system it seems like it is as bad as Iraq under Saddam.
Hold on though? Isn't this the same Sweden that used to be a model for the the lefty progressives? What can have happened? Don't they still have IKEA? Or is that the Danes?
My guess is that the only way that Julian can be held up to be a saint is for the Swedes to be portrayed as latter day Stalinists.
You should read a little more deeply how the Swedish legal system has handled this case before your spiteful little comments.
marcus: your exaggerated comparisons only serve to display your ignorance and highlight to others your lack of understanding regarding the issues.
I have lived in Sweden for the last seven years. I understand why people are skeptical when Julian Assange legal team says that Sweden is a dictatorial feminist country. After all it has a low crime rate, exceptional parent-leave entitlements, a humane welfare state and laws that protect the disadvantaged. One would assume that it smart and sophisticated.
Sweden however does have a cultural trait that would surprise most people. Swedes are generally know as people who are scared of conflict. Generally Swedes don't reject this definition. However there is a type of Swedish woman that reacts in a disproportionate passive aggressive manner who isn't scared of conflict.
If you wrong this type of Swedish woman then run to the hills - Julian Assange. They get this psychological dysfunction in their heads like a kid with ADHD. They can't focus on anything else except hunting you down until they hurt you as much as they can. Before you jump to the conclusion that I have some gender bias here, you should know that my Mother experienced such a woman on holiday here two years ago. It was so traumatic, my mother still cries when she thinks about it.
Unfortunately this type of woman is given the liberty to take their madness into the legal system. Paradoxically the cultural trait of being scared of conflict has allowed for the rise of those who aren't scared of conflict. That is why Julian Assange won't get a fair trail here.
Sweden, frequently cited as a paragon of social democratic progress is painted by Kellie, for the needs of this article, as some sort of Scandinavian Yemen.
Nor is Kellie's already wonky credibility enhanced by quoting Paul Craig Roberts as an authority. He is a hyperbolist (if there's no such word there should be) and believer in a 9/11 conspiracy. Of course he'd see a CIA assassination as a likelihood.
And it is this conspiratorial tosh that seems to be driving his reluctance to face the Swedish courts. On the face of it, our government has no more grounds to object to Assange facing the Swedish court than it had to object to Corby, or the recent 14 year old facing the courts in Bali.
sea mendez - talk about a sweeping generalisation. Regardless of whether you disagree with Assange theres no reason to make such ridiculous claims - its not like you at all!
I think you will find that Julian has upset alot of people by saying he doesn't have time for 911 skeptics, or words to that effect.
Aquila, I tend to agree with your post, what is there to to worry about facing a Swedish court...Sweden is no Yemen :)
Aquila: I live in Sweden. I think people like you find the realities of this world hard to cope with. To help you deal with your fears, you rationalise anything horible as a conspiracy dreamed up by crazy people and like to think of government as your protector, an institution that could never deceive you or commit crimes.
In relation to the US, I suggest you read the public records regarding Nixon and the crimes he committed, Vietnam and the pentagon papers, Senator McCarthy and his communist witch hunts etc. People like you said the same things about those issues at the time. It is your fear that allows corruption to happen, but the courage of people like Kellie and Julian will always be more persuasive.
He offered multiple times to attend a police station in Sweden with his lawyer, but this was rebuffed. He has offered to be questioned in Britain - this was also rebuffed. The Swedish Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and prosecutors have made prejudicial public statements about him that would be in contempt here. The police have continually leaked details to newspapers that have cast him in a bad light. The bench will consist of one judge and two political hacks. Sweden has a history of helping with extraordinary renditions. The Swedish Government has secretly signed up to NATO, which is unconstitutional, at the behest of the US Government. WikiLeaks exposed this. If you can't see that he has sound reasons for having a "reluctance to face the Swedish courts" then you must have government-approved blinkers on.
No one has explained to my satisfaction why Assange choose to edit out footage of armed men in the 'Collateral Murder' video. No one has explained to my satisfaction why he edited out the confused but substantial deliberations before the decision to shoot.
Assange apparently is committed to the truth. Why couldn't he trust us with these facts? Surely not because they weaken his charge of murder.
Not only did i see the armed men in the video, it was and is perfectly normal to be armed in the middle of a war-torn city.
There's a short edit and raw footage. The raw footage shows the armed men. To his credit he did release the raw footage. But why edit it in the first place?
Do you ask this of CNN or Fox when they dumb down vision to a few seconds? Organisations such as those often introduce blatant pro-US Government bias and never provide their raw video files.
Just watched it again. I'm was wrong. I agree you can see armed men. But the pre-amble text says some of the men 'appear' to have been armed. Not 'were' armed. Also we have handy arrows super-imposed on the footage pointing out cameras. No handy arrows designate weapons.
Elsewhere in the opening text the US military 'claimed' the victims died in battle. Well we know from David Finkel that the 2-16 battalion had been heavily engaged in the area. That's why they called the Apache in the first place. 'Claimed', I believe, robs the viewer of vital context. The Apache crew expected to find heavily armed and effective insurgents.
I still charge that the editing robs the viewer of context. Once you take out the loops and slow-mo and text you've got the raw 40 minutes condensed to less than 12 minutes.
The context, Sea Mendez, is that some un-named and faceless operatives somewhere in America killed some Reuters journalists and attacked a van full of civilians who stopped to assist the wounded thereby also shooting two childen. You can charge whatever you like and you can play with the story as much as you like but you can't change what happened and you're missing the point. The reason so many people were shocked and outraged was that the people who killed the journalists and civilians acted as if they were playing a video game. And most chilling of all, the US military refused to allow the children they had shot to be sent to an American hospital to be treated. Perhaps they thought that might be an admission of guilt. The fact is, if you look in a mirror and don't like what you see, it's futile and illogical to blame the mirror.
Having seen the whole video Mendez, I can say that none of these deliberations justify the murders. It seems that you think that they do?
This is a fight to protect US financial interests, at great expense to everyone, including Americans.
If there was a significant threat from Islamic terrorists, they would have made plenty of attacks on us by now.
Sure, there are a few whackos around, but remember we are more at risk from right wing gun heads representing the extreme side of politics inhabited by Mendez, Marcus, Aquila and others.
And the events of 9/11 are a conspiracy. Until someone can explain in detail how building 7 went down without explosives, it is an open question.
For the US to lift its popularity here and around the world, they need to release Manning, lay off Assange, get out of Afghanistan and Australian politics and properly investigate 9/11. And that's just for starters.
I don't think average Americans know how unpopular their leaders have made their country, which is a shame as most yanks are pretty decent people.
Christine Assange - as a mother I feel really very deeply for you! It amazes me that as an Australian we teach our children to stand up for their core values and beliefs to essentially live them and not to be afraid of consequences because you have to live a life that clearly demonstrates who you are - and living in a democracy its easier for us than those, as we've repeatedly witnessed, who do not live in a democracy. Well in theory anyway.
I think what is becoming more apparent is to what extent the US controls our governments left or right. It's depressing and oppressive. The message is we are just another state of the US with none of the rights so let the apathy continue and reign. I dont think Sweden will send him to the US they would be seen as a pariah state if they did. From what I also understand is that the majority of Swedes disagree with their government that they are ashamed by their actions.
Take heart too many people realise the multiple over reactions is in part expected of them to be seen to be outraged.
Until recently I was upset, even possibly angry that Australia followed the US traditions against what could be supposed disastrous consequences however, taking it further and playing it out I have changed my mind.
Out of all sides, even given the war on terror, whose side, apart from the US, would be an upgrade to our current existence? Whilst I often decry what they do to others in our name, who would be better at giving us some kind of future. In the big picture, the USA is our friend and, although I don't agree with many of the regimes policies, they really are still our best chance of us having a future.
Take away the religious nutters, which is slowly happening anyway, and it will be a future we could all look forward to.
For some reason, some people choose to overlook this. The USA is far, far, far from perfect, and has done some truly terrible things. But, what country is any better ?. What form of government is better then an imperfect Western democracy ?. What superpower has ever been 'better' : The Roman Empire, Colonial Britain, Imperial Japan, the USSR, modern China ?. What country does not put it's own self interest first ?. How many countries have freedom of speech, religion, etc.?
We are right to criticise our own government, and the US government on many things they do, but let's not forget the big picture, and at least be grateful we CAN criticise them. Many people around the world don't have this 'right'.
Nothing to do with crocodiles, take away the religious nutters (Bush, Howard & Blair were religious nutters too) and I could even respect western democracy ideals.
Do I want Islamic or Catholic rule? No F'ing way! Can I get this freedom to be me anywhere else? No f'ing way!
Power & might have nothing to do with my observations, it's our way of life that I think can't be topped. I can stand up & say I think the war on terror is f*cked without fear of being gutted in the streets.
I believe democracy & capitalism is the best system (though not this corporatism crap we're being forced to swallow) because it gives us a reason to try harder whilst giving everyone a vote in the system. Things may get hairy at times but 'right' always wins in the end.
bushranga - I understand that people like to feel comfortable with what is familiar - after all life is becoming more intense.
I am one of those people that welcome change life is dynamic not stilted and by welcoming inclusion of many more perspectives we all benefit in the long term. The way the world is we seem to be contracted into a world dominated framework an Us v Them polemic that alienates many peoples voices. By accepting that the US dominate the narrative and speaks for me upsets me because its a false premise and IMO the reason why even Americans themselves feel alienated in their own country.
Our PM has no trouble talking to a detained brat in Bali, but fails to contact someone who's making a positive difference in this world.
Of course, she is a complete coward. She has refused every invitation to appear on the Bolt Report. I assume that's who you are talking about.
you're kidding right?! the measure of a prime minister's performance is not which hateful sensationalist television slander shows she does or does not appear on.
In comparison, Gillard continued to call Assange a criminal even after the AFP advised he had not committed any offence.
PM Gillard did not say he was a criminal. She said the documents he was disseminating were sourced illegally. Not a big Gillard fan but let's not get media-hype confused with reality.
These chest-thumping US politicians and their ilk should be reminded that, once opened, the door of assassination can swing both ways. It should be made clear to them that the price for killing an Australian citizen might be one they aren't personally willing to pay.
Do you serioulsy think that "US politicians" are organising an assassination attempt on Jules? You've been watching too many John Travolta movies.
Ah, the US carries out assassinations every day. Mostly theyre unknown arabs so probably doesnt register on your cracked morality radar.
Even a cursory glance would provide you with an abundance of verbatim quotes by US politicians and presidential candidates calling for this action.
If they're willing to kill their own citizens in targeted assassinations, why is this so difficult for you to understand?
The US President has the power to order the assassination (via drone) of any US citizen or perceived enemy of the US anywhere in the world. Without proof and obviously without trial. The US President has the gall to use the word 'Justice'.
Gillard is too enthralled by Obama to stand up for Assange, regardless of how much pressure is exerted upon local members on this issue. The only way for Australia to support Assange is to remove Gillard, and replace her with a leader that is not a US puppet.
Thanks Julian & co for Wikileaks, for revealing the ugly ugly truths that the rich and powerful want to hide. Kudo's Christine for keeping the fight going here in Aus.
Shame Julia Gillard, shame on the many other weak politicians and gutless journalists only too willing to serve the evil that Wikileaks exposes.
There are sexual assault charges against him. If there is enough evidence to support the charges, then he should be extradited to Sweden to answer to them. This should be done under proper process, with presumed innocence and with full adherence to his legal and human rights
As for the "Top secret documents which... must surely reveal the pure contempt in which the power players hold the rights of all citizens of all nations all around the world." I'm sorry but that is just ridiculous.
For the record, I'm a left leaning supporter of human rights and hysterical rants like this do nothing to support the cause.
Christie: You should make an effort to understand the facts before commenting. Firstly, Assange has not been charged. Secondly, in Sweden these trials are held in secret without a jury. Supporting that process is hardly supporting human rights. Third, fear pushes people like you to side with power and attack those perceived as less powerful. Julian Assange has incredible courage, he has done us all a great favour. If you are unable to recognise this or at least willing to make an effort to understand the facts, then I suggest it's best for you not to get involved by promoting mis-information.
" ... in Sweden these trials are held in secret without a jury. Supporting that process is hardly supporting human rights."
What a load of codswhalop. We have closed hearings here in certain circumstances. Do you think that Assange won't have legal Counsel representing him looking out for his interests; that the proceedings won't be recorded verbatim? Any miscarriage of justice will be on the record, there for the entire judiciary and legal system to challenge, including his own team of lawyers.
Closed hearings in sexual misconduct cases are progessive - isn't that what leftist luddites pride themselves on being? Their purpose is to prevent the 'dirty linen' of all involved from being dragged through the mud by unscrupulous and insensitive media masochists. If you were up on a rape charge, I am sure you would be grateful for that, rather than all and sundry knowing the size of your penis and when, where and how it went.
Penelope Bell: Once again your ignorance is on display for all to see. The Australian Constitution gaurantees our citizens the right to trial by jury. That's a strong statement regarding the way we view the rights of our citizens. Allowing two ex-politicians to determine the outcome instead of a jury made up of citizens is hardly progressive.
Penelope Bell, how is it progressive to have two ex-politicians determine the outcome of court proceedings? Do you understand the notion of seperation of powers and the role it plays in a democracy?
Penelope, your comments show you have an inflated view of your own opinion and ignore many relevant facts. Please stop flattering yourself.
There are NO charges against him at this point. He has been asked to answer questions, nothing more. He has offered to answer those questions in Great Britain, but this offer was declined.
Anna Ardin has never asked the police to bring charges of any form against Assange, she simply asked them if Assange's failure to use protection during consensual sex without her knowledge was an offence. In any other country this is not a crime (unless an individual knowingly exposes the other party to HIV, which is not the case here). The act was consensual, no harm was done and it remains unclear if the incident is even within the parameters & spirit the Swedish legislation was designed to protect, let alone warrant a trial or penalty of any form.
Matters of sexual assault are a highly serious matter, however this whole situation risks diminishing the seriousness of the physical and psychological trauma experienced by true victims of assault.
You seem to know all the facts, including each participants STD status. With promiscuous people who can be sure from one encounter to the next?
Agreed in so far as it seems the whole case hinges on whether or not the second copulation - when Ardin was approached by Assange in her sleep - will be deemed 'consensual' or not, as it was at that time that he had unprotected intercourse with her, aware that she had not agreed to that on the previous occasion. She will have to present some evidence of resistance, I should imagine, once she realised he was not wearing any protection.
Either way, it demonstrates sleezy and dubious moral principles on his part, with a complete disrespect for the female's rights.
No, this rant is necessary to keep up awareness - hopefully you have realised your lack of awareness of something that any self respecting human rights supporter should know about.
I am also saddened not only by our own government washing their hands of him but also by the ease with which the normally strongly independent UK judiciary has been subverted to the serve the US government's wishes in this case, the whole thing stinks to high heaven!
Maybe, but only time will tell I suppose, I still say it's on the nose; why Sweden...very convenient. Like I said we'll see.
I think I met Julian many years ago and we promised to each other(we were young then) that we would change the world to make it a better more peaceful place. We argued which roads to take and said our farewells.
While John Howard, George Bush and Tony Blair remain free and unpunished for the crimes they committed by illegally invading and destroying millions of lives in Iraq we cannot trust any of the countries whose governments promoted and supported that crime.
Julian Assange and Bradley Manning are heroes and will be remembered as such, not so the people and governments who want to victimise them in order to 'save face' or make a political killing in order to show how politically ethical they are.
Christine Assange needs all the support she can get, she is brave and articulate and just in what she says.
Is he the bloke who is looking at a REAL death sentence for treason? That's as opposed to the other chap who is up for some sort of sexual misconduct charge.
I notice Ms Tranter didn't mention the Bradley chap at all. Julian is supposed to have risked everything and is therefore a true saint but all he really did was dump Bradley's files onto the server. What a hero he is?
Julian is under loose house arrest at one of his welthy chum's mansions and Bradley whatshisname is under close confinement looking at a potential lethal injection. Poor Julian!!
Wikileaks tried to provide a lawyer to Manning straight away, but the government refused to allow it. Your moral slippery slope re: his torture is scary - somehow because Manning has suffered horribly (and unconstitutionally) it's all right for Assange to "only" be punished by a year's detention when he has not even been charged.
No one who knows about the Wikileaks saga forgets Bradley Manning. He did a brave thing for the benefit of humanity.
Julian Assange is also doing brave things for humanity. He is the public face of an organisation seriously antagonising the powers that be.
There's no mileage in hailing Bradley a hero. No warm and fuzzy bleeding-heart feelings invoked. No public interest in a poor, misguided mis-fit of a kid, who couldn't get it together and risked all, never to be spoken of, seen or heard from again, so why should anyone care - least of all the media - the champions of the underdog.
Penelope Bell: You presume to speak for others, which shows your arrogance and how naive you really are. Bradley Manning has strengthened democracy, if you lack the ability to see how, then best if you don't comment.
Everyone seems to be wilfully missing the point; he's in trouble for alleged sexual offences, nothing to do with Wikileaks. But then the left has a habit of excusing its heros of such offences, take Roman Polanski for example.
Secondly, sexual assault has a hell of a lot to do with it - it is what Assange is charged with. Sweden has far greater independence from the US than the UK does (yes, the UK, like Australia, South Africa and other commonwealth countries, has a strong tradition of the rule of law, but just as the history of the UK, South Africa, Australia etc shows, that is no guarantee of civil freedoms).
All of the measures that the author is complaining about - hearing in front of judge alone in rape cases, lack of bail for sex offenders, exclusion of the media from rape cases - have all been won from the long-fought campaigns of feminists, seeking to reduce the infamous psychological scarring suffered by victims of rape during the trial process. Many victims of rape describe the trial as being akin to being 'raped all over again'. The measures that Tranter complains about were all hard-won rights that feminist and anti-rape groups sought in order to make it easier for women to report and prosecute rape.
I'm not saying that they are necessarily correct. But as someone with considerable experience as a criminal lawyer in Australia, I can say that I have never met a SINGLE lawyer in Australia who is completely happy with the way that prosecution and hearings of sexual assault trials occur in Australia, and most inquiries into the matter have suggested some combination of the measures adopted by Sweden.
It is true that one of the alleged offences would be a minor offence in Britain, and is ALSO only a minor offence (a fine, akin to a driving offence) in Sweden. The other one is actually straight-up rape, and if the victim's story is true then he would be easily convicted of rape in Britain, or Australia for that matter.
I applaud the actions of wikileaks and Bradley Manning, and of Assange in contributing to them. But wikileaks is not just one man. Moreover, people are complex - I have seen FAR too many rapists walk free because the defence shows that they have done truly wonderful work for the community. The sad truth is, that sex offenders can come from any walk of life - they might be the greatest artist of our era, they might dedicate their whole lives to charity and they might be someone who strikes a blow for information and the public good over government control.
Too many people cannot understand this, and so let rapists walk free, blaming the victim for blackening the name of such a distinguished individual. Sure, admire Assange's work, but let that stand as reason to mitigate his sentence when tried and if convicted.
Almost ALL rapes involve a man's word against a woman's word. That's because they occur in private. Don't blame the victim for being in the same situtation as most rape victims everywhere.
Calling what Julian is accused of rape is degrading to anybody that has truly been raped. It demeans the term and trivialises the horror of a real rape. The term rape (and its connotations) should be reserved for the horrific event it is when it does occur or we risk that we all take the term for granted.
Are you aware of the treaty between Sweden and the US that gives the US first crack at an accused? It allows for virtually no judicial review in Sweden. Britain is starting to more strongly resist its one-sided extradition treaty with the US. There are noises in the Parliament to amend it. In comparison, extradition from Sweden is a fait accompli.
The only charge he is facing is for various sexual misconducts. Otherwise he is free to come and go as he pleases. Free as a bird. Unlike his patsy Bradley.
He has not even been charged with anything! This is sickeningly unjust. Manning is not a patsy - the WikiLeaks submission system makes it impossible to trace who has submitted any documents.
Assange is in trouble for sleeping with women whom allegedly bragged about their encounters, and then cried rape.
Everyone has a habit of excusing their heros of such offences. The only difference is the left makes a great show of pretending they don't.
Their attitude to the Assange allegations has been vile and short-sighted. Wait their dispicable back peddling when the alleged is a right wing politician.
The two women involved both admit they had consensual sex with assange. Both bragged about the encounter through text message in one case and twitter in the other.
It has everything to do with Wikileaks! The sexual assault charges, which may or may not be genuine (we may never know), are being used to "secure" Julian so the US can get their hands on him. And then it won't be about the sexual assault charges, will it?
I'm sure the US has no interest in his crimes allegedly committed in Sweden. If (when?) he is shipped off to the US in a little red bow from Sweden, there is no doubt he will be tried for other manufactured "crimes" and murdered extra-judicially. The US has probably THE WORST record of human rights abuses and continues to act against the principles their country was founded upon.
Sure you can evaluate and analyse and even consider their art great but you don't care what sort of human beings they are and what damage they might have caused other human beings?
Trekka, Samantha Geimer excused Polanski for his offences. Is she one of 'the Left' too? http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/07/roman-polanski-victim-director-is-not-a-threat-prosecution-should-end.html
And how about that well-known lefty, Margaret Thatcher, excusing General Pinochet for his offences? http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/304516.stm
It is not in her remit to forgive him, its simply illegal to rape 13 year old girls no matter what they think about it at the time or latter. Look at the comments, makes my point, still forgiving him in the name of art, unbelievable.
The worlds leaders better correct the course or face another revolution led by China to have their model of communist rule On so called developed and developing democratic nations.
The more virtuous your deed the more it will be attacked by the crass that have risen to the surface.
It may have been a little easier to obtain the documents than the Pentagon Papers, but they were essentially a report not a dossier.
Unlike Ellsberg, Assange never stole anything. All he did was publish it in association with newspapers that disowned him in a cowardly manner.
Even Ellsberg also gave up on the NYT which finally only published the Pentagon Papers because if they refused them they were still going to be published and hence their refusal would look cowardly.
The fourth estate is guilty of both envy and cowardice in their collective reluctance to support someone who has revivified the act of journalism.
To know that our Chinese-speaking Foreign Minister is nudging his American colleagues to war against China, if necessary, is something that it is important to know for our survival, and is anything else more importatnt.
You should also have taken the opportunity to catch up with the facts of the case Kellie. He's only wanted for questioning in Sweden. There's no warrant out for his arrest, nor has he been charged with any offence, but your third paragraph has him being extradited to the US in the blink of a jaundiced eye.
I didn't get past the third paragraph; it didn't seem worth the time. You've declared where your interests lie and your interests doesn't interest me.
One question though: if Assange is so confident he has no case to answer on the rape accusations why is he burning up so much effort and money trying to avoid his day in a Swedish court?
"One question though: if Assange is so confident he has no case to answer on the rape accusations why is he burning up so much effort and money trying to avoid his day in a Swedish court?"
If you'd bothered to read the article, instead of proudly waving the flag of your ignorance from the battlements, you'd know the answer.
As Ms Tranter observed, Sweden "has been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for rendering people to the CIA in breach of international law ..."
If you'd bothered to read my comment, instead of proudly waving the flag of your rudeness from the battlements, you'd know that I stopped reading the article after paragraph three.
Paragraph three contains a lot of colourful suggestions and allegations, including your quote about Sweden "rendering people to the CIA". Sweden did that once, in 2001, and ended up paying one of the people rendered $500,000 compensation. It's hardly likely that Sweden would allow Assange to disappear from its jurisdiction in such a high-profile case as this.
Your poster boy, who incidentally is well known for not having a fixed abode, has been asked to answer questions in a sexual assault allegation. He doesn't seem to be prepared to provide the answers on Swedish soil.
"Your poster boy, who incidentally is well known for not having a fixed abode, has been asked to answer questions in a sexual assault allegation. He doesn't seem to be prepared to provide the answers on Swedish soil."
Not having a fixed abode? Tsk, tsk, tsk. Is there no end to his perfidy? Assange went voluntarily to the Swedish police, twice, and stayed around for forty days. The police told him they had no interest in arresting him. The original public prosecutor dropped the case like a hot potato and said he had no case to answer. Only when a politician got involved - a politician who as Minister for Justice was involved in 'rendering' asylum seekers to the CIA who sent them to Egypt where they were tortured, did that change. This politician got the ball rolling again.
It's also more than a little strange that after Assange went to the police for a second time and was interviewed by them, prior to leaving Sweden for Britain, the website of the Public Prosecutor's office waited until he had left Sweden to announce that Assange was being charged in his absence with rape, giving the impression that he was a criminal on the run. And however you want to spin all this you can't change the fact that the politician who insisted the case be re-opened is the man who rendered those men to the CIA, knowing they would be tortured. And what woman who has been raped boasts about having the man in question in her bed and calls him and his friends, in a tweet, 'the coolest people on the planet'? What woman who has been raped throws a big party for the man in question the next day? Once the 'rape' stories were being thrown around the tweets were removed. The rape allegations have still, after a year, not led to charges and it's obvious they are only a holding tactic to keep Assange where they can see him while they try to get a grand jury indictment for espionage up in America. It's hard to see how that charge will ever stick since the First Amendment protects freedom of the press and freedom of speech. It's a political witchhunt. His enemies know it is, but they also suspect they can't make anything stick in court on espionage charges. Thus the 'rape' allegations to both blacken his name and keep him under house arrest, uncharged with anything while they think of something to charge him with.
If they can extradite him to Sweden for questioning, then why is it so unbelievable they will extradite him to the U.S, also for 'questioning'.
The only thing that could possibly amount to rape in this case is the accusation that he deliberately broke a condom. The woman admits she did not see this, and only infers it. The same woman still allowed him to sleep in the same house, did not make a complaint for several days and in fact bragged about it on twitter.
I would suggest that his fears of the powers that be are entirely justified. What would you do to avoid facing court or questioning in a foreign country if you knew you were innocent? Much the same as Julian Assange most likely.
This is so obviously a witch hunt, why don't they just come to England and quesiton him, Aus govt must act on this
The Citizens often called: En Svensk Tiger translated to A Swedish Tiger, and meaning; Swedes remains silent and shut-up.
Sorry. I don't buy it. Perhaps if it was just the interview without the heavily one sided opinion piece it was wrapped in; but no, I had trouble keeping on after the third, paranoid, conspiratorial paragraph. Did you intentionally mean to not include the bit about why he is potentially heading to Sweden in the first place? You know, the 'R' word?
Oddly enough, the Swedes haven't laid rape charges against him. They say that they only want to interview him.
But, if they only want to question him, surely it would be cheaper to fly two prosecutors or policeman to London than to pay (invariably expensive) lawyers to chase him through the courts?
Would he have to talk to Swedish prosecutors if they came to visit him in the UK? Just a question. I think not.
At multiple points when he was in Sweden, his lawyer offered that he would answer questions at a police stations. These offers were turned down. Ditto when he was back in Britain. The legal system is being abused for political ends.
Actually you are wrong there. He has already spoken to the Swedes, and would do so again if they came to the UK.
This whole "rape" case in Sweden was resolved until the Bradley Manning thing, and then all of a sudden it became good politics in Sweden to re open the "investigation".
He also made himself available for several days whilst still in Sweden to speak to the prosecutor. The prosecutor declined the offer.
Even if you believed (falsely) that he was unwilling to talk to the Swedes in the UK, how does extraditing him to Sweden increase the chances of him talking?
The only possible reason for the extradition is to remove him from the public eye, into Sweden's closed door courts, a locked cell and then a bundling to the US for further secret 'justice'.
And the real criminals in this are the Australian Government, who have abandoned one of our citizens due to pressure from another nation.
I think Kellie Tranter's article is a well argued one and I continue to fear for the safety of Julian Assange.
Members of the US Congress have openly called for Assange to be assassinated. Given Sweden's history of supporting illegal renditions to the USA, this should be sufficient cause.
As the Swedish Prime Minister already, a half a year ago, publicly to the world media described Julian Assange to be the: "Peoples Enemy Number One", what do you think his government appointed/issued Judge and Jury shall say, to not lose their position's or face?
Something similar was said by the Australian PM the very same point in time and during court procedures.
Christine Assange is up there with Terry Hicks in the pantheon of parents who stood with their kids when the going got tough. I admire them both and am appalled at the continuing failure of our political "leaders" Gillard and Abbott to support an Australian citizen in dire straits. Quite a different outcome when a 14 yo acts stupidly in Bali - because obviously big brother USA was not upset by that.
But the rendition of Hicks to Guantanamo gives us legitimate concern that the USA will stop at nothing to silence Julian Assange. And the Swedish Government is as bad as ours in its keenness to curry favour.
Is truly sickening that we have such a pathetic bunch of moral cowards deciding the truth is inconvenient to their collective mouths in the trough operations.
Regardless of what you think about Assange, the way that various governments, Australia's most of all, has been viscious, cowardly and dishonest.
"there is nothing more terrifying for the power elite than an educated, questioning and unified populace"
Well they're not likely to be to worried at the moment then. Of the three things listed, questioning is the only one that's getting a little bit of a work out. And even that is fairly superficial, more akin to complaining really.
"For the rest of us, she asks mainly that we speak up" That's a bit of an ask for a bunch of sheep. It's been a long time since "Animal Farm" but the parallel of the powerfull with their snouts in the trough while the sheep get fleeced or slaughtered seems about right.
"Just as our politicians and our Prime Minister mustn't forget their duty to an Australian in peril."
Assange deserves our support? Is that a joke? He wasn't elected. He isn't part of the traditional media. He didn't have a history of community activism prior to starting wikileaks. Who is this guy again? Can anyone tell me exactly what he does with money donated to wikileaks? If not then he's no better than a Nigerian lottery scam artist.
They came for Bradley Manning and I did nothing. They came for Julian Assange and I did nothing. By the time they came for me there was no one left to do anything. Wake up _robert. Send not to ask for whom the bell tolls - it tolls for all of us and for democracy and freedom of information and freedom of speech. Your comparison of Assange with a Nigerian lottery scam artist is beneath contempt and makes it clear that you just don't understand what's going on or what's at stake.
The fact that he isn't elected and isn't part of the traditional media is what gives him credibility since both these branches of civil society have lost all credibility by their cowardice and deceit and their addiction to right wing agendas instead of the truth.
John, the Swedish police have had every opportunity to go to London and question him. Instead they want to extradite him. The normal method of questioning is to issue a summons. An Interpol Red Notice for somebody who has not been charged with any crime is highly unusual.
And Sweden has a very different definition of rape to the rest of the world. If you have consensual sex and the condom breaks, under Swedish law that is rape. That would not be a crime anywhere else.
John - It was my understanding that the woman who was making this claim refused to sign it and walked out. The Prosecutor decided to proceed regardless. It is also my understandint that if in Australia someone made a claim of this type and decided not to proceed with it - it would not be acted on by the police. My point is why? I think we all know the answer to that.
Any excuse to string him up? That issue had been covered ad-nauseum. If you need to pick on something largely irrelevant to the whole picture, then your nose may be the handiest place to start at...
I was actually thinking of John Donne and Niemoller, atomou, but Hemingway fits as well. Donne also wrote that 'no man is an island'. The people who criticize Assange as if HE'S their enemy always forget that, if they ever knew it. His fate is ours if the present direction of western society continues on its wayward path. Once you criminalize freedom of speech and freedom of information and turn the justice system into a weapon of political revenge you don't have to be too clever to work out that Big Brother has won.
What amazes me also is that mainstream media who are run by 'very rich people' are fine by govts regardless of their personal agendered propaganda but as soon as someone who delivers volumes of free info on the NET its declared as theft a massive threat to all humankind.
The fact he isn't elected means he has no right to make decisions on the confidentiality of documents or information.
So what? It also means he has no obligation to keep the secrets of a foreign government either. Power relies on attitudes like yours.
Daniel Ellsberg wasn't elected either but he still decided that he couldn't allow Nixon and the Pentagon to go on lying about the Vietnam War. When the case went to court, a case for which he could have been sentenced to life in prison, the judge decided that the public had a right to know what Ellsberg wanted to tell them, he threw the case out and Ellsberg walked free. The public has a right to know what Assange wants to tell them too. And if the media won't tell them, as was the case with Ellsberg too, then someone who can tell them has to do it, even at great risk to themselves. If people like Ellsberg and Assange didn't exist at certain points in human history, someone would have to invent them.
"It seems to me", said Debs, "that if it were not for the resistance to degrading conditions, the tendency of our whole civilization would be downward. After a while, we would reach the point where there would be no resistance and slavery would come".
This is precisely the situation of democracy and freedom of speech at this time in history and only a very gullible person would believe that the Pentagon and the American elite want to protect either. Needless to say I see the rape charges as part of a political witchhunt to silence Assange and Wikileaks, and most people with a sense of justice see them the same way.
In an article where the opening sentence is that Assange and his team have changed the world, I would have expected some mention of what that change is.
I think the only change will be that governments will be even more careful about keeping their secrets secret !
I'd prefer that governments would be more careful and honest, not acting like rogue traders behind our backs.
I don't see any change - Changing the world is a very difficult thing to do and very few people have done that. I would love for someone to explain to me how Julian Assange changed the world. Assuming isn't a very good thing to do...you know what they say about people who assume....
Sarah - maybe the ultimate change will be that people all over the world have since Wikileaks realised that all is not futile everyone can extend their values their sense of right and wrong into the public sphere and be heard that the current recipe is 'power corrupts power' - that everyone can have a voice no matter how big or small the ramifications.
Sarah, have you heard of the Arab Sring, or maybe you've heard of the Occupy movement. These are based on citizens getting information previously secreted by their despots
Actually the occupy movement started due to high unemployment rates and big banks being bailed out. At least these are the two most cited reasons - and both were not found out due to wikileaks. Another cited reason is corporatism, which was already a well known occurence before wikileaks. Therefore, instead of stating to me 'have you heard of the arab spring and occupy', you actually have to draw a connection between wikileaks and those two events, rather than just stating that there is one, considering that is very thing that i disagree with. Now i would love you to show me how the arab spring and occupy would not have occured if it was not for julian assange.
Sarah: I am part of the occupy movement and the courage of Julian Assange inspired me and the information he revealed about corrupt corporations, banks and government informed my deision to be part of the occupy movement. Assange made information regarding the corruption accessible and available to many people. The trouble with people like you is you are just like the corporstions, you want to tell others what they think and believe your subjective opinion is an objective fact.
Rest assured, VoR, if he hadn't changed the world, he wouldn't have been so vigorously pursued -and feared- by the most crass criminals of the world.
And I do think it is a bit of a stretch calling the Swedish government the most crass criminals in the world. Crass would be more a description of how Assange has talked about his accusers.
STDs like AIDS which even when controlled by anti-viral causes dementia and organ failure in 50 year olds. Or HPV which is the cause of every case of cervical cancer. Or Chlymidia or ghonorea which in women can cause fatal PID and infertility.
Promiscuity is a risk factor. The nmore partners you have or your partner has they greater the risk. Not using condoms is a risk factor.
Are you suggesting that only J Assange was promiscuous? There are any number of interpretations that could be made on the statements available in the press - any press - yes, a valid fear of STD's is one, as is a petulant reaction to discovering you weren't the 'only' one. Until ALL sides of the story are fully tested and made public, in their entirety, such myriad versions of events will continue to proliferate. Even after all information is diseminated, there will still be objections raised to whatever the outcome is.
I'm not suggesting anyone was promiscuous. I am suggesting the women (given what they knew) could reasonably suspect he was promiscuous. What was it? Two partners in 24 hours (I might be wrong)?This probably contributed to their 'tizzy'.
If you are really concerned about testing the allegations you should attend to commentors here that have declared Assange innocent (or those that have declared the Apache pilots guilty of murder). I have no opinion as to Assange's guilt or innocence. I can't have because I haven't seen the evidence.
No, no charges, VoR! This is the crass criminals' MO. No official charges until they've got you inside their slimy fingers. Then, no one hears about either you or their charges. People will see a lot of sickening lies about you in the media: you are a terrorist, a rapist, a baby molester, a mass murderer... and your govn't -Oz, UK, (well maybe not the UK as badly) and the US will go to sleep on you.
These crass criminals have a long history of exactly such an MO. One could begin looking at some of the chapters of this history in, say, Geoff. Robertson's "The Justice Game."
If it is a terrible flaw in their system then it should be fixed, but it's way out of my expertise to even form an opinion on whether it IS a flaw.
But one of the findings of the British Court which recently upheld the extradition is that the actions of which he is accused are offences under British law as well as Swedish law. I'd like to see him brought to account for them.
The argument that the Swedish legal system is so heavily flawed that no-one accused of a crime there should be brought to account doesn't work for me.
Then we're left with the argument that Assange is so special because of his involvement with Wikileaks that he should be above the law, and that doesn't work for me either.
one shoots the messenger to deter others from delivering his word. others will, nonetheless, strive to deliver the message. at the cost of their love and lives. I believe the contest is ultimately pointless, interim sheer, bloody hell. the bells of hell go ding-aling-aling. 'Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.'
Thank you Kellie Tranter for this essay. Assange has been attacked brutally for daring to expose to public gaze the machinations of the powerful elite in world politics. That was long overdue.
I'm very sad that Sweden, a country I love and have visited many times, has retreated to the neo-fascist stance it took in WWII when it was scarcely neutral. My Swedish friends say as much.
Julia Gillard should do her best as PM to protect an Australian citizen from the efforts of US extremists, who wish to do him harm, to have him rendered into their clutches. He embarrassed the, by daring to expose their inadequacies.
Julian Assange is indeed being persecuted for standing up and revealing government's dirty secrets. For nothing else. Yes all governments have secrets and I don't agree all should be open slather. But I applaud revealing lies and humanitarian outrages such as Wikileaks and its brave people have done. Thank you!
I have many friends in Sweden, a place I also visited many times. Whilst I am not a rapist suspect, I wouldn't set foot there again exposed to draconian, over-the-top laws. Sweden was said to be a neutral country, something that has been compromised due to US heavy handed pressure now.
Sorry to Matt, Barbaro, Sakari, Nono, Janne and the rest - you'll have to visit me here from now on - if Gillard and Obama permits...

At the rate the Obama Administration is going, it may rival the Nixon Administration in its cover-ups and dishonesty. The new revelation that at least nine attorneys in the Justice Department have previously defended accused jihad terrorist follows closely after another incident remarkably similar in broad outline: the Rashad Hussain debacle. Both feature the Obama Administration apparently turning a blind eye to sympathy for jihad terrorists, followed by clumsy attempts to cover up its indifference once the whole thing came to light.
Rashad Hussain is the young man Obama appointed as special envoy to the 56-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference, only to discover that several years ago Hussain decried as a “persecution” the prosecution of admitted Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Sami al-Arian. This was disturbing enough in itself, but less so than the clumsy cover-up that followed, in which Hussain attempted to whitewash the record of his statements about al-Arian by having the magazine in which they appeared alter its online archive. Did the White House know Hussain was doing this? Did it approve of his action? We don’t know, because Obama’s ever-helpful lapdog, the mainstream media, is not asking.
Now comes the latest indication that the Obama Administration’s commitment to doing something effective about the recent increase in jihad terrorist activity in the U.S. is sadly lacking. In the wake of the Fort Hood massacre, the Christmas day underwear bomber, and several other foiled jihad terror attacks on American soil, it has now come to light that at least nine former advocates for accused jihad terrorists are working in the Justice Department to prosecute those same terrorists and their comrades-in-arms.
And contrary — yet again — to Obama’s campaign promise of transparency, the Holder Justice Department so far has released the names of only three of them. These include Tony West, the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division, who once defended the Marin County Mujahid, American Taliban John Walker Lindh, a convert to Islam who was captured in Afghanistan in 2002, fighting alongside the Taliban and Al-Qaeda against American troops; and Neal Katyal, Principal Deputy Solicitor General, who defended Osama bin Laden’s driver, Salim Ahmed Hamdan. If Holder thinks that he can safely reveal that the Justice Department is now the place of employ for the defenders of one of the foremost American jihadists and one of Osama bin Laden’s personal lieutenants, what is he concealing?
Even aside from the secrecy, however, the fact that any of these attorneys would be working in the Justice Department is bad enough. Everyone is entitled to legal representation, but no attorney is “entitled” to work in the Justice Department, and few – none of these included – should be entrusted to devise or implement policy regarding terrorist prisoners.
One wonders just how committed these nine legal eagles will be to prosecuting people from the same group as those whom they were so recently defending.
Would the Justice Department under Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1942 have hired lawyers who defended Nazis? Would Holder’s Justice Department have hired Lynne Stewart, the lawyer who defended the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the Blind Sheikh, Omar Abdel Rahman, before she was sent to prison for helping the Blind Sheikh pass messages to his fellow jihadists outside the prison walls? Do Obama and Holder really not see that the nine lawyers may be looking out for the defense of their former clients and their jihadist coreligionists, rather than trying to make sure they are adequately prosecuted? Or do they just not care?
In a letter to Holder last Friday, the seven Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee complained that when they inquired about these attorneys, the Justice Department’s response was “at best nonresponsive and, at worst, intentionally evasive.”
Why the cover-up? Now in both the Rashad Hussain incident and the strange half-admissions about the Justice Department, the Obama Administration has once again reinforced the impression that it is more interested in winning brownie points in the Islamic world by apologizing for jihad terrorism and treating jihadists with kid gloves than it is in protecting the American people from those jihadists. We deserve better.
Throughout her long and blemished public career, Hillary has always blamed her troubles on bad people conspiring against her.

If it were to become an extension, it would essentially be an extension that just loaded a script. (which i geuss there is nothing wrong with, some people might find that easier to install). However the issue with translatewiki, which well very appealing, the translation doesn't just involve translating a few key phrases, it also involves modifying some rather complicated (And quite fragile) regexs that screen scrape wiktionary, since each language definition uses slightly different markup. This requires some technical knowladge, beyond simply translating words. Bawolff ☺☻ 19:51, 12 November 2009 (UTC)
Accents at begin and end of words are legal in many languages. For example, on French wikibooks, when I click on "désactivé" word, I get "Could not retrieve definition of desactiv".
The error message is translated (I could [have] sworn that was translated. must be losing my mind. Its translated now, just needs to be posted to fr wiktionary.). When I click on the word, I get "(Français) Du verbe désactiver." [17] The issue with accents at the end of the word was fixed weeks ago. Perhaps you have an old (really old) cached version of the script. Try doing a hard refresh of the page where you clicked the word. Apperently this is a different issue with accents (Its caused by their being extra whitespace at the end of the word that was not stripped properly). If you do a hard refresh it should be fixed now.

On another hand, it showed one way the sister projects could coordinate trans-project, and in that it was a great success. - Amgine | t 14:18, 25 June 2017 (UTC)
Because there is a try/catch, usually the script should silently fail, but in some scenarios the script still breaks and stops execution of all the next scripts…

@Od1n: I was under the impression this gadget has not worked for years, not just since late 2016. See the preceding thread. --Pi zero (talk) 12:25, 7 July 2017 (UTC)
Unmaintained is not quite the same as completely broken; I understand most of it still works on some of the wikis it is enabled on. - Amgine | t 14:17, 7 July 2017 (UTC)
We encountered a strange issue on fr.wiki, when using importStylesheet() was kind of making ineffective the try/catch of this externally loaded gadget, thus encountering the reported fatal error and breaking all the next scripts. This really has to be fixed.
@Od1n:: Because no one on en.WN is maintaining this script, I would suggest you copy the script to fr.WP and make the changes you see as necessary to fix it. You will likely also need the xslt. I believe JackPotte could be helpful in maintaining the xslt. - Amgine | t 15:37, 7 July 2017 (UTC)

The "Deutschlandlied" (English: "Song of Germany", German pronunciation: [ˈdɔʏtʃlantˌliːt]; officially titled "Das Lied der Deutschen", or "The Song of the Germans"), or part of it, has been the national anthem of Germany since 1922. In East Germany, the national anthem was "Auferstanden aus Ruinen" ("Risen from Ruins") between 1949 and 1990.
Since World War II and the fall of Nazi Germany, only the third stanza has been used as the national anthem. The stanza's beginning, "Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit" ("Unity and Justice and Freedom") is considered the unofficial national motto of Germany,[1] and is inscribed on modern German Army belt buckles and the rims of some German coins.
The music is the hymn "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser", written in 1797 by the Austrian composer Joseph Haydn as an anthem for the birthday of Francis II, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and later of Austria. In 1841, the German linguist and poet August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote the lyrics of "Das Lied der Deutschen" as a new text for that music, counterposing the national unification of Germany to the eulogy of a monarch, lyrics that were considered revolutionary at the time. Along with the flag of Germany, which first appeared in its essentially "modern" form in 1778; it was one of the symbols of the March Revolution of 1848.
In order to endorse its republican and liberal tradition, the song was chosen as the national anthem of Germany in 1922, during the Weimar Republic. West Germany adopted the "Deutschlandlied" as its official national anthem in 1952 for similar reasons, with only the third stanza sung on official occasions. Upon German reunification in 1990, only the third stanza was confirmed as the national anthem.
The song is also well known by the beginning and refrain of the first stanza, "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles" ("Germany, Germany above all else"), but this has never been its title. The line "Germany, Germany above all else" meant that the most important goal of 19th-century German liberal revolutionaries should be a unified Germany which would overcome loyalties to the local kingdoms, principalities, duchies and palatines (Kleinstaaterei) of then-fragmented Germany.[2]
The melody of the "Deutschlandlied" was written by Joseph Haydn in 1797 to provide music to the poem "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser" ("God save Franz the Emperor") by Lorenz Leopold Haschka. The song was a birthday anthem honouring Francis II (1768–1835), Habsburg emperor, and was intended as a parallel to Great Britain's "God Save the King". Haydn's work is sometimes called the "Emperor's Hymn."
It has been conjectured that Haydn took the first four measures of the melody from a Croatian folk song.[3] This hypothesis has never achieved unanimous agreement; the alternative theory reverses the direction of transmission, positing that Haydn's melody was adapted as a folk tune. For further discussion see Haydn and folk music.
Haydn later used the hymn as the basis for the second movement (poco adagio cantabile) of his Opus 76 No. 3, a string quartet, often called the "Emperor" or "Kaiser" quartet.
The Holy Roman Empire, stemming from the Middle Ages, was already disintegrating when the French Revolution and the ensuing Napoleonic Wars altered the political map of Central Europe. However, hopes for the Enlightenment, human rights and republican government after Napoleon's defeat in 1815 were dashed when the Congress of Vienna reinstated many small German principalities. In addition, with the Carlsbad Decrees of 1819, Austrian Chancellor Klemens von Metternich and his secret police enforced censorship, mainly in universities, to keep a watch on the activities of teachers and students, whom he held responsible for the spread of radical liberalist ideas. Since reactionaries among the monarchs were the main adversaries, demands for freedom of the press and other liberal rights were most often uttered in connection with the demand for a united Germany, even though many revolutionaries-to-be had different opinions about whether a republic or a constitutional monarchy would be the best solution for Germany.
The German Confederation (Deutscher Bund 1815–1866) was a loose federation of 35 monarchical states and four republican free cities, with a Federal Assembly in Frankfurt. They began to remove internal customs barriers during the Industrial Revolution, and the German Customs Union (Zollverein) was formed among the majority of the states in 1834. In 1840 Hoffmann wrote a song about the Zollverein, also to Haydn's melody, in which he praised the free trade of German goods which brought Germans and Germany closer.[4]
After the 1848 March Revolution, the German Confederation handed over its authority to the Frankfurt Parliament. For a short period in the late 1840s, Germany was economically united with the borders described in the anthem, and a democratic constitution was being drafted, and with the black-red-gold flag representing it. However, after 1849 the two largest German monarchies, Prussia and Austria, put an end to this liberal movement toward national unification.
August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote the text in 1841 on holiday on the North Sea island of Heligoland, then a possession of the United Kingdom (now part of Germany)[5].
Hoffmann von Fallersleben intended "Das Lied der Deutschen" to be sung to Haydn's tune, as the first publication of the poem included the music. The first line, "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, über alles in der Welt" (usually translated into English as "Germany, Germany above all else, above all else in the world"), was an appeal to the various German monarchs to give the creation of a united Germany a higher priority than the independence of their small states. In the third stanza, with a call for "Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit" (unity and justice and freedom), Hoffmann expressed his desire for a united and free Germany where the rule of law, not monarchical arbitrariness, would prevail.[6]
In the era after the Congress of Vienna, influenced by Metternich and his secret police, Hoffmann's text had a distinctly revolutionary and at the same time liberal connotation, since the appeal for a united Germany was most often made in connection with demands for freedom of the press and other civil rights. Its implication that loyalty to a larger Germany should replace loyalty to one's local sovereign was then a revolutionary idea.
The year after he wrote "Das Deutschlandlied", Hoffmann lost his job as a librarian and professor in Breslau, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland), because of this and other revolutionary works, and was forced into hiding until being pardoned after the revolutions of 1848 in the German states.
The melody of the "Deutschlandlied" was originally written by Joseph Haydn in 1797 to provide music to the poem "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser" ("God save Franz the Emperor") by Lorenz Leopold Haschka. The song was a birthday anthem to Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor of the House of Habsburg, and was intended to rival in merit the British "God Save the King".
After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, "Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser" became the official anthem of the emperor of the Austrian Empire. After the death of Francis II new lyrics were composed in 1854, Gott erhalte, Gott beschütze, that mentioned the Emperor, but not by name. With those new lyrics, the song continued to be the anthem of Imperial Austria and later of Austria-Hungary. Austrian monarchists continued to use this anthem after 1918 in the hope of restoring the monarchy. The adoption of the Austrian anthem's melody by Germany in 1922 was not opposed by Austria.
"Das Lied der Deutschen" was not played at an official ceremony until Germany and the United Kingdom had agreed on the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty in 1890, when it appeared only appropriate to sing it at the ceremony on the now officially German island of Heligoland. During the time of the German Empire it became one of the most widely known patriotic songs.
The song became very popular after the 1914 Battle of Langemarck during World War I, when, supposedly, several German regiments, consisting mostly of students no older than 20, attacked the British lines on the Western front singing the song, suffering heavy casualties. They are buried in the Langemark German war cemetery in Belgium. The official report of the army embellished the event as one of young German soldiers heroically sacrificing their lives for the Fatherland. In reality the untrained troops were sent out to attack the British trenches and were mown down by machine guns and rifle fire. This report, also known as the "Langemarck Myth", was printed on the first page in newspapers all over Germany. It is doubtful whether the soldiers would have sung the song in the first place: carrying heavy equipment, they might have found it difficult to run at high speed toward enemy lines while singing the slow song. Nonetheless, the story was widely repeated.[7]
The melody used by the "Deutschlandlied" was still in use as the anthem of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until its demise in 1918. On 11 August 1922, German President Friedrich Ebert, a Social Democrat, made the Deutschlandlied the official German national anthem. In 1919 the black, red and gold tricolour, the colours of the 19th century liberal revolutionaries advocated by the political left and centre, was adopted (rather than the previous black, white and red of Imperial Germany). Thus, in a political trade-off, the conservative right was granted a nationalistic anthem – though Ebert advocated using only the anthem's third stanza (which was done after World War II).[8]
During the Nazi era, only the first stanza was used, followed by the SA song "Horst-Wessel-Lied".[9] It was played at occasions of great national significance such as the opening of the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin when Hitler and his entourage, along with Olympic officials, walked into the stadium amid a chorus of three thousand Germans singing "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles". In this way, the first verse of the song became closely identified with the Nazi regime.[10]
After its founding in 1949, West Germany did not have a national anthem for official events for some years, despite the growing need for the purpose of diplomatic procedures. In lieu of an official national anthem, popular German songs such as the Trizonesien-Song, a carnival song mocking the occupying Allied powers, were used at some sporting events. Different musical compositions were discussed or used, such as the fourth movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which is a musical setting of Friedrich Schiller's poem "An die Freude" ("Ode to Joy"). Though the black, red and gold colours of the national flag had been incorporated into Article 22 of the (West) German constitution, a national anthem was not specified. On 29 April 1952, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer asked President Theodor Heuss in a letter to accept "Das Lied der Deutschen" as the national anthem, with only the third stanza being sung on official occasions. President Heuss agreed to this on 2 May 1952. This exchange of letters was published in the Bulletin of the Federal Government. Since it was viewed as the traditional right of the President as head of state to set the symbols of the state, the "Deutschlandlied" thus became the national anthem.[11]
Meanwhile, East Germany adopted its own national anthem, "Auferstanden aus Ruinen" ("Risen from Ruins"). As the lyrics of this anthem called for "Germany, united Fatherland", they were no longer officially used, from about 1972,[12] after the DDR abandoned its goal of uniting Germany under communism. With slight adaptations, the lyrics of "Auferstanden aus Ruinen" can be sung to the melody of the "Deutschlandlied" and vice versa.
In the 1974 FIFA World Cup in their home country, West German football players remained silent and did not sing their anthem.[13]
In the 1970s and 80s, efforts were made by conservatives in Germany to reclaim all three stanzas for the anthem. The Christian Democratic Union of Baden-Württemberg, for instance, attempted twice (in 1985 and 1986) to require German high school students to study all three stanzas, and in 1989 CDU politician Christean Wagner [de] decreed that all high school students in Hesse were to memorise the three stanzas.[14]
On 7 March 1990, months before reunification, the Federal Constitutional Court declared only the third stanza of Hoffmann's poem to be legally protected as a national anthem under German penitential law; Section 90a of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) makes defamation of the national anthem a crime – but does not specify what the national anthem is.[15] (This did not mean that stanzas one and two were not – at that time – part of the anthem at all, but that their peculiar status as "part of the anthem but unsung" disqualified them for penal law protection because the penal law must be interpreted in the narrowest manner possible, and was not explicit in their regard.)
In November 1991, President Richard von Weizsäcker and Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed in an exchange of letters to declare the third stanza alone to be the national anthem of the reunified republic.[16] Hence, effective since then, the national anthem of Germany is unmistakably the third stanza of the Deutschlandlied, and only this stanza, with Haydn's music.
The opening line of the third stanza, "Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit" ("Unity and Justice and Freedom"), is widely considered to be the national motto of Germany, although it was never officially proclaimed as such. It appears on Bundeswehr soldiers' belt buckles (replacing the earlier "Gott mit uns" ("God with Us") of the Imperial German Army and the Nazi-era Wehrmacht). "Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit" appeared on the rim of 2 and 5 Deutsche Mark coins and is present on 2 Euro coins minted in Germany.
German linguistic area (green) and political boundaries around 1841 (grey) in comparison to the text’s geographic references (bold blue)
The first verse, which is no longer part of the national anthem and is not sung on official occasions, names three rivers and one strait – the Meuse (Maas in German), Adige (Etsch) and Neman (Memel) Rivers and the Little Belt strait – as the boundaries of the German Sprachbund. As the song was written before German unification, there was never an intention to deliniate borders of Germany as a nation-state. Nevertheless, these geographical references have been variously criticized as irredentist or misleading.[17] Of these the Meuse and the Adige were parts of the German Confederation during the time when the song was composed. The Belt (strait) and the Neman later became actual boundaries of Germany (the Belt until 1920, the Neman until 1945), whereas the Meuse and Adige were not parts of the German Reich as of 1871. Today, no part of any of the four places mentioned in the "Deutschlandlied" lies in Germany.
In an ethnic sense, none of these places formed a distinct ethnic border. The Duchy of Schleswig (to which the Belt refers) was inhabited by both Germans and Danes, with the Danes forming a clear majority near the strait. Around the Adige there was a mix of German, Venetian and Gallo-Italian speakers, and the area around the Neman was not homogeneously German, but also accommodated Lithuanians. The Meuse (if taken as referencing the Duchy of Limburg, nominally part of the German Confederation for 28 years due to the political consequences of the Belgian Revolution), was ethnically Dutch with few Germans.
Nevertheless, such nationalistic rhetoric was relatively common in 19th-century public discourse. For example: Georg Herwegh in his poem "The German Fleet" (1841),[18] gives the Germans as the people "between the Po and the Sund (Øresund)," and in 1832 Philipp Jakob Siebenpfeiffer, a noted journalist, declared at the Hambach Festival that he considered all "between the Alps and the North Sea" to be Deutschtum.[19]
Despite the text and tune of the song being quite peaceful compared to some other national anthems, the song has frequently been criticised for its generally nationalistic tone, the immodest geographic definition of Germany given in the first stanza, and the alleged male-chauvinistic attitude in the second stanza.[20][21] A relatively early critic was Friedrich Nietzsche, who called the grandiose claim in the first stanza ("Deutschland über alles") "die blödsinnigste Parole der Welt" (the most idiotic slogan in the world), and in Thus Spoke Zarathustra said, "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles – I fear that was the end of German philosophy."[20] The pacifist Kurt Tucholsky was also negative about the song, and in 1929 published a photo book sarcastically titled Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, criticising right-wing groups in Germany.
German grammar distinguishes between über alles, i.e. above all else [for me], and über allen, meaning "above everyone else." However, the latter misleading translation was chosen by the Allies during both World Wars for propaganda purposes.[22]
German president Theodor Heuss, upon request from chancellor Konrad Adenauer, declared the Lied der Deutschen the national anthem of the German Federal Republic in May 1952, along with the provision that only the third verse was to be sung at official occasions.[11] The declaration was a compromise between Heuss, who wanted to retain only the third verse, and the Cabinet's wish to keep the first two verses. As a result, the Lied (implicitly in its entirety) was declared the national anthem, with the provision that the third verse would have precedence.[11] As described above, this changed in 1991; since that date, the first and second stanza are no longer "part of the anthem but unsung officially", but nothing more (or less) than stanzas of a song written by a German poet to a well-known tune which people may well sing if they wish (the idea which is sometimes encountered that they have been forbidden is wrong), but without any official status at all.
In 1977, German pop singer Heino produced a record of the song, including all three verses, for use in primary schools in Baden-Württemberg. The inclusion of the first two verses was met with criticism at the time.[23] After German reunification in 1990, the German national anthem was redefined as the third verse of the song only.[24]
The first two verses are therefore no longer part of the national anthem, and the performance of the first verse in some cases has been portrayed as controversial.
In 2009, Pete Doherty was supposed to sing the German national anthem live on radio at Bayerischer Rundfunk in Munich. As he sang the first verse, he was booed by the audience.[25] Three days later Doherty's spokesperson declared that the singer was "not aware of the historical background and regrets the misunderstanding". A spokesperson for Bayerischer Rundfunk welcomed the response, stating that otherwise further cooperation with Doherty would not have been possible.[26]
When the first verse was played as the German national anthem at the canoe sprint world championships in Hungary in August 2011, German athletes were reportedly "appalled".[27] Eurosport, under the headline of 'Nazi anthem', erroneously reported that "the first stanza of the piece [was] banned in 1952."[28]
Similarly, in 2017 the first verse was mistakenly sung by Will Kimble, a U.S. soloist, during the welcome ceremony of the Fed Cup tennis match between Andrea Petkovic (Germany) and Alison Riske (U.S.) at the Center Court in Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii. In an unsuccessful attempt to drown out the soloist, German tennis players and fans started to sing the third verse instead.[29]
Hoffmann von Fallersleben also intended the text to be used as a drinking song; the second stanza's toast to German wine, women and song are typical of this genre.[30] The original Heligoland manuscript included a variant ending of the third stanza for such occasions:
An alternative version called "Kinderhymne" (Children's Hymn) was written by Bertolt Brecht shortly after his return from American exile to a war-ravaged, bankrupt and geographically smaller Germany at the end of World War II and set to music by Hanns Eisler in the same year. It gained some currency after the 1990 unification of Germany, with a number of prominent Germans opting for his "antihymn" to be made official:[31]
Max Reger quotes the tune in the final section of his organ pieces Sieben Stücke, Op. 145, composed in 1915/16 when it was a patriotic song but not yet a national anthem.
The German musician Nico sometimes performed the national anthem at concerts and dedicated it to militant Andreas Baader, leader of the Red Army Faction.[32] She included a version of "Das Lied der Deutschen" on her 1974 album The End.... In 2006, the Slovenian "industrial" band Laibach incorporated Hoffmann's lyrics in a song titled "Germania", on the album Volk, which contains fourteen songs with adaptations of national anthems.[33][34]

Getting Mother’s Body (pub. May, 2003; ISBN 1400060222) is the title of a novel by 2002 Pulitzer Prize winning author Suzan-Lori Parks, a terrific piece of literature in which Parks weaves one family’s greed, desparation and general distrust into a vivid patchwork quilt of fiction.
The story finds its setting in Ector County, Texas, during middle twentieth century America. Enter Billy Beede knocked-up and unmarried, she’s just one facet of a down-on-its-luck, cynical, and perhaps downright dysfunctional “negro” family, which includes, amongst a cast of others, Billy’s one-legged Aunt June, disillusioned minister Uncle Teddy, and Dill, the apparent “bulldagger, dyke, lezzy, what-have-you” one-time lover of her momma Willa Mae, a former blues and lounge singer.
With little time and money to her name, Billy attempts to save up money to get an abortion. Try as she might, however, the time begins to disappear far quicker than the money appears. Everything changes, though, when a letter arrives from a distant relative in La Junta, Arizona, announcing that the plot of land where Willa Mae, is buried is about to be plowed over to build a shopping center. If she isn’t retrieved, she’ll simply be paved over.
Meanwhile, in the years following Willa Mae’s death, unsubstantiated rumours that she was buried with a veritable collection of jewels had been fairly well-known but rarely discussed. It isn’t long before the wheels start to turn in Billy’s head, however, and soon thereafter, unspoken deeds from the past and an all-around malaise of rapaciousness set in, resulting in a “winner-take-all” rally across the wastelands of the midwest to claim the bounty.
Getting Mother’s Body is a fantastically written book full of dry, quirky humour and sardonic wit amidst the vague canvases of racist west Texas. Each chapter is titled after a specific character from the book, whereupon the reader sees the adventure through said character’s perspective in a way that is not choppy, and does not detract from the storyline. Willa Mae herself has chapters from beyond the grave which consist of haunting, soulful lyrics.
In the end, Ms. Parks’ Getting Mother’s Body is a highly-recommended change of pace for any reader, regardless of race or persuasion. If this, her first novel, is any indication, however, it won’t be the last time we are treated to such an adventure.
Shattered Glass is the title of the 2003 film written by Billy Ray and based upon a Vanity Fair article by Buzz Bissinger, concerning the rise and fall of disgraced journalist and former associate editor of The New Republic, Stephen Glass.
Shattered Glass is an all-encompassing account of how, over a three-year period, Glass (played by Hayden Christensen), under two different editors — the late Michael Kelly (Hank Azaria) and Chuck Lane (Peter Sarsgaard) — managed to partially or completely falsify twenty-seven of forty-one articles written for The New Republic, often referred to in the movie as “The in-flight reading material for Air Force One”. The Republic was not the only publication fooled by Glass, however, as a variety of other magazines, including Rolling Stone, George and Policy Review all published Glass’ fabricated bits.
In this film, much (due) credit is given to Forbes writer Adam Penenberg (Steve Zahn) in discovering this perpetrated fraud, when asked by his editor, “Why didn’t we get this story?”, with regards to a Glass piece entitled “Hack Heaven”. In researching Glass’ names, places and accounts, Penenberg is able to discover nary a shred of evidence, which leads to a seemingly implausible trail of deceit constructed by Glass, in a desparate attempt to cover his tracks.
The film itself does a fairly good job of illustrating the manipulative nature of Glass, who managed to turn much of the Republic‘s staff against its new editor, Lane. Actress Chloë Sevigny convincingly plays the role of “Caitlin Avey” (based upon real-life staffer Hanna Rosin), perhaps the most loyal and misled of any staffer in the film.
In this day and age, while watching this film, it is somewhat hard to suspend disbelief that Glass was able to “override” the fact checking system the way he did — searching the Internet, as Penenberg did, no longer seems to be as “novel” an approach now, as might might have been in 1998. Furthermore, from the beginning, the film’s rendition of Glass’ enthusiastic (and faked) account of his “hacker story” prior to publication will most likely be viewed with cynicism in the eyes of just about any technologically-oriented person. However, it must be realised that this is a true case of hindsight being 20/20, and that nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of journalists and readers were fooled time and time again by Glass’ actions.
The film does seem to drag on a bit near the end and Hayden Christensen’s portrayal of an ever-increasingly desparate Glass does seem a bit contrived. Furthermore the repetitive nature of some of Glass’ statements throughout the film — not to mention staffer reactions — sometimes get tiresome, but overall, this film is is pretty fascinating in exposing how one writer managed to fool well-read and well-trained readers, over and over again.
The DVD version of this film includes a 60 Minutes interview with Glass, concerning the events that unfolded. It should be noted, however, that Glass did not contribute to, nor have any comment, on the film itself.

Long before parents could blame their kids’ bad behaviour on ADD/ADHD, and before morals were taught on TV in the form of after-school specials that revolved around students and drug addiction, the magazine Highlights For Children presented kids with a far more benign viewing option that attempted to illustrate the difference between right and wrong, good and bad. Augustine would have recognised the inherent dualism immediately.
“Goofus and Gallant” is not so much a comic as it is an illustrated series of contrasting “A versus B” life decisions. Goofus, always illustrated cowlicked and with bangs and tending to have a scowl or impish look on his face, is the temperamental, misbehaved one who neglected his chores, friends, or manners; he is the antithesis to Gallant, the perfect-haired, clean-cut, well-behaved lad.
An example strip would tend to have each of the boys segregated in separate frames, but in otherwise similar scenarios or environments. Below each pane would be a sentence of text regarding how both Goofus and Gallant would behave in the situation, perhaps playing out something like this:
Frame B: “Gallant waits for Grandma to get her dinner roll, before politely asking her to pass him the basket.”
As the two always tend(ed) to look very similar in the various illustrative iterations, sometimes it has sometimes been pondered whether Goofus and Gallant are identical twin brothers, or, since they never appeared in the same frame, whether they were are perhaps different personas of the same protagonist.
Whatever the situation, Highlights is still in publication, and over the years, the behaviours and ages of neither Goofus nor Gallant have changed. This is probably a good thing, however — if they’d both grown up, Goofus would probably be smoking crack and living in an alleyway, whereas overachieving Gallant would have probably killed himself halfway through grad school, due to the intense pressure that he was under from both himself and his overbearing parents.
Now, I feel it’s necessary to clarify something: I freely admit that, from the beginning, my desires to know Angie were anything but pure; It was unrequited eros, plain and simple. I wasn’t the only one, either… there were plenty of guys that passed through that bar who, after catching a glimpse of those leather pants bent over the ice chest, had similar thoughts.
Regardless, the longer I knew her, the more I enjoyed our conversation, despite the fact that, in retrospect, it would be ridiculous to have entertained any consideration that I’d ever be with her. I still have no regrets about the money spent, time wasted — or time spent wasted — in that dimly-lit, copper-tinged bar, under her watch. Angie was a great conversationalist, and despite my introversion, I found it easy to talk with her.
As labor strikes became more prevalent, the long-held “protestant work ethic” became a less viable worldview to hold, as churches began to see the social problems that unrestrained Capitalism was unearthing, particularly amongst labourers.
aspects of socialism (specifically, the good of society, as opposed to individualistic gain) became an important plank in the concept known as the Kingdom of God,
try to overthrow existing precepts of Christianity, or throw out existing church doctrines. Instead, it attempts to redefine the focus of the faith on social change as opposed to individual salvation.
One prominent theologian in particular come to mind when considering the Kingdom of God and the Social Gospel, Walter Rauschenbusch, whose seminal work, A Theology for the Social Gospel, outlines the necessity to focus on the social conciousness within the existing Christian doctrines — in fact, some might argue that he makes social change the main focus of salvation
God…”1 Thus, regarding personal salvation, “When we submit to God, we submit to the supremacy of the common good”2 and “A religious experience is not Christian unless it binds us closer to men and commits us more deeply to the Kingdom of God.”3

A good gambler's first rule of betting is knowing when to hold ‘em, when to fold ‘em and when to take an offer from hotel and restaurant magnate Tilman Fertitta, Houston's own billionaire casino tycoon. A judge recently ruled in favor of Fertitta’s Golden Nugget Atlantic City casino in a court battle, leaving 14 mini-baccarat players out of more than $1.5 million in winnings.
The suit stems from an April 2012 mini-baccarat game where a group of players recognized a pattern in the card shuffling and began to increase their bets from $10 to $5,000. After 41 hands of mini-baccarat, the group cashed in $900,000 in chips, leaving approximately $600,000 in uncashed winnings behind.
“We will go after their property and assets. Some of them may file for bankruptcy. It didn’t have to be like this.”
The casino refused to pay the remaining winnings, saying the game was illegal because the cards were not pre-shuffled correctly. Kansas City playing card manufacturer Gemaco admitted the cards were not shuffled correctly when they were delivered to the Golden Nugget.
In August 2012, the mini-baccarat players won a ruling forcing the Golden Nugget to pay the remainder of the winnings. The Golden Nugget lawyers immediately vowed to appeal, but Fertitta himself stepped in and offered to cash in all of the remaining chips at 100 percent face value as long the 14 gamblers would dismiss any other claims against the casino (which includes a counter suit for illegal detention).
Steve Scheinthal, executive vice president and general counsel for Landry’s & Golden Nugget tells CultureMap the mini-baccarat players had their chance to work with the casino, but they gambled — and lost. Big. The group of gamblers will now have to repay the money, whether they have it or not.
“They had an opportunity for this to go away, but they were greedy,” Scheinthal says. “We will go after their property and assets. Some of them may file for bankruptcy. It didn’t have to be like this.”
New Jersey Superior Court judge James Isman issued an order that the mini-baccarat game was void and all players participating in the game must return all outstanding chips and all cash money won during the game.
So, instead of a $1.5 million payout, the group now must return all of their gambling chips to the Golden Nugget along with approximately $900,000.

With federal tax deductions and utility company rebate and incentive programs you could realize a savings of up to 70% of your total project cost.
Replacing your old, drafty windows is one of the best ways to reduce your heating and cooling costs. But, just any new window won’t necessarily solve your problems. Windows come in many shapes and sizes, to be sure, but you’ll want to consider window components to ensure that you won’t regret your purchase.
Let’s remember, you have enough to worry about. Providing Custom Blinds Union WA you with information about the components and features available on replacement windows is a contractor’s job! Frames may be made of several materials, including wood, vinyl or fiberglass. Insulated-glass can contain Argon gas for additional insulation against the elements. Frames offer the option of insulation filling vs. a multi-chambered, “dead-air” space. The only true way to make certain you buy the Union WA proper window for your home and your pocketbook is to see a physical sample of a contractor’s window right there, in the middle of your living room.
A professional will always bring a scaled-down version of his window when he visits your home. If he doesn’t have one available, you need to find another contractor. You wouldn’t purchase a car or even Wooden Blinds Union WA a barbeque without seeing it first! Why on Earth would you not do the same with windows.
While sitting in the comfort of your home, you should be able to try-out the locking mechanism. Make sure the locks are easy enough for you to operate. If it appears too difficult on the small sample window, you can be certain that it will Union WA be even harder when the larger window is installed in your home. A professional window contractor should be more than happy to allow you to inspect the windows he or she is selling.
Bang on the double-paned glass with your knuckles. That’s right, go ahead. If the glass is too thin and breaks, better to have it break into Union WA pieces BEFORE you purchase an entire house full of poorly crafted replacement windows!
Replacement of rotted woodwork and installation of exterior capping is often necessary on many houses. Make sure your window contractor has the equipment required to perform these important tasks. A “break” is piece of equipment used to bend metal so that it secures tightly against the exterior framing around Union WA your windows. An uncapped window will need to be painted routinely, otherwise it will rot, causing you more maintenance headaches in the coming years. And headaches are exactly what you’re trying to avoid, right?
If you need something that can preserve your car accessories longer, then you should consider investing on some car sun shades. These shades can protect your car’s interior from intense heat. These can also keep the inside of your car cool so you can enter it without experiencing the stifling heat of the summer trapped within your parked car.
These car sun shades are car accessories that are installed from within Shutter Blinds Union WA – on the windshield side facing the driver. These accessories are simple enough but they can be of great service to you especially in protecting your investments like your car seat covers and electronics.
– They protect the interior of your vehicle from the harmful ultra violet (UV) rays of the sun. As the ozone layer of the Earth gets thinner, the Union WA UV rays of the sun become more intense. UV ray is harmful not only to human skin but to any surface exposed to it for a period of time. For instance, prolonged exposure to the sun can damage the dashboard and car seats, fade your car seat covers, etc. Make the interior of your car comfortable and look new longer by installing car sun shades.
– These accessories cannot totally Wooden Blinds Union WA get rid of heat buildup inside your car however they can significantly lower it to tolerable levels. Car sun shades work by blocking and reflecting the hot rays of the sun so you don’t have to suffer extreme heat when you get into your car. This will also prevent the steering wheel from getting hot which can burn your palms.
– It can also protect your car electronics. If you Union WA have installed a speaker system in your vehicle, it is not a good idea to leave them lying there exposed to the sun’s heat without protection. Sun shields for vehicles can stop the sun’s damaging heat from penetrating the vehicle and wearing out your electronics.
Car sun shades are not at all costly and you can buy them from any automotive supply store. You can also buy some online to where Union WA you can find cheaper deals on any car accessory. When shopping online though, make sure that you deal only with reputable merchants as there are a lot of unscrupulous characters prowling the net. If you haven’t installed car sun shades in your vehicle yet, it is never too late to do so.
A residence with a “lived-in” appearance is a deterrent to burglars. Never leave notes that might tell a burglar that your house is unoccupied. Be sure to secure all the windows and doors before you leave. An empty garage can also let burglars know you’re away, so be sure to close the garage doors when you leave.
When you go out at night, leave one or more Kitchen Blinds Union WA interior lights turned on and a radio playing, but TV sets should not be left unattended. For a small amount, you can buy timers that will turn lights on and off when you’re gone.
Definitely do not leave door keys under flower pots or doormats, inside your unlocked mailbox, over the doorway, or in other obvious places.
Suspend milk, newspaper, and other deliveries by phone or in person Union WA well ahead of time. Do not leave notes! Schedule lawn care and have a friend or neighbour regularly remove any advertising circulars and other debris. On the other hand, leaving a few toys scattered about will create an impression of occupancy, although it will work better if the friend that removes the debris also can move the toys around from time to time!
Notify the post office to forward your mail if you’re going Ready Made Roman Blinds Union WA to be away for a while, or have a trusted friend or neighbour pick it up daily. Apartment house tenants should also do this, since stuffed mail receptacles are a dead give-away that no one is home.
Let your neighbours know you’ll be away so they can be extra alert for anything or anyone suspicious. Leave a key with them so your home or apartment can be periodically inspected. And ask them to vary Union WA the positions of your window shades and blinds.
When you leave, do not publicize your plans. Some burglars make a practice of reading newspaper accounts of other people’s vacation activities.
When you return from your trip, DO NOT ENTER your home if you find that a door or window has been forced or broken while you were away. The criminal may still be inside. Use a neighbour’s phone to call the police immediately.
Do not touch Union WA or clean up anything if a crime has occurred. Preserve the scene until police have inspected it for evidence.
Unfortunately, it has become increasingly important to make sure your home is protected whenever you’re away. Make sure, even if Union WA you’ll only be gone for a relatively short time, that you don’t make your home tempting to would-be burglars. Most of our suggestions require little or no money, and a minimal effort, but can help keep your home safe. We have many more articles on a variety of real estate-related topics, all available to you at no cost.
The shutter range these days is nothing like it used to be as they have come a long way in providing all types of shutters for both the interior and exterior of your home. Wooden made shutters, especially cedar have proven to be the most popular for quite some time although you can buy shutters in other materials such as vinyl if you prefer.
When it comes to buying shutters you have several factors to think Honeycomb Blinds Union WA about which include selecting the style, the type of finish you want, the panel configuration and last but by no means least how much you want to spend.
As far as styles go you have a choice of what’s known as traditional or plantation shutters. These are the main two types you will find being sold. Traditional shutters use narrow shutter panels which are usually in the shape of a wedge where they look thicker in Union WA the front and narrower in the back where as plantation shutters offer much thicker, flat shutter panels so the choice is yours depending on what your preferences are.
When I chose my shutters I went for the traditional kind because they matched in quite nicely with the Venetian blinds I had, but that was just me. Obviously, we all have different tastes but it is a good idea to think about what would look good with Vertical Blinds Union WA the window coverings you have at the moment unless you plan on changing them altogether.
As for the finish, many people opt for natural looking shutters and use staining to give the desired effect. The other popular choice is to use white paint or a varying shade of white depending on what suits but you can use pretty much any colour you like. I’ve seen pink and yellow coloured houses in Scotland that have gone ahead Union WA and painted their shutters in the same colours so it’s really up to you although you’ll find that most shutter companies will either sell them in a wood tone or a white finish.
As for the configuration of shutter panels, this really depends on the size of your window and the style that you go for as there is some degree of flexibility with having more or less panels than normal. You can also have shutters Union WA custom made to your specs as well if you like. A standard size window may use 20 panels but you want to have 30, in which case you would ask the shutter company to design the panels to be narrower to fit in with what you’re after. This however is a rather more expensive option and you will be better off just going with what’s available if you’re sticking to a budget.
Speaking of budgets, just Union WA like most things price is very important and the amount you pay will largely depend on what you need. Before you do any research or go anywhere it’s a good idea to sit down and ask yourself the following questions.
Writing your answers down on a piece of paper will help give you an idea of exactly what you want and what you can afford. Shutter Union WA companies usually base the price on the exact size of window, therefore the exact size of shutter needed and the style, the finish and how many panels you require. So with all the questions already answered you should have no problems getting an exact quote.
If you are on a tight budget and you plan to buy interior shutters a cheaper option may be to buy blinds instead. You can pick up some pretty good blinds Union WA at a cheap price if you keep your eye out but bear in mind that blinds don’t last as long as shutters. I love my shutters but I wouldn’t dream of using them on sliding doors as blinds are much better, especially these days with the new types that are available.
When it comes to tall windows it’s often a better idea to have two or three sets of shutters on the same window as there Union WA are maximum panel guidelines between shutter panels. One way round this however is to use a dividing rail between the panels in the same frame and whichever method you choose you are going to end up with two or three louver sections in any case. This is good because you will be able to open and close them independently of one another, offering you more flexibility with sunlight control.
There is a maximum panel size with Union WA shutters which is another reason why blinds are a better option for large windows and doors. Consult the shutters and blinds salesman on which would be the best option for what you need and they should be able to help you out.

I have a friend who once told me, "Richard, if you want a big church, all you have to do is throw a Bible prophecy conference and tell everyone that Jesus is coming back very soon." And as I take a look at Christian bookstores and Christian television, I'm convinced he's right. Lots of people are excited about prophecy because they're convinced that the prophets of old tell them that Jesus is coming back very soon.
Most Christians pay little attention to Old Testament prophecy, but when they do their thoughts run immediately to things like the second coming of Christ and other end-of-the-world events. Christian leaders of many different denominations encourage people to look for these themes on every page of the prophetic writings. Although our minds almost naturally run to these themes, in these lessons we're going to take a much more sober approach to Old Testament prophecy — the approach that the prophets themselves took. And as we do, we'll discover that the prophets had much, much more to say than we can possibly imagine.
We have entitled this lesson, "Essential Hermeneutical Perspectives," because we'll identify the hermeneutical or interpretative considerations which we must all grasp if we're going to handle biblical prophecy responsibly. This opening lesson will divide into four parts — our confusion about Old Testament prophecy; and then we'll look at three topics that will help us overcome this confusion: the nature of a prophet's experience, the importance of finding the original meaning, and finally, New Testament perspectives on Old Testament prophecy. Let's take a look first at our confusion.
Have you ever noticed how most Christians know some parts of the Bible better than they know others? In the Old Testament, the stories of the Pentateuch are very familiar. Motivated Bible readers know Joshua and Judges, and a few believers even understand a lot about books like Samuel, and Kings and Chronicles. But, as soon as someone asks, "What is Isaiah about?" or "How about that Zephaniah?" "Isn't Haggai a thrilling book?" — well, we're left dumbfounded because we know so little about these books. Even pastors and other Christian teachers tend to avoid careful explanations about Old Testament prophets because they're so confused about this part of the Bible.
As we begin this study of Old Testament prophecy, it's important that we start with a look at our confusion. We'll ask two basic questions: what are the sources of our confusion, and what are some of the results of this confusion. Let's begin with a look at the sources of confusion that so many of us feel about Old Testament prophecy.
There are at least two things that cause many Christians to have problems with this part of Scripture. First, the prophetic books themselves, and second, disharmony in the church.
Let's face it, the books of prophecy contained in Scripture are probably the most difficult parts of the Bible to grasp. Most Christians have a hard time even pronouncing the names of some prophets, much less understanding what they said. We're frequently perplexed by the contents of their books. They seem disjointed; one verse doesn't seem to lead to the next, and prophets seem to talk in riddles and in puzzles. And sometimes their words just don't make sense to us at all.
And if this weren't enough, we don't know much about the historical events of this period of the Bible. The kings, nations, wars and other events are so complex that we have a hard time keeping our bearings. When most Christians read Old Testament prophets, they feel as if they've entered into a very strange, foreign land. The street signs don't make sense. The customs are bizarre. And we walk around bewildered because of the difficulties that the prophetic books themselves present.
There's a second major source of our confusion: the church. The Christian church has wonderful harmony of teaching in so many areas. But, when it comes to interpreting Old Testament prophecy, there is hardly any harmony at all, only disagreement. You've heard the debates — what are you? A premillennial dispensationalist? Do you believe in pre-tribulation rapture or mid-tribulation rapture or post-tribulation rapture? How about becoming a postmillennialist or a historical premillennialist? Or are you a pessimistic or optimistic amillennialist? We go to one denomination and hear that everyone else is wrong. Then we go to another group and hear just the opposite. Although evangelicals agree on the essentials of the faith, there is hardly any agreement among us, when it comes to prophecy. The church has been so divided about the interpretation of the prophets that it is difficult for us to come to these texts with much confidence at all.
This deep confusion we feel has led to some regrettable results. I can think of at least two major results from the confusion that we have over of this part of the Bible: victimization and apathy.
Victimization happens all around us. There's so much disagreement and confusion that so-called "prophecy experts" rise to bring order to the confusion. They do this by going around and teaching their opinions, as if they were absolutely certain.
Several examples of victimization like this come to my mind. In recent decades, countless books and teachers have said that the establishment of Israel in 1948 marked the last generation before Christ's return. It used to be taught widely that Christ had to return within one forty-year generation after 1948. "Only one generation after Israel returns to the land, the Bible says forty years, and Christ will come back for his church."
Well, forty years have passed and nothing happened. We might have hoped that the passing of 1988 would have stopped the speculations, but it hasn't. As the years have passed by, prophecy experts have turned their attention elsewhere — now they claim that the year 2000 brings us to the threshold of the end of time. Expectations are feverish again — even magazines and tabloids tell us that Apocalypse is just around the corner. All the signs are pointing to the end. They tell us that every current event, every war, every earthquake, every economic trouble, shows us that Old Testament prophecies about the return of Christ are about to be fulfilled. And of course, the practical application of many of these prophecy conferences is this: "Buy my books." "Give money to my ministry." Sadly, Christians are easily victimized by these so-called "experts." Thousands of us bounce from one interpretation to another just because we don't know how to understand prophets for ourselves.
Victimization is just one result of our confusion about Old Testament prophecy. There is another result that we can see as well. Many times, we become apathetic about understanding this part of the Bible. Many Christians seem to go through phases in their approach to prophecy. At first, they begin with a lot of enthusiasm. They hear someone teach and they find a lot of excitement in going to conferences and reading books about prophets. But, the next thing you know, these believers find themselves in crisis, because their teachers have told them things that just don't turn out to be true. And in many cases, these same Christians end up with great apathy. They give up on trying to understand this part of the Bible.
That's what happened to me when I was in high school. I was a brand new Christian and all my teachers told me, "Richard, Jesus is coming back very soon." So, I even gave up on the idea of going to college. Happily, I discovered they were wrong very quickly, and I went on and made a life for myself. But I became very apathetic about Old Testament prophecy. I thought to myself, "I can't understand this part of the Bible. I just have to deal with other parts that I can understand." And I have to tell you, everywhere I go, I see Christians who are apathetic about Old Testament prophecy.
I'm afraid that many believers today are apathetic about Old Testament prophecy. They give up on trying to understand this part of the Bible because they're tired of disappointment and they're tired of being victimized. I can't tell you how many pastors I've heard say, "Don't worry about prophecy. You'll never understand it anyway." So, we just forget about this part of the Bible.
Well, it's time to change this situation. We need to learn about Old Testament prophecy so that we will not be victimized "by every wind of doctrine." But, we must also learn about prophecy so we can avoid apathy. God did not include prophecy in the Bible so that we would ignore it. He gave us this part of Scripture so that we could benefit from it in countless ways and we should not be satisfied to remain ignorant or confused about prophecy.
I think we all recognize these problems with Old Testament prophecies, but now we have to ask another question. What kinds of things do we need to understand in order to avoid these problems, in order to increase our knowledge and understanding of Old Testament prophecies? There are at least three major topics that we must explore to avoid victimization and apathy. We need to learn about the nature of a prophet's experience, and we must also reaffirm the importance of the original meaning of prophecies. And we need to gain a better understanding of how the New Testament handled Old Testament prophecies. These three topics are so important that we'll deal with them throughout these lessons. At this point, we will simply introduce some preliminary thoughts.
Let's take a look first at the experience of an Old Testament prophet. If we ever hope to handle Old Testament prophecy more responsibly we must look carefully at the experience of prophets. What happened to these messengers from God? What did they experience as they announced God's Word? As I have read and listened to people talking about prophets, at least three misconceptions about their experiences have come to the foreground. Many Christians misunderstand the mental state of prophets. We also misunderstand the ways in which God inspired the words of prophets. And we often don't have the right idea about the comprehension of Old Testament prophets, what they understood about their words.
In the first place, many students of Scripture act as if the prophets were practically out of their minds when they received their prophecies. The prophets were so overwhelmed by the Spirit of God that they lost their senses. They went into a state of feverish delirium, much like Canaanite prophets of Baal, and other religions of the ancient and modern world.
Now as widespread as this outlook on prophets may be, it does not match up with the evidence of Scripture. I think we can be sure there were times when Old Testament prophets were astonished by what they saw and heard from God. We can only imagine the state of mind Ezekiel must have been in when in chapter 8, the Spirit of God picked him up by his hair and carried him hundreds of miles from Babylon to the temple in Jerusalem. But even in this condition, Ezekiel was not completely beside himself. He did not lose his mind. Instead, when we read this portion of the book of Ezekiel, we find that he was able to interact reasonably with God. Even in dramatic situations Old Testament prophets remained alert and aware as God revealed his Word to them.
A second widespread misconception of the prophet's experience has to do with the ways in which they were inspired by God.
Unfortunately, many Christians approach Old Testament prophets as if they were mechanically inspired. We treat the prophets as if they were mere dictation machines. When Isaiah spoke, he merely allowed God to move his lips. When Amos preached, God forced every word through his mouth. We know better than to think this way about other parts of the Bible, but when it comes to Old Testament prophets, we frequently treat them as if they were passive instruments of revelation, mere mechanical mouthpieces of God.
In contrast with this popular way of looking at the inspiration, in these lessons we'll operate with a view called "organic inspiration." We believe that the Holy Spirit inspired the writings of prophets so that they have no errors. But, at the same time, we know that when God inspired the writing of Scripture he used the personalities and the thoughts and the outlooks of human writers. In the New Testament we know this is true. Paul's epistles reflect his personality and background. And we also recognize that the differences among the four gospels result primarily from differences in the human writers' intentions and goals. In much the same way, God used the personalities, the experiences, and the intentions of prophets as he inspired them. If we hope to understand Old Testament prophecy, we must reject a mechanical understanding of their experience and begin to look for the ways God inspired them as full, thinking human beings.
In line with our other misconceptions of prophets' experiences, we often don't have a very good idea of how much prophets understood their words. In fact, most Christians act as if the prophets were ignorant, or unable to understand what they were saying. For instance, if someone had stopped Amos and asked him, "What do you mean by what you're saying?" most Christians think that Amos would have to have responded this way: "I don't know what I'm saying, I just say what God tells me to say."
Well, in contrast with this misconception, the Bible teaches that prophets had understanding. They understood much of what they said. For instance, in Daniel 12:8, Daniel did confess,
But we have to be careful to discern what Daniel meant. He explained himself as he continued to speak to the Lord,
You see, Daniel understood what he had heard and written; he knew the vocabulary; he knew the grammar — these were his words, after all. But, he did not understand everything. He admitted not knowing precisely how the prophecy would be fulfilled.
In much the same way, 1 Peter 1:11 tells us that Old Testament prophets understood, but they did not understand all that they had said. There, Peter says the prophets of old tried:
… to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing (1 Peter 1:11).
In other words, Peter said that Old Testament prophets remained ignorant of the details of timing and circumstances, but he does not suggest for a moment that they were entirely without understanding of their words. On the contrary, as we will see, prophets were very much aware, they comprehended much of what they were saying. Rather than being ignorant, they had tremendous insights into the ways of God.
There are many misconceptions about the experience of Old Testament prophets, and we have only touched on three: their mental state, their inspiration, and their comprehension of their prophecies. And if we can ever hope to understand prophecy correctly, we must always remember that they were mentally aware, that they were organically inspired and that they comprehended much of what they had to say. If we will remember these things, we can go a long way in interpreting Old Testament prophecy.
With this orientation toward a prophet's experience in mind, we may now turn to a second essential hermeneutical perspective: the importance of the original meaning of a prophecy.
From the time of the Reformation, evangelicals have always believed that we must first discover the original meaning of a passage and then submit ourselves to the authority of that original meaning. Well, when it comes to other parts of the Bible, we're happy to do that, but with Old Testament prophecy, we forget this basic hermeneutical principle. To explore how we do this, we have to look at two different matters. First, popular approaches to exegesis, and then the proper approach to the exegesis of Old Testament prophets. Let's look first at the very widespread, popular approaches to the original meaning of Old Testament prophecy.
Everywhere you turn today, well-meaning Christians interpret the prophets with very little attention to the original meaning intended by the prophets. These popular approaches may be characterized in at least two ways: they are atomistic, and they are ahistorical.
What do we mean when we say that popular exegesis is atomistic? Well, it's very typical for Christians to read the prophets as collections of loosely connected predictions. Instead of reading carefully through large sections of a prophetic book, we are usually satisfied to focus on a catch phrase, or some special word. At times, a few verses come under consideration, but that's about as large a context as most Christians consider when they read Old Testament prophets. An atomistic approach to Old Testament prophecy simply won't do.
As sad as it is, most evangelicals also don't concern themselves with the historical context of prophets. They don't focus on the human writer and they don't consider the circumstances and the needs of the original audiences of Old Testament prophecies.
Instead, prophecies are treated as if they were empty canisters just waiting to be filled with meaning. We don't find the original meaning that fills these canisters already. Instead, we supply our own meaning by looking at events in our day. We look at what is happening in our world and we seek to fill up the empty canisters of prophecy with current, historical events.
I remember teaching in a wonderful church in Europe, and during the question and answer time, a fellow in the back of the room raised his hand up and he said, "Do you think that the disaster at Chernobyl is a sign of the end of time?" Well, I looked at my translator and I said, "Did he really say that?" And the translator said, "Sure," because the word "Chernobyl" in this man's language meant "wormwood," and in Jeremiah 23, the word "wormwood" is used and associated with the end of time. Well, what did this fellow do? He had found a word in the Bible and he had associated it with something in his experience and as a result, he came up with a sign of the end of times. Well, what are we to do, except read our own ideas into the Bible, when we read it atomistically and without any concern for the historical context of the Old Testament prophets?
Reading our own meaning into Old Testament prophecy is widespread because so many of us read these texts atomistically and without concern for the historical context of the writer and the audience. When original meaning is ignored, we can do very little but read our own ideas into these Scriptures.
The only way to correct popular approaches to Old Testament prophecy is to develop a proper concern with the original meaning of these texts. In many respects, all we have to do is apply the basic principles of interpretation that we use in other parts of the Bible. The original meaning of prophecy is to be discovered through grammatico-historical exegesis. This is the only anchor that will keep us from pouring our own meanings into the prophets.
As the term "grammatico-historical" suggests, we must focus on two elements to discover the original meaning. First, we must look at the grammar of a prophecy and we do this by focusing on the literary context. And second, we must concern ourselves with the historical context of the original writer and the original audience.
As we will see in these lessons, it is simply not enough for us to focus on a word or two here and there, as popular atomistic approaches do. We have to learn how to handle large sections of material, verses and chapters, sections of books, even whole books of prophecy.
Christians are often satisfied simply to notice certain key words — "virgin" and "child," and when they do, they feel very comfortable that they have understood what this passage means.
As much as we may feel comfortable with this approach to Isaiah 7:14, to be responsible with this passage, we must go beyond these few key words to consider the entire context. How does this verse fit within Isaiah 7, and how does it fit within this part of the book of Isaiah? And how does it contribute to the whole purpose and meaning of the book of Isaiah? It is only when we set this one verse within its larger context that we can be sure we have understood it correctly.
In addition to looking at the larger literary context of a prophecy, proper exegesis also includes reading prophecies within their historical context. We must think about the writer and the audience. When most Christians read prophecies, they act as if these Scriptures float in timeless space. But grammatico-historical exegesis requires us to put these prophecies back on earth. We ask questions like these: "Who wrote these words?" "When were they written?" "To whom was he writing?" and "Why were these words written?"
For example, when approaching Isaiah 7:14, we should not think of this as a mere batch of words floating in heaven, simply waiting to touch ground when Jesus was born. We must bring this verse down to earth. We have to remember that we are reading a passage that describes Isaiah speaking to Ahaz, the King of Judah. And then we have to ask questions like these: "Why did Isaiah say these words to Ahaz?" "What were their circumstances?" "What was the purpose?" And it is only by considering this historical setting that we can ever hope to understand this passage correctly.
So, we see that we have to reject popular approaches to Old Testament prophets, which are atomistic and ahistorical, and instead we have to work hard to discover the original meaning through grammatico-historical exegesis. Once we understand the original meaning of a prophecy, then we have a secure anchor that will help us understand how to apply prophecy today.
So far, we have seen two areas that we must learn about to overcome our confusion about Old Testament prophets: the prophet's experience, and the importance of original meaning. Now we must turn to a third area that needs careful attention — New Testament perspectives on prophecy.
When we consider the outlooks of the New Testament on Old Testament prophecy, many issues come to the foreground. We will return to this subject in later lessons, but at this point it will be helpful to deal with two dimensions of New Testament perspectives: First, the New Testament outlook on the authority of the prophets; and second, the ways in which the New Testament applied Old Testament prophecy.
Jesus and the New Testament apostles often showed that they were fully convinced of the authority of Old Testament prophets. They appealed to the writings of the prophets as authoritative, and they also appealed to the intentions of prophets as authoritative.
In the first place, Jesus and his apostles affirmed their submission to the sacred Scriptures of the prophets. It nearly goes without saying that Jesus was faithful to the teachings of biblical Judaism in his day. Of course, one of the central teachings of Judaism of that time was the absolute authority of the Hebrew Bible, and this is why Jesus frequently affirmed that his ministry was in accordance with the sacred Scriptures of the Old Testament. For example, in Matthew 5:17, Jesus himself said:
Notice here that Jesus did not simply say that he recognized the authority of Moses, but he also recognized the authority of the prophetic writings. All the writers of the New Testament followed Christ in this way. They constantly referred to the prophets as authoritative Scriptures.
As important as it is to see that Jesus and his apostles loved the sacred texts of the prophets, it is just as important for us to realize that they were committed to the original intentions of the prophets as well. New Testament writers were not arbitrary in the ways they understood prophecy. They did not impose their own meanings on prophets. Instead, they were deeply concerned with discovering the original meaning of a prophecy and then building on that solid foundation.
It is very popular today for people to think that New Testament writers had a God-given right to interpret the Old Testament any way they wanted to. But nothing could be further from the truth. Two passages from the New Testament will show that New Testament writers were very concerned with the original meaning of Old Testament prophecies.
We can see this deep commitment to the intentions of prophets in the ways that Peter explains himself in Acts 2:29-31. After quoting part of Psalm 16, Peter says this in verse 29:
Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day, but he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ (Acts 2:29-31).
Notice that Peter did not claim some right to read his own Christian ideas into Psalm 16. On the contrary, he interpreted David's prophetic words in the light of David's experience and David's intentions.
In much the same way, the apostle John also revealed a deep concern with the original meaning of prophecy. In John 12:39-40, John refers to the prophecies of Isaiah 6. Listen to what he says:
As Isaiah says elsewhere: "He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn — and I would heal them" (John 12:39-40).
John applied this passage from Isaiah to the ministry of Jesus. But listen to the way he validated his interpretation. In the very next verse, John 12:41, he appealed to the prophet's intentions.
John focused his attention on the experience of Isaiah and how Isaiah intended for his words to be understood. John did not take Isaiah's prophecy in a way that was convenient for his own goals. Instead, he sought to submit himself to the organically inspired intentions of the prophet.
As Christians, we must seek to follow the example of New Testament writers. We should not only look at the Old Testament prophetic text as authoritative, but we must also seek to discover the original meaning behind those prophecies.
Now, as important as the original meaning of prophecy was to Jesus and the writers of the New Testament, they did not simply repeat the original meaning. Instead, Christ and his followers were committed to applying the prophetic word to the dramatic acts of God that were happening in their day. To see how this application process worked, we need to consider two ideas. First, what kinds of expectations for the future did the prophets present? And then, how did New Testament writers see the fulfillment of these expectations?
Throughout these lessons, we'll be describing the kinds of hopes and expectations that the Old Testament predicted for the future. But for now, we will speak in general terms, simply to provide an orientation toward New Testament perspectives. Put simply, the prophets knew that sin had wreaked havoc in the world. Even the people of God had become so corrupted that God drove them into exile. But despite these terrible results of sin, the prophets looked forward to a time when God would set things straight. This future would be a time of ultimate judgment against the wicked and eternal blessing for the faithful. The prophets had all kinds of terms they used to describe this climax of human history. They spoke of it as, "The Day of the Lord." They spoke of it as, "The Latter Days." This great future would be a time when God intervened into the world and brought all things to their final end.
Now, the New Testament had special ways of handling these Old Testament prophetic expectations. We need to see how they understood the fulfillment of all these hopes in Christ. In the days of Jesus and the apostles, many Israelites expected that the Day of Retribution was coming very soon. They longed for the Messiah, who would bring human history to its climax. And in a word, Christians received Jesus as the Messiah, and therefore as the fulfillment of all of these prophetic hopes. Jesus became the hermeneutical center for Christian understanding of Old Testament prophecy.
Jesus himself insisted that interpretation of the prophets must be Christ-centered. He stressed the importance of Christ-centered interpretation on the road to Emmaus as he talked to his disciples. In Luke 24:25-26, Jesus said these words:
How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory? (Luke 24:25-26).
Jesus expected his followers to see him as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. For this reason, the next verse, Luke 24:27, tells us this,
And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself (Luke 24:27).
Notice how Luke put it — Jesus explained all the prophets said about him. So it is that New Testament writers affirmed the importance of the original expectations of prophecy. But they also related these prophetic expectations to the person and work of Christ.
Originally, Old Testament prophets set a trajectory of hope, a trajectory of expectation. A future time of great judgment and blessing was coming. Now the New Testament takes that trajectory and traces it into the future and finds fulfillment in the first coming of Christ, in his kingdom today and in the end of the world when Christ returns in glory.
As we will see later in this series of lessons, the New Testament explains that Christ fulfilled all Old Testament prophetic expectations in these three stages of his kingdom: he accomplished much in the inauguration of his kingdom, his earthly ministry two thousand years ago; he continues to fulfill Old Testament expectations in the continuation of his kingdom throughout the whole history of the church; and in the end, Christ will bring all prophecies to complete fulfillment when he returns and brings the consummation of his kingdom. These three stages of Christ's work provided New Testament writers with a hermeneutical model, and with this model, they were able to apply all the expectations and hopes of the Old Testament prophets to their day.
As followers of Christ, we must also learn how to take the expectations of Old Testament prophecy and apply them to the first coming of Christ, the continuation of his kingdom and the second coming of Christ.
In this introductory lesson, we have touched on four subjects that will guide our entire study of Old Testament prophecy. We must overcome our confusion over this part of the Bible, by focusing on three essential hermeneutical perspectives: we must learn about the experience of prophets, and we must reaffirm the importance of the original meaning of prophecy. And then we must learn how to follow the New Testament perspectives on prophecy.
In the lessons that follow, we are going to explore these three essential hermeneutical perspectives even further. First, we will take a look at the experience of a prophet, and then we are going to take a look at the importance of original meaning. And then, finally, we will explore even more thoroughly how New Testament writers handled Old Testament prophecy. As we look at these various topics, we will discover an outlook on prophecy that will edify the church, and bring glory to our God.

I am looking for a new host - one that will support PHP code that contains socket opens (to talk to other web servers), at non-standard ports (such as 8080).
Example: http://209.204.213.124/u.php - when viewed from a browser, should have first line saying "Success!"
Can someone who has the “Level 1” program at DreamHost (with non-unique IP address) tell me if that PHP code will work on their site?
I would really appreciate it if you can copy over the u.txt file to a u.php file on your server, and then go to web browser to visit that page, and tell me if it says “Success” or "Could not contact…"
Or, if you know for sure whether outgoing ports are open for DreamHost servers. Note that I’m not asking about incoming ports - I know that only port 80 may be kept open for incoming requests, other ports may all be closed.
This tests whether the PHP code can eventually do things like: fopen(“http://${remotehost}:${remoteport}/test.txt”)

Can you see the sexual subliminal in this? It shows the swimmer’s shoulder and armpit, but if you glance at it briefly it could be interpreted as a perspective shot of his bottom! Of course this is an ad aimed at men, not women, so the image is homoerotic. But that’s how they get into our subconscious because for most of us any homosexual urges we might have are suppressed in our subconscious, so by accessing them an advertiser has a short cut to our subconscious! Diet Coke is marketed more towards women than men so this is why the old bottles had a subliminal that looked like women’s breasts on the label.
Advertisers use sexual subliminals all the time to draw attention and therefore success. A subliminal is anything that causes sensory stimuli that we experience below the threshold of our awareness. A lot of psychological research has shown that engineering subliminal messages in another medium works. In 1959 an experiment was done at a number of American cinemas when the film Ben Hur was released. The experimenters took a number of reels and put subliminal flash-frames in half them showing a Coca-Cola advert. As far as the conscious visual perception goes these flash-frames were invisible; if you were watching one of these reels there would be no way you’d be able to tell, even if you were warned to look out in advance, whether the subliminal frames were present or not. But the experiment showed that Coca-Cola sales were higher in the cinemas showing the flash-framed reels than the control group (Can’t remember the source).
The psychological illusionist Derren Brown has carried out a similar experiment on TV. I differ from Derren’s Skeptical views on Spiritualism and other things, but he’s bang on the money here: http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=FEpdTZGfxCQ&feature=related
In my view subliminals are highly dangerous psychological weapons. Manipulating us to part with our money in exchange for worthless consumer-durables is their most benign function. They can, and are, also used by politicians to influence the people. For example when the West was trying to demonize the Libyan president Colonel Qaddafi they used embedded subliminals on the cover of Time magazine (David Icke live 2006). Experiments have also shown that subliminals, like more obvious forms of propaganda, have a much reduced effect if the subject is aware that they are being targeted; so this is why I’m writing this article, to make you aware!

Ben-I hope you have had a wonderful holiday season-I have spent most of the day curled up in bed-but I am very thankful for what I DO have and am not complaining-I am glad folks I link to do not seem to be putting up much new stuff-I am already so behind on reading everyone's work! I could not agree with your thoughts in this post more completely-I have seen this in so many adds both aimed at repressed urges hetero and homosexual and also-I have seen ads where I think a child is 'posed' entirely inappropriately for their age-this has happened far too many times to be accidental. Best to you as always-I hope you and yours had a splendid holiday and are getting ready to have a wonderful 2009!
Hi Devin, I had a nice Christmas; Thanks. I had to go to work, but at a hospital someone's got to do it! I know what you mean about being behind with my reading.
There's so much info out there and only so many hours in da day, Bwana! It's like trying to drink out of a firehose! Glad you had a good day curled up in bed. We're not encouraged mto be kind to ourselves and we're made to feel guilty if we do, so good on ya!
There's a brilliant website somewhere with subliminals on, but I can't find it. I'll have to check through my David Icke books because it's in there somewhere.
Seem to be noticing more & more these days myself - shapes just jump out at me. I think once you are aware they are there your mind keeps on the look out & they're easier to see, I do try & point them out but often get strange looks!!
There was one a couple of weeks ago, it was all in the layout of the words, like one of those magic eye pics, they rearranged themselves before my eyes & turned into a skull - wish I'd had my camera.
Hi WW, myes I remember that icecream poster you saw! They use bizarre and frightening images as well as sexy ones.
Someone on the David Icke forum spotted more subliminals on this poster. Do you see the word "SEX" written on his shoulder/ right bum cheek? It's made out of water drops and the X is the most prominent bit.

This September, 2018, will mark the 40th anniversary of One Elephant, Deux Elephant, the ground-breaking and career producing first album of Sharon, Lois and Bram.
On the eve of this Anniversary, Sharon & Bram wish to introduce to their music to a fourth generation of fans. This tour is intended to honour the musicality that Sharon, Lois & Bram brought to their very first album, forty years ago, and have maintained over the subsequent forty years.
Since 1978, Sharon Hampson and Bram Morrison have been pre-eminent in all aspects of family entertainment across North America as members of the trio “Sharon, Lois & Bram”. Together, the threesome produced over twenty recordings, beginning with their iconic ‘One Elephant, Deux Elephants’, three song-books, six national TV specials, sixty-five episodes of The Elephant Show, and fifty-two of Skinnamarink TV. They have appeared in every major concert hall in Canada, and many in the United States including Carnegie Hall, The Lincoln Center and the White House in Washington just to name a few. They have received countless awards, including Gold and Platinum Records and JUNO awards for Best Children’s Album. To date, they have sold over 3 million albums worldwide.
Sharon and Bram have carried on together since Lois Lillenstein stepped aside from live performing in 2000. This incarnation of one of North America’s most popular family acts ranges from a “sweet and simple” folksy duo performance, to a larger production featuring members of the versatile Skinnamarink Band.
A Sharon and Bram show is a sing-along concert for the entire family, featuring such well-loved favourites as “She’ll Be Coming ‘Round the Mountain”, “Five Little Monkeys”, “One Elephant”, “Tingalayo”, and, of course, “Skinnamarink”.
“We love singing with our audiences; the sound of families singing together and the expressions of delight on the faces of parents and children as they share the music, bring us deep satisfaction”, say Sharon and Bram.
Sharon and Bram, with Lois, have supported many social welfare programmes in Canada and the US, such as school breakfasts for learning, encouraging parents to inoculate their children and, internationally, as Goodwill Ambassadors for UNICEF in North and South America, for which they received the Danny Kaye Humanitarian Award.
For their years of work providing the best in participatory music for children and their families, Sharon and Bram have been inducted into The Order of Canada, the highest honour in the country.

It is important to consult with your doctor regarding your maximum level of medical recovery before settling your claim. Your injury may be one that will heal completely, with no lasting after effects, or it may be one that could potentially crop up again from time to time, causing discomfort, limiting your movement, and requiring medical care and treatment. In some cases, injuries can end up resulting in degenerative conditions that worsen over time, requiring increasing levels of care while preventing and having the potential to hasten disability or even death.

Because of the 2013 annual exclusion, each person can gift up to $14,000 a year to one or more donees without having to file a gift tax return and without eating into their lifetime exclusion ($5.25 million for 2013). For example, each year a married couple with 7 grandchildren (or children, friends, neighbors, etc.) could gift as a couple $28,000 per person (7 x $28k = $196k each year). Making gifts of portions of a family business or other business assets like stock options, can significantly reduce or eliminate estate taxes.
Making annual or sporadic gifts whether the client is single or married can significantly reduce the size of an estate over the years, particularly if there are a number of donees (since each can receive $14,000 a year per donor). However, the reality is that many people are afraid to make gifts because: [1] they believe there is a chance they will need to money later, [2] they do not want the kids to think this is something they should expect on a regular basis and/or [3] they do not want the kids to have this money right now (or become dependent on it).
Your client can also use a number of different types of trusts to save on overall estate taxes, depending on circumstances and desires.
Perhaps the only positive thing that can be said about death is that heirs receive a step-up in basis. The step-up applies to all assets inherited except: annuities, qualified retirement accounts and IRAs. This means that it is almost always desirable for your client to hold on to highly appreciated property until it can pass at death. If assets are to be gifted while the client is alive, it is usually best to gift assets that have appreciated little and have limited, or no, appreciation potential (e.g., bank accounts, CDs, bonds, money market funds, annuities and cash). However, if the donee is in a lower bracket than the donor, there can be modest or significant tax savings if the new owner (the donee) sells the gifted asset.
Under federal tax law, the basis of inherited property is adjusted up or down to the market value as of the date of death. Gifts made during life are not entitled to a stepped-up basis. Only transfers at death qualify for this desirable tax treatment.
There are two types of state taxes to consider when making decisions about how to leave property: inheritance taxes and estate taxes. Inheritance taxes are imposed on the people who receive the property (beneficiaries or heirs), rather than on the estate itself. Typically, beneficiaries are divided into different classes, such as “Class A: Husband or Wife,” “Class B: Immediate Family,” and “Class C: All Others.” Each class receives different tax exemptions and is taxed at a different rate. Generally, the highest exemption and lowest rate goes to spouses, or “Class A.” For example, Nebraska imposes a 15% inheritance tax rate on $25,000 left to a friend, but only 1% if it’s left to your child. Many states impose no inheritance tax at all on property left to a surviving spouse.
As mentioned earlier, residents of a c/p state have a huge advantage over those domiciled in a common law state: in a c/p state, when either spouse dies, all c/p gets a step-up in basis (even though there is a surviving spouse). In common law states, only the property owned by a deceased spouse receives a stepped-up basis. In a common law state, no property of a surviving spouse receives a stepped-up basis, even if that property was held in shared ownership with the deceased spouse.
States that impose estate or inheritance taxes on residents do so on everyone domiciled in the state. Domicile means the state where you have your permanent residence, where you intend to make your home. Generally, it is clear where domicile is: it is the state where you live most of the time, work, own a home, and vote.

News flash for male political candidates: Trying to mock or shame your female opponents is probably going to backfire on you.
All over the country, women are running for elected office -- and winning -- in record numbers. This pink wave, fueled in large part by President Donald Trump’s win over Hillary Clinton, is a real phenomenon. And while more Republican women are running, too, Democrats far outnumber their GOP counterparts.
And given all this momentum from women (who are also motivated to vote, by the way) some male candidates are resorting to bullying tactics that aren’t resonating with voters. At least that’s what the polls suggest.
Take the governor’s race here in Michigan. Republican contender Attorney General Bill Schuette has made comparing Gretchen Whitmer, his Democratic opponent, with former Gov. Jennifer Granholm a campaign pillar.
That’s not sitting well with Whitmer. Nor does it seem to be winning broad support, especially with independents. A Detroit News and WDIV-TV poll out this week found that Whitmer leads Schuette by nearly 14 points.
Whitmer has capitalized on the attacks, and in a radio interview, she said: “I’m not going to get distracted by his superficial, sexist barbs.”
Patrice Lee Onwuka, senior policy analyst with the Independent Women’s Forum, says given the rise of #MeToo and the wave of women candidates, male candidates should be extra cautious.
The 6th congressional district in that state went for Trump by double digits in 2016. And it was seen as a safe seat for Republican incumbent Rep. Andy Barr. But that race is now considered a toss-up.
Democrat Amy McGrath, political outsider and former Marine combat aviator, is winning over voters. Barr has responded with attack ads, calling McGrath “too liberal” and a “feminist.”
Onwuka points to other examples around the country where sexism is being used to undermine women candidates. Women often are criticized for their appearance, intelligence or whether they can balance motherhood and politics -- criticisms men don’t have to endure.
Cori Bush, a Democrat running for Congress in Missouri, has been mocked for the size of her hips and thighs. But she’s fought back and has gotten some high-profile support in the process.
And Rachel Hundley, a millennial councilwoman from Sonoma, California, has called out a group that threatened to “slut-shame” her by exposing some compromising photos from her past in an attempt to get her to drop her re-election campaign.
In a video she posted to YouTube, Hundley says the group was trying to "silence another strong female voice by scaring me out of this election."
"For too long, it has been seen as OK to control women by dictating what is acceptable for us to wear, say and do.”
Democratic strategist Jill Alper is working on several campaigns for female gubernatorial candidates, and she says women traditionally have to overcome a higher barrier when running. But this year is out of the ordinary.
“I think that there are clearly unique things going on where there are more women running and winning and voting,” Alper says.
She also points to how negative attacks against women can work to their advantage. EMILY’s List, a backer of the Women’s March, helps fundraise for Democratic, pro-choice women candidates and gets its name from “early money is like yeast." The idea is that early advertising leads to more attacks from male opponents -- and an increased likelihood the woman will win.

It was about 5 years ago that I decided to look into becoming a web developer. I was in a miserable corporate job that I hated. I knew that I was about to be made redundant and I was trying my hardest to achieve that goal. I didn’t know what I wanted to do but I knew I wanted to do something I enjoyed, something that gave me satisfaction, something that would challenge me.
Someone, who wasn’t a web developer, recommended a book to me. I was considering a few potential career areas but after a few months of post-redundancy partying, I recalled the name of the book. I forget it now – it was by Sitepoint – and it was a beginners book.
At the end of following the book (which probably took me 6 months – it shouldn’t have!), I had a very basic website, from a HTML page, a CSS page and something called a responsive CSS page which I hadn’t understood at all.
It looked crap but I had understood a fair bit of the semantics of it, certainly HTML. Given how awful it looked, I decided without any guidance to learn Photoshop.
I bought a book and merrily (and slightly less slowly) ploughed through it until I had a basic grasp of Photoshop. I still didn’t understand how to make my website look modern and respectable.
So I bought a book on design principles (The Principles of Beautiful Web Design). Which was interesting but didn’t teach me any code which I thought was odd. And then, when asking on a forum, I found out that web developers and web designers, terms which I had previously brazenly interchanged, were separate roles.
So I bought another coding book, this time again a fairly beginners book on making a website with just HTML and CSS. And when I had finished it, I followed some more wise advice from a forum which was to build my own website. I didn’t do much in terms of changing the structure, but I changed some of the styling and et voila, I had a half decent website. Well, half decent if it was 2008 as opposed to 2013 but at least it was responsive (ie positioning of structure changes for mobile/tablet).
It was around this point where I discovered the existence of online courses – if you are getting bored already, the list of the courses that I have completed are at the end.
I was also the point where I stopped partying every single weekend – ie the beginning of starting to put the necessary effort in. Codecademy was a bit of a revelation, although when I was going through their HTML/CSS courses, I found that I did know most of it already – but it was useful reinforcement. I particularly appreciated the instant feedback as to whether something was right or wrong.
It was there that I first ventured into JavaScript – another world entirely from HTML/CSS. Following the JavaScript course on Codecademy was at times difficult, it being my first taste of it. I followed this up by buying a large book on JavaScript for Beginners, I forget who by. I followed that through, sometimes by typing into my console, but I didn’t really understand the point of the console.
I did also buy a book called Learn JavaScript In A Weekend, or something similar. I can confirm that I did not learn JavaScript in a weekend. 2 years later and I am comfortable with the basics.
Unfortunately the more I learned, the more I realised I had to learn. It seemed as though the list was becoming endless – jQuery, PHP, WordPress, Angular, React, SEO, Node, Express, SQL, Amp, animations…it was quite ridiculous, and I’ve only mentioned those that come to mind right now. Not to mention just how difficult JavaScript is. And everyone I spoke to online had a different opinion of what I should learn.
I had to make sacrifices. 10 hours studying a month was not cutting it. I set myself a strict target of 10 hours every week:
Or something like that. If I only did 5 hours in a particular week, then the week after I would have to do 15. Granted I often had a backlog of around 60 hours but then I’d take some holiday from work and clear it. Yes, much of my holiday was spent learning to code too – not just weekends and evenings.
I also started some courses on Khan Academy on a variety of subjects. First I did the JavaScript one, which confused me at first as they used processing.js which includes various inbuilt functions not naturally available in JavaScript.
I started with their Intro to JS: Drawing And Animation course, which was fun as I got to use JavaScript through drawing on processing.js which is more interesting than learning JavaScript abstractly – though as I mentioned, that they use processing.js did cause some confusion when I later tried my own vanilla JavaScript projects and tried drawing shapes! Why isn’t rect(0, 20, 10, 20) giving me a rectangle?
They also had a course on making websites interactive, along with two more difficult ones, neither of which I have completely completed (almost!) on games and visualisations, and my favourite, which was natural simulations.
In fact, I enjoyed Khan Academy so much that I even went over their HTML/CSS courses to see if their was anything I have missed, and their SQL/jQuery courses too. The ones that are taught by Pamela and… oh gosh, I’ve forgotten her name, are compellingly taught in a quirky and fun way – I think I fell in love with both course-masters at some point.
Not everything I enjoyed so much. I signed up for a 6 month free version of Pluralsight, but found their teaching more monotonous – with little chance of evaluation and it was often difficult to follow – as I always re-code everything on a course, on my computer.
CodeSchool I also took up the offer of a free month, and a half price month, and did some of their HTML/JavaScript courses. The JavaScript ones had quite a steep learning curve. I’m not entirely sure why I did the HTML/CSS ones as by this point I was pretty on the ball with them.
I may have signed up to pay for CodeSchool, it certainly had promise, lots of evaluation points, some form of community and a very wide range of courses taught (probably too many as by this point I was signing up for courses on all kinds of things that I didn’t need to do).
But then I discovered Free Code Camp. So this was around December 2015 and it was my aim to have my first junior web development role by the end of 2016. Granted this wasn’t my first targeted date – I had previously said end of 2014, 2015, beginning of 2016 yadda yadda. But now there was a plan and a true focus. Free Code Camp was about to really help me.
I started on the easy tasks – it doesn’t teach a lot of HTML or CSS, so I wouldn’t advise starting with Free Code Camp – learn your HTML/CSS skills elsewhere.
It doesn’t even teach JavaScript that thoroughly – it certainly teaches you the fundamentals and enough to do some reasonably powerful coding. Again, previously mentioned sites will teach you more in depth – they all have their strong points.
But where it excels is in both the algorithm and project sections. The algorithm challenges really do make you think about how to use JavaScript, how to structure it, when to use chaining, if statements, for loops, etc. My ability to use JavaScript improved significantly thanks to Free Code Camp (admittedly I’m still years and years away from those £100k a year jobs) – most other courses on other sites either asked questions, or asked you to fill bits in. This was thinking about a challenge from top to bottom.
Then they have projects. For these, you have to write a website – the most basic being a tribute site, which I did to a footballer, Dean Windass. That was quite simple HTML and CSS.
They do go up in difficulty as you pass the JavaScript challenges, most recently I was working on ones using APIs – such as a current weather website. APIs are not taught well in Free Code Camp so it was a case of investigating – though they also have an excellent forum where I did ask for help on a few occasions, and am sure I will do again! Also you can see what other people have done with their sites, which I try not to do unless I am really stuck – though there is always a myriad of different ways to solve them.
So, that was pretty much me for the courses side of things, whilst I was learning how to become a web developer.
Now I have a job, for which I need to learn PHP and WordPress (quickly!), I am using Lynda, which is a subscription service (my company pays) and they do have some excellent courses on PHP and WordPress – something not easy to provide via something like Free Code Camp due to the local testing environment required. It is a whole other world. Lynda provides a set of videos, the courses are often quite long, longest I’ve found so far is a whopping 14 hours, but generally in depth yet comfortably so. I haven’t done their videos on HTML, CSS or JavaScript and probably won’t, certainly not HTML/CSS. They are excellent to follow along to, making websites from stratch or re-designing them and normally give you challenges too. You can see my collection of Free Code Camp projects here.
I do stress the sacrifices that I’ve had to make along the way. There were a few occasions were I just wanted to jack my dull accounting job in, with no money saved in the bank, and just concentrate on studying. Maybe I could have taken a bank loan. It would have been a lot quicker to have been studying/coding full-time.
But I couldn’t really risk not having an income, so studying part-time on the weekends, in the evenings had to be the choice. So many social events, so many parties, so many cultural events that I could have gone to that I had to turn down. I needed to get fit but had no time for that. I was often very tired. I ended up drinking too much Red Bull (counter-productive on tiredness). I didn’t get to watch cricket often, drink beer, sit in the sun, go for walks in the country, go to the theatre, go to comedy shows, go to nightclubs, go on weekends away, get behind my DJ decks, do any art, etc etc. Occasionally, yes, but nowhere near as much as I would have done otherwise.
And now I have my junior role, complete with significant pay cut, I cannot afford to do them! Plus, I’m only at the beginning of my journey and now have even more to learn just to keep my job, let alone progress.
Next up I will discuss the other reading materials and useful sources that helped me along my way, followed by websites that I made to go towards my portfolio, and in the final post I will discuss how I approached the job application stage. Hopefully I will write them before I am looking for a new job – things are somewhat precarious.
Here is the list of courses that I completed (or nearly), prior to being employed – those in bold are those I definitely recommend to beginners:

Now it may have escaped some peoples attention, but I like Goblins. Of all the many Goblins that have been released into the wild to cause mischief, I really like the old Great Goblin/Gnoll range produced by Citadel in the early to mid 1980's. And I feel I have neglected my Goblins for far too long.
Unlike later 1980's Goblins and beyond, which I still like, the Great Goblins/Gnolls have in my eyes a special charm and character about them. The Great Goblins/Gnolls seem to have more a 'civilised' looking (well most of them, but more on that later) feel to them, more akin to a Goblin version of Hobbits, with their better looking clothing and more 17th/18th Century feel. They remind me of Brian Froud's Goblins, and of course 'Hoggle' from the Labryinth (which Brian Froud worked on).
Anyway, I always liked the range and have endeavoured to buy them, both at the time when they were available, and since, including when they pop up on e-bay. However when putting them into regiments I felt that they never really got the credit for their individuality which I felt they deserved. Also I have been aware that I tend to batch paint masses of troops, rather than always take the time on miniatures. So I have decided to embark on this particular project of spending a little more time on these Goblins. I might still take on other things to do, time allowing, but will keep treating the Goblins with more time and attention. Incidentally, I have this crazy notion of naming each of these Goblins, and painting the names on the base edges!
The idea is to base the Goblins on 30mm round bases, which are a lot bigger than the normal 20mm for Goblins. By doing this I feel that I can give each model the space to explore its individuality, and allow for a much better decorated base, something which I have wanted to do for a while on miniatures. I feel the 30mm base is good medium between being a display base and a skirmish size. For the Boar Riders I plan to use 40mm bases and the few Trolls and Giants I'll include I'll use 50mm bases.
I kind of cheated a little. I worked on four Goblin which were already painted, but I went back and re-did/updated some of the paint work and of course, re-based them.
I ended up painting him up as an older looking Goblin, with grey beard and eyebrows. He looks like he is considering things more than your average Goblin. He has a slightly muddy cloak as well.
The big plant on the base is a 'Butterbur' from the 'Noch' range, more details of which futher down in this update.
I placed him slightly to one side of the base to allow the use of a plant, to seem like he is walking around it.
In the 1st Edition Warhammer supplement 'Forces of Fantasy' it suggests that the Great Goblins dress in dark colours. However I wanted to make them have more of a fairytale fantasy vibe, and so have gone for brighter colours.
Side/rear view showing more colourful Goblin clothing and a log on the base (left over from my Autumnal Wood Elf project).
I have filled the gap between the solid base on the goblins and the lip of the base with Millput. The lipped bases allow for the solding base to be lower down and not so prominant. I will on some of the bases add dips and water filled puddles.
Those of you familar with this range might have noticed I have'nt as of yet painted or based up any of the 'long eared' Great Goblins/Gnolls, such as those above.
I have a plan for these. As they are bare chested, wearing leggings and what looks like a kilt, and seem different in style from the other Great Goblins/Gnolls, I am going to paint these up with a slightly Scottish vibe, with plaid clothing and blue warpaint.
They come in sheets, and just pop out and then you squish them into shape. I include the 20mm square base for scale.
I do have another couple of packs of model flowers in the post from e-bay. I can recommend looking at model railway plants etc as they can be suprisingly interesting.
I still have all manner of bits, flock, and random items for which to add to bases. I even have a 28mm metal goat to add.
A wonderful project/mission, Goblin Lee, and one that I am excited to watch unfold. Of all your marvellous armies, it is your Goblins that I most admire. Everytime I visit your site I always linger over the top blog-header photo enjoying the massed ranks of goblin goodness. And the great Goblins/Gnolls are so terrific and underappreciated and too rarely seen on the Blogosphere, so it will be a great joy to see your collection as they all get special treatment and attention.
Thank you, glad you still enjoy the Goblins on the header, they make me smile everytime I log on to my blog :)
I do feel I have neglected the Goblins for too long, and intend to rectify that now. You are right, the Great Goblins/Gnolls are an underappreciated range, and not seen often.
I think it might be because they are a very early range, and outside the late 1980's are, Also, not a lot of people collect them, especailly as they look quite different to the later Goblins ranges.
There are a few who snuck into the back of the army photographs in the 3rd Edition 'Warhammer Armies' book though :) .
Thank you, I have been wanted to spend some time getting back to the Goblins, and spending some more time and care on each one. I thought the 30mm bases would help with that, allowing more detailed bases. I think there are too nice a range of miniatures to just end up in ranks and files.
I absolutely agree with Private W. and Mr A. above - looking forward to seeing these little fellas get some love. Great work on the basing by the way.
I really wanted to spend more time and effort on the bases, as well as taking time on the painting. Glad you liked them.
As I mentioned above they are a great range, full of indiviual character and charm (and mischief no doubt!) and so deserve some individual time spent on them.
Thanks for this post - you have just crystallised thoughts that have been lurking in my subconscious for a long time. I've been collecting a few of these critters on and off for a while, but not quite realising why I was drawn to them!
Cool, glad you hear you enjoyed the post and it's given you some ideas on what to do with your Great Goblins/Gnoll.
They are an usual and charming range of miniatures, and you're right they do have something about them . It will be good to see what how you end up painting them.

From the first page, you’ll be hooked into this hilarious and seasonal novel. As a reader, you can empathise with Clara, the main character. It’s 23rd December, and she’s running around doing last minute shopping on Oxford Street, trying to make the perfect Christmas. After a telling dinner party, in which everyone seems to have some sort of awakening and massive revelation, Clara’s life changes once again.
The book explores some of those deep-seated inner feelings that most of us try to keep at bay. Are we happy with our lives? Why does everyone else’s life look so perfect from the outside? What if I did this instead of that? There are several poignant moments in the book, as Clara’s life dramas unfold, you can see your own.
Written with humour, care and attention, Knight understands the beauty of realistic dialogue, which keeps the pages turning. She also does wonders with the internal monologue. Dissecting the meaning of love between spouses, siblings, children and parents, it’s a tender and earnest story. With the run up to Christmas upon us, it’s a perfect read or an even better stocking filler.

If you work in the HR industry, there’s a good chance that you’ve heard something to the effect of “the annual performance review is dead” discussed among your colleagues. The trend toward moving away from annual performance reviews began to ramp up in 2015, when a small but prominent list of large corporations began making headlines for abandoning the practice.
Noteworthy companies that discontinued annual reviews over 2015-2016 include IBM, Cigna, Accenture, General Electric, and Deloitte. Other prominent companies, including Microsoft, Adobe Systems, Juniper Networks, Motorola, and Gap, Inc., began phasing out annual performance reviews as early as 2011. According to management research firm CEB, the trend is growing. To date, 6% of Fortune 500 companies have moved away from using annual reviews to evaluate employees and 70% of companies are currently in the process of deliberating whether performance reviews are the best option for their business.
If you’re a business owner or HR manager that conducts annual performance evaluations of your staff members, this growing trend may leave you wondering whether you should follow in step and reexamine your own review process. Many HR professionals become wary at the very thought of abandoning a well-established review process that provides them with tidy metrics for performance. So, then, why are so many companies rethinking the practice? To better understand the trend, it may be helpful to take a look at the overall advantages and disadvantages of annual performance reviews.
For decades, the standard annual performance review process has seemingly worked for the majority of businesses, whether large or small. This may be because:
How would a manager determine whether an employee is improving, regressing, or remaining stagnant over time without utilizing some kind of benchmark analysis? Relying on memory or “gut instinct” is unlikely to provide reliably accurate data, and employees would likely assume bias was involved under such a system. And what happens if a manager or supervisor leaves the company and is replaced mid-year?
Questions like these tend to come up when a company is contemplating making changes to their review process, and for good reason. Many argue that keeping a solid benchmarking system in place ensures fairness and consistency.
Performance is difficult to describe consistently, as every manager naturally has a different voice and approaches description differently. Without a standard rating scale that is consistent company-wide, employees would be left at the whim of their specific manager’s style of describing performance.
By using a set rating scale, managers and supervisors can accurately document performance rather than relying on their own subjective comments and descriptions. This results in reviews that are quantifiable, and therefore fair, rather than being completely open to varied interpretations.
Despite the widespread popularity of annual performance reviews, recent data from research firm CEB indicates that 90% of managers and supervisors are dissatisfied with the way their companies currently carry out annual performance reviews, and nearly 90% of HR leaders hold the opinion that the annual employee review process does not yield accurate information. Additionally, according to data collected by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), 44% of employees surveyed felt that their manager or supervisor was being dishonest during their annual performance review. These statistics certainly appear to indicate that something is not working properly under the current annual review system. Commonly cited problems include:
Many employees report feelings of anxiety and resentment surrounding the annual performance review process. Even high-performing employees tend to dislike the annual review process and find it unfair. As a result, reviews that should ideally motivate employees can instead actually harm employee performance and employee-manager relationships.
According to CEB research, managers report spending an average of 210 hours a year dealing with activities related to annual performance management. The same managers estimate that their employees each spend 40 hours a year on such activities. And with 90% of HR leaders holding the belief that reviews deliver inaccurate information, having to spend so much work time on the process can be understandably frustrating.
It is fair to argue that there are clear benefits to maintaining an annual performance review process of some kind:
Alternatively, statistics and company trends indicate that there are significant drawbacks to the annual performance review system:
In the end, it is up to individual business owners and HR managers to evaluate the pros and cons of conducting annual performance reviews at their own companies. Deciding what is best for your business can be made easier by keeping up with the latest industry trends and monitoring what actions larger corporations are taking and what results they get from these actions.

“It’s a wonderful turnout today to see a lot of wonderful people from the Latino community, from the Gainesville community in general, too,” said festival coordinator Victoria Condor-Williams.
About 80 people wove between tables of food and wine as they waited for the opening speech by Adrian Felix and the screening of “La Mission,” the first film of six to be shown during the following five weeks.
Felix, a post doctoral associate for the Center for Latin American Studies, said he intended to speak about three issues in his preface to the film, touching on the Mexican-American or “Chicano” culture, sometimes spoken of as a gang culture; sense of homophobia and machismo pervasive in Mexican-American culture; and, finally, the setting of the film, The Mission District in San Francisco, and its history of immigration.
“Latinos are a heterogeneous, internally diverse group. I think that oftentimes people perceive Latinos as a monolithic panethnic culture, when in fact there’s a lot of internal diversity,” Felix said.
Maria Quintana, financial coordinator for the festival, said she was proud of the diversity in the crowd that showed up.
Peter Crosby, coach of the Guelph Hurricanes, arrives in Stratford for Friday’s hockey game against the Cullitons. He questions how his rival and the league handled a rape scandal.
[Update: On October 16th, Peter Crosby resigned as coach of the Guelph Hurricanes. In a message he sent to this reporter minutes before his team took to the ice that evening, Crosby wrote, “I’m stressed out…I’ve been soul searching for a while now.” He said the team was struggling to find enough players to fill out its roster (“this has become a health and safety issue”). As well, he’d become concerned about his own behaviour (“I’m snapping at my players and my coaching staff — officials, too — and that’s wrong”). When asked if he encountered any problems because he spoke out about the league’s handling of the rape scandal involving his rival, the Stratford Cullitons, Crosby said, “I haven’t had any problems with that. The decision to resign was mine.”]
Stratford, Ontario — A top junior hockey coach wants to know why the governing bodies for his sport have not questioned officials with the Stratford Cullitons for what he calls a “homegrown” investigation into a rape scandal.
Peter Crosby is the head coach for the Guelph Hurricanes. His team competes against the Cullitons in the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League. The GOJHL is governed by the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) and Hockey Canada.
In an exclusive interview, Crosby said he was “shocked” that board members with Cullitons got away with what is being called a “sham” investigation into a rape scandal that has rocked this southwestern Ontario city.
The case involves Mitchell Vandergunst, a former player and assistant captain for the Cullitons. In July 2013, he was charged with three counts of sexually assaulting a woman. On October 3, 2014, he was found guilty of two of the charges. The judge described his crimes as “predatory.”
Vandergunst was allowed to play with the Cullitons the day he was found guilty. Coincidentally, he played against Crosby’s team, scoring a goal to help the Cullitons defeat the Hurricanes.
“I had no idea about [Vandergunst’s] crimes,” Crosby said. “I didn’t hear anything about it until I read about it the week it broke wide open.”
Vandergunst continued to play for the Cullitons for four months. He was finally kicked off the team, but only after the father of the rape victim called a local newspaper, on January 30th of this year, to expose the convicted sex offender.
On February 3rd, Vandergunst was sentenced to a one-year prison term plus two years’ probation. (In an August 21st email, Vandergunst’s lawyer, Mark Halfyard, confirmed that he is appealing both convictions.)
Three days later, on February 6th, the president of the Cullitons, Dan Mathieson, told reporters that the team’s head coach, Phil Westman, knew about Vandergunst’s sex crimes but did not know what to do with the information. Mathieson said Westman offered his resignation willingly.
Mathieson also claimed that none of the team’s approximately 35 board members and staff, including himself, knew they had a convicted rapist in their midst.
Mathieson is also the mayor of Stratford. He was running for re-election last fall while Vandergunst’s trial was going on.
In June, Mathieson surprised Cullitons’ fans, sponsors and the local media by announcing that the Cullitons’ board of directors had hired a private eye firm, Eagle Investigations, to investigate the rape scandal.
A source who spoke on condition of anonymity because of close ties to the team said, “Mathieson and his buddies on the board hired a bunch of private dicks to snoop around town, and no one knew about it?
According to Mathieson, the Eagle investigation “found exactly what we said,” that everyone connected to the team was in the clear — except the coach. He added that a “small number of players” heard rumours about Vandergunst’s crimes but did not want to pass on the gossip to team officials because of their loyalty to the sex offender.
One of the more curious findings in the Eagle report states that an investigator interviewed Scott Farley, the CEO of the OHA. The report does not explain the purpose of that interview or what questions Farley was asked.
“I don’t get why the OHA is being investigated,” he asked. “Shouldn’t it have been the other way around? Why wasn’t the OHA asking the questions?”
Before agreeing to an interview, Crosby said he wanted to be clear that his views do not necessarily reflect those of the Hurricanes organization. But the successful hockey coach, school teacher and father of teenaged daughters said his league “needs to talk openly about what happened in Stratford because there are lessons to be learned here.
“A player in [our league] was convicted of sexually assaulting a woman. We’ve heard very little from the powers that be. Where is the OHA? I honestly thought they would investigate what happened [and that] new policies would come down, but we haven’t heard anything.”
The OHA governs junior leagues in the province. From the start, Farley seemed unsure what his office would do about the scandal. He was non-committal during a radio interview on the same day Vandergunst was kicked off the team. Towards the end of the interview, Farley said, “I wouldn’t call this a crisis.”
Farley resigned suddenly last month. It is unclear if his departure is linked to the Cullitons’ scandal. His replacement, Mark Ellis, has ignored repeated requests for comment on whether or not the OHA is investigating the cover-up in Stratford.
As for the sport’s highest office, Hockey Canada, one of its vice presidents, Glen McCurdie, declined to answer questions about whether or not he plans to take action.
Crosby said he respects the Cullitons because of the team’s rich history and winning ways. He described his rival as “a model franchise [but] what happened in Stratford, and the way the OHA has handled it, has given the league a black mark.”
Crosby said he has no axe to grind with the Cullitons, but he described what he called “an interesting experience” with Mathieson earlier this summer.
“I re-tweeted a story about the Cullitons,” Crosby recounted. “Sheldon Kennedy was quoted in it. I thought maybe other people in the league might want to read it.
“Next thing I hear, Dan is upset with me for sending out the article. He wants to talk to me. But my general manager told Dan he didn’t see a problem with what I did.”
Mathieson has refused to answer this reporter’s questions since the scandal broke last winter. Earlier this summer, he was replaced as president of the Cullitons. It is unclear if he stepped down on his own or was asked to leave.
Crosby said a positive that has emerged from the Stratford scandal is his rival’s new policy to have players and coaches attend a workshop that addresses sexual consent. He says he plans to do the same with his team.

The Utanian Bureau of Census, which ran a census over the month of January, finally declared today that the population of Utania was a confirmed 46,218,400 people. The country was divided into 2,339 sub-divisions and the population analysed. A chart showing the population density is attached.
The national population growth rate since 296 has been 2.98% p.a., an astounding figure. The return of expatriate Utani, including at least 350,000 from South Bay, is one known cause, though no detailed figures are yet available on that subject. Furthermore, deliberate mis-counting by Guwimithian census-takers may be a second cause, as they were embarassed at the number of Utani kept repressed in the dependencies and sought to keep the ratio of Guwimithian to non-Guwimithian high.
This reduction of the Utani population may have been particularly the case in Utani B'yan, where official statistics to date have indicated a population of seventeen million. The Utanian census says 20.6 million, a 20% increase in a matter of four years, a feat unlikely to have been achieved simply by births. Over the whole country, the population increased by just under 3% p.a. or 12.5% for the past four years.
For earth comparisons: USA = 28 people per sq.km; Germany and UK = 240; Chile = 40; France = 100; Hong Kong = 5,800; Earth in total = 46.
Actually for the few I could find numbers for, Vexillium appears light on people, compared to earth.
Oh, Winfried, I calculated Feniz to be roughly about 0.5 x 225 miles x 350 miles or 101,981 sq.km. - you've got a very nice map going there, too, btw!
The census has not completed its analysis on many other fronts, including employment and other economic statistics, but preliminary results already indicate massive unemployment is gripping the country, as many as three million people unemployed, or 13%. This adds yet another challenge to the President's plate.
- Utan Krysaror grew by 800,000 people to 4.7 million in the past four years, a massive 4.7% annual growth, which may have indicated massive migration from country areas, however, that same growth rate is across the entire state. This indicates substantial population growth, which would see Utani B'yan state reach thirty million people in only eight years, and under-counting by the Guwimithian regime, which may have wanted to reduce the official number of Utani in their dependencies.
- Mulgrave becomes the sixth largest city in Utania, and the largest of the so-called "second-tier" cities. It almost doubled in population to 380,000 people, making it the fourth largest city in Utani B'yan, and second largest in many manufacturing industries.
- The large cities continue to dominate Utani B'yan state, with 8.7 million people living in one of the three major centres: Utan Krysaror, Agraam and Shecker. Urban living in Utania overall stands at twenty million in cities, and another six million in suburban small towns. The remainder mostly live in traditional communal villages.
- The Savana east, which sits on the side of the central mountains of the country, has increased substantially with increasing levels of industrialisation. A marked increase in tribal Viranese, Ujam, Ramal and Nystos immigrants to that region indicates it wealth in terms of manufacturing jobs. To the east coast, it is a source of cheap, reasonable quality consumer goods. The Bureau indicates this will be one of the fastest growing regions in the country. It is also where the Savaj Netopik corporation is based. The capital of the region, Utan Savaj, now has 270th residents. Savana recorded the highest proportional increase in urbanisation.

First, it is wise to stick with a company that specializes in HVAC services. While many general handyman companies may do some things with AC units, a company that specializes in air conditioning and heating is always a better option.

Routine maintenance involves replacing or cleaning the filters if so equipped, and keeping the outside air intake free of debris.

Our crew members have both the knowledge and expertise to ensure that every heating and air conditioning unit, no matter the make or model, is running at peak performance.
Before you reach out to local HVAC companies, jot down a few notes. Know the model of your unit and see if it’s under warranty. If so, call the manufacturer first. Then, get multiple quotes for the project in question. Never get less than two quotes for any home remodeling project. Once received, compare all and make sure all include the same work. Check referrals and certifications before making a final decision.
If you need a furnace repaired or an air conditioner serviced, we'll send a local technician out to diagnose the specific problem and recommend solutions for you and your family. There will be a diagnostic fee for the visit, and any specific repairs will be an additional charge. If replacing your system is the best solution, the fee for the diagnosis will be credited toward the purchase and install of a new system.
Should you experience a system breakdown, know that there are a few common causes of summer AC repairs. Below you’ll find a few of the most common ones AC repair technicians face each day throughout the warmer months. Having a better understanding of the troubles your system may face can help you feel more at ease with the AC repair process, and better comprehend the information given to you by your technician.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that all technicians who open a system containing a controlled refrigerant be certified to do so. There are four levels of certification, one of which is a “universal” certification to allow the HVAC technician to work on any type of equipment containing refrigerant. Your HVAC technician should be certified as “Level II Certified” at a minimum or, preferably, “Universal Certification” to work on your central air conditioner. Obtaining this certification information from your professional HVAC technician may be required in the event you are working with a realtor to sell your home. Costs for certification average $40-$240.
The condensed, pressurized, and still usually somewhat hot liquid refrigerant is next routed through an expansion valve (often nothing more than a pinhole in the system's copper tubing) where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure. That pressure reduction results in flash evaporation of a part of the liquid refrigerant, greatly lowering its temperature. The cold refrigerant is then routed through the evaporator. A fan blows the interior warm air (which is to be cooled) across the evaporator, causing the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture to evaporate as well, further lowering the temperature. The warm air is therefore cooled and is pumped by an exhaust fan/ blower into the room. To complete the refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant vapor is routed back into the compressor. In order for the process to have any efficiency, the cooling/evaporative portion of the system must be separated by some kind of physical barrier from the heating/condensing portion, and each portion must have its own fan to circulate its own "kind" of air (either the hot air or the cool air).
In modern buildings, the design, installation, and control systems of these functions are integrated into one or more HVAC systems. For very small buildings, contractors normally estimate the capacity and type of system needed and then design the system, selecting the appropriate refrigerant and various components needed. For larger buildings, building service designers, mechanical engineers, or building services engineers analyze, design, and specify the HVAC systems. Specialty mechanical contractors then fabricate and commission the systems. Building permits and code-compliance inspections of the installations are normally required for all sizes of building.
Fall is here and winter right around the corner which means soon you will be using your furnace day in and day out. With that said, you cannot expect your heating system to perform at peak levels and provide you with all the warmth and comfort you need if you do not take time out to schedule routine maintenance or an immediate furnace repair should you discover a problem with your system exists.
HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large industrial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and hospitals, on ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.

New residential central air conditioner standards went into effect on January 1, 2015; see the efficiency standards for central air conditioners for details, and consider purchasing a system with a higher SEER than the minimum for greater savings.

1) Your air conditioner is not working at all. Before calling in a professional to address this issue, you may want to check a few things yourself. Check to see if your thermostat is set to “cool”. Confirm that your designated cooling temperature is less than the temperature of the room or home. If everything is set correctly, check the electrical panel to be sure you do not have a tripped breaker. If these things all check out and your air condition unit is still not working, it is time to call in a professional.
Natural ventilation is a key factor in reducing the spread of airborne illnesses such as tuberculosis, the common cold, influenza and meningitis. Opening doors, windows, and using ceiling fans are all ways to maximize natural ventilation and reduce the risk of airborne contagion. Natural ventilation requires little maintenance and is inexpensive.[19]
In addition to air cleanliness, we provide expert services in air conditioning sales, installation, and maintenance, furnaces, heat pumps, packaged systems, and more. Chances are that if you have a concern when it comes to HVAC, we can solve your problem. Our technicians in Mableton will walk you through the service you need, how to fill your need most cost-effectively, and provide a 100% guarantee on the services we provide – each time.
If the AC doesn’t turn off, it may be time to clean the condensing unit. Dirty condenser coils won’t give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together—something that can happen over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick until you buy a replacement—which you should do soon.
Our Technicians are NATE Certified, licensed TACLA00078831E, and will arrive in vehicles fully stocked so that the repair can be done the same day. When it comes to system performance, we are the pros. We have had extensive training in residential and commercial air balancing which means we can dial in your system to perform at maximum levels. We specialize in home or business air conditioning service and repair.
HVAC services is our go to contractor when it comes to our HVAC needs. Back in 2013, we were dealt some unforeseeable home projects, as our HVAC was failing and needed to replace the whole system, e.g. Furnace, Blower, A/C, Condenser, Vents, etc... We reached out to a few HVAC companies (Contra Costa Heating and Air, EP builders, High Performance Heating and Air) so we could compare the bids for the job. We have had some issues with past contractors and after thoroughly screening a few of the above mentioned HVAC contractors, we awarded the bid to HVAC services because of their superior customer service and very reasonable pricing. From Day 1, Alberto walked us through the process, and present us with a variety of options based our budget for the project. His customer service is the best as he did not oversell any services and did not nudge us towards buying a unit that would stretch our budget. On installation day, HVAC Services sent out a crew of 6-7 guys, all of whom were very polite and kept their work areas clean, and installed the whole system the same day. Although it's been 2 years since we have had the HVAC system installed, HVAC Services continues to provide great customer services, coming out semi-annually to check on the HVAC system and adjusting the airflow within the house. Definitely recommend them!!!!
Your HVAC professional can also help you verify that your system is properly matched by providing you with an AHRI Certificate of Certified Product Performance upon request. The certificate verifies that the outdoor unit (condenser) and the indoor unit (evaporator) combination has been certified as a matched system by the Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI). For higher efficiency systems, this certification may help you obtain a rebate from your utility or local municipality, if you have to replace your unit in whole or in part. Not all areas offer a rebate, but your technician will likely be able to provide information about the certification process. Fees for performing this certification vary, but generally are relatively inexpensive.
“We had a great experience with Robinson’s! The office staff, then the gentleman who helped me with questions over the phone and Kyle, our service tech, were all great and very easy to work with. They gave me a time frame for when to expect Kyle the same day. A phone call to let me know he was on his way. A text with picture so I knew who to be expecting. Kyle arrived on time and was very knowledgeable and friendly. He did a great job. You could tell he liked his job. Prices were reasonable. We will be using and recommending Robinson’s Air – Wichita Falls in the future.”

The time it takes to install an AC unit and the associated cost depends on the square footage of your home.

- Discharged due to promotion from Quartermaster's Dept (Regular Army) on Aug. 12, 1864, (Prior service in US Army since 07/01/1841)
Recommended Reading: Winfield Scott Hancock: A Soldier's Life. Description: Hancock's Civil War generalship earned him the affection of his troops and the country's citizenry and the respect of his fellow officers, all of which were sustained and flourished during his post-war career as a Reconstruction military administrator, a Great Plains Indian overseer, commander of the Military Division of the Atlantic (states), during which time he earned the gratitude of the nation in quelling labor violence, and, finally, as a three-time seeker of the Democratic nomination for President (1868, 1872, 1880) and his party's nominee for that office in the 1880 election. Continued below...
David Jordan's WINFIELD SCOTT HANCOCK is an extensively referenced, solid, immensely readable biography and work of popular history. Jordan obviously thinks highly of the man. Even Hancock's less than illustrious stint as commander of the Military Department of the Missouri from August 1866 to August 1867, during which he stumbled around the Great Plains without a clue as to the nature and culture of the Indian tribes he was tasked with controlling, goes pretty much 'uncriticized.' After all, Hancock was only following the orders of his superior, General Sherman. And that's what Winfield did best all his life - follow orders.
Recommended Reading: Winfield Scott Hancock: Gettysburg Hero (Civil War Campaigns and Commanders Series) (Hardcover). Description: Perry Jamieson's Winfield Scott Hancock: Gettysburg Hero is an enjoyable edition to the Campaigns and Commanders Series, published by the McWhiney Press. Jamieson tells of Hancock's remarkable career in entertaining and exciting prose and remarks on his legacy and current reputation among historians. Although this biography would appear brief to those not acquainted with the series, it is actually one of the longest yet published. This series is meant to give a shortened yet informative account of Civil War figures and events to those not yet familiar with them. Jamieson gives an outstanding portrait of Hancock as a genuine military hero and analyzes the role he played in saving the Union. Continued below...
For those who would want to learn more, he lists several extensive and acclaimed biographies of "Hancock The Superb." The maps and biographical sketches included are a great aide to those without prior knowledge of Civil War figures. Jamieson tells not only of Hancock's role in the war (although he does, of course, focus on it) but also recounts his admirable postwar service on the frontier as well as his failed presidential campaign. Also of note is the mention of the history behind the most famous Hancock monuments and memorials, including both the statue atop Cemetery Hill and in Washington DC, as well as others. This book is an excellent introduction to one of the finest commanders in American military history. It combines solid research and storytelling in an effective manner and does justice to the man and his memory.
Recommended Reading: Commanding the Army of the Potomac (Modern War Studies) (Hardcover). Description: During the Civil War, thirty-six officers in the Army of the Potomac were assigned corps commands of up to 30,000 men. Collectively charged with leading the Union's most significant field army, these leaders proved their courage in countless battlefields from Gettysburg to Antietam to Cold Harbor. Unfortunately, courage alone was not enough. Their often dismal performances played a major role in producing this army's tragic record, one that included more defeats than victories despite its numerical and materiel superiority. Stephen Taaffe takes a close look at this command cadre, examining who was appointed to these positions, why they were appointed, and why so many of them ultimately failed to fulfill their responsibilities. Continued below...
He demonstrates that ambitious officers such as Gouverneur Warren, John Reynolds, and Winfield Scott Hancock employed all the weapons at their disposal, from personal connections to exaggerated accounts of prowess in combat, to claw their way into these important posts. Once appointed, however, Taaffe reveals that many of these officers failed to navigate the tricky and ever-changing political currents that swirled around the Army of the Potomac. As a result, only three of them managed to retain their commands for more than a year, and their machinations caused considerable turmoil in the army's high command structure. Taaffe also shows that their ability or inability to get along with generals such as George McClellan, Ambrose Burnside, Joseph Hooker, George Meade, and Ulysses Grant played a big role in their professional destinies. In analyzing the Army of the Potomac's corps commanders as a group, Taaffe provides a new way of detailing this army's chronic difficulties-one that, until now, has been largely neglected in the literature of the Civil War.
Recommended Reading: Generals in Blue: Lives of the Union Commanders (Hardcover). Description: More than forty years after its original publication, Ezra J. Warner’s Generals in Blue is now available in paperback for the first time. Warner’s classic reference work includes intriguing biographical sketches and a rare collection of photos of all 583 men who attained the rank of general in the Union Army. Here are the West Point graduates and the political appointees; the gifted, the mediocre, and the inexcusably bad; those of impeccable virtue and those who abused their position; the northern-born, the foreign-born, and the southerners who remained loyal to the Union. Continued below...
Warner’s valuable introduction discusses the criteria for appointment and compares the civilian careers of both Union and Confederate generals, revealing striking differences in the two groups. Generals in Blue is that rare book—an essential volume for scholars, a prized item for buffs, and a biographical dictionary that the casual reader will find absorbing.
Recommended Reading: Civil War High Commands (1040 pages) (Hardcover). Description: Based on nearly five decades of research, this magisterial work is a biographical register and analysis of the people who most directly influenced the course of the Civil War, its high commanders. Numbering 3,396, they include the presidents and their cabinet members, state governors, general officers of the Union and Confederate armies (regular, provisional, volunteers, and militia), and admirals and commodores of the two navies. Civil War High Commands will become a cornerstone reference work on these personalities and the meaning of their commands, and on the Civil War itself. Continued below.
Errors of fact and interpretation concerning the high commanders are legion in the Civil War literature, in reference works as well as in narrative accounts. The present work brings together for the first time in one volume the most reliable facts available, drawn from more than 1,000 sources and including the most recent research. The biographical entries include complete names, birthplaces, important relatives, education, vocations, publications, military grades, wartime assignments, wounds, captures, exchanges, paroles, honors, and place of death and interment. In addition to its main component, the biographies, the volume also includes a number of essays, tables, and synopses designed to clarify previously obscure matters such as the definition of grades and ranks; the difference between commissions in regular, provisional, volunteer, and militia services; the chronology of military laws and executive decisions before, during, and after the war; and the geographical breakdown of command structures. The book is illustrated with 84 new diagrams of all the insignias used throughout the war and with 129 portraits of the most important high commanders. It is the most comprehensive volume to date...name any Union or Confederate general--and it can be found in here. [T]he photos alone are worth the purchase. RATED FIVE STARS by americancivilwarhistory.org
Recommended Reading: Generals in Bronze: Interviewing the Commanders of the Civil War (Hardcover). Description: Generals in Bronze: Revealing interviews with the commanders of the Civil War. In the decades that followed the American Civil War, Artist James E. Kelly (1855-1933) conducted in-depth interviews with over forty Union Generals in an effort to accurately portray them in their greatest moment of glory. Kelly explained: "I had always felt a great lack of certain personal details. I made up my mind to ask from living officers every question I would have asked Washington or his generals had they posed for me, such as: What they considered the principal incidents in their career and particulars about costumes and surroundings." Continued below…
During one interview session with Gen. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Kelly asked about the charge at Fort Damnation. Gen. Chamberlain acquiesced, but then added, "I don't see how you can show this in a picture." "Just tell me the facts," Kelly responded, "and I'll attend to the picture." And by recording those stirring facts, Kelly left us not only his wonderful art, but a truly unique picture of the lives of the great figures of the American Civil War. About the Author: William B. Styple has edited, co-authored, and authored several works on the Civil War. His book: "The Little Bugler" won the Young Readers' Award from the Civil War Round Table of New York. He is currently writing the biography of Gen. Phil Kearny.
Today the lovely people at Gifts4Gifts have sent me a Bomb Cosmetics Love Rocks Gift Set* to review! I haven’t had a bath in ages (that sounds really gross doesn’t it!) Our bath doesn’t get very hot so I just use the shower 🙂 So I’m really looking forward to having a nice relaxing bath and trying these products out!
The gift set comes already wrapped in pretty paper and a bow, ready for you to give as a gift – or unwrap yourself!
Summer of Love Blaster 160g (A strawberries and cream fragrance with vetivert and patchouli essential oils)
So I ran a bath – and added two kettles full of boiling water! And I used the Love Buds Bath Mallow. I had the most relaxing and lovely scented bath (with a g&t, just to add to the relaxation) the Mallow took a while to completely dissolve, but I like that, watching it rolling around and fizzing in the water 🙂
Next up I think I’ll try the Feel The Love Creamer, I really like the sound of that one! For the price of £14.99 (making each product less than £3 if you count in the packaging) I think this gift set is fantastic value for money, as a treat for yourself or as a gift 🙂 xxx

"Despite the documented evidence of chess historian H.J.R. Murray, I have always thought that chess was invented by a goddess." George Koltonowski, from Women in Chess, Players of the Modern Game
As I was updating myself on the news after a brief nap this early afternoon, I came across a short article at Yahoo News showing a slide show of photographs from the celebration of St. Anthony's Feast Day in Spain, who is the patron saint of animals.
The hand of Santiago Fulero, Major priest of the Saint Pablo church, blesses people with their pets outside of the church, during the feast of St. Anthony, Spain’s patron saint of animals, in Zaragoza, northern Spain, Wednesday, Jan.17, 2018. (Photo: Alvaro Barrientos/AP)
There is a tradition of blessing animals on this day in Spain and some rather bizarre rituals as well, such as riding horses through fire for the benefit of the smoke which is somehow thought to protect them then through the rest of the year. Perhaps a modified version of the "Aryan" horse-sacrifice ritual where the queen then had intercourse with the dead horse?
Anyway, this led me to thinking about the dog-headed saint that I've written about before, but I couldn't remember his name. So I did a quick Google search to refresh my memory and lo and behold, up pops a lot of information about an Orthodox icon, St. Christopher (dog headed human), St. Guinefort (a greyhound patron saint in France - brutally suppressed by the Fake Male God Enforcers during the Inquisition) and about a dog-headed RACE of people, I'm not kidding. Now, honestly darlings, I don't recall at all reading about a dog-headed RACE of people before; I remember reading about the dog-headed saint and writing about him; and I may have read about a poor greyhound dog being made a saint in France but not writing about HIM (why would I not have done this, I'm asking myself???), so I guess last time I wrote about a dog-headed saint I didn't do very good research, or something, hmmm.
But Holy Hathor, what a fascinating subject! What is so bitterly ironic about this is that DOGS are the ancient companions of the Great Mother Goddess. They were thought to be the harbingers and also cleaner-uppers (is that a word?) of Death and always accompanied the Great Mother Goddess during her walks across the Milky Way or the Primrose Path or Route 66, take your pick. Modern thought also suggest that it may well have been women who domesticated the first wolves into the dogs we know and love so much today, in various places around the world, at various times, some as far back as 16,000 years ago somewhere in the vast plains of Mongolia, but also independently in the ancient Middle East. I think it's still unclear; not sure I buy into the "happened in several places more or less at once (archaeologically speaking, that is) in several different areas around the world" hypothesis. What we continue to push back in time is just how old evidence of the domestication of dogs is!
I'm not going to go into a long, wordy and overblown exposition on these various dog people/dog saints themes - you can read easy :) But if you want to do some reading on your own, here are some links for your perusal:
Cynocephali in the Ancient Christian Tradition, Scott Nevins, March 10, 2015, from Scott Nevins Memorial
St. Guinefort, Wikipedia entry. The patriarchal storm god haters of the Great Mother Goddess are much in evidence in the account of the "killer mothers" of their babies. Note in the account that the dog was buried in a well and surrounded by trees to set up a shrine that people came to. Now please - if this doesn't sound like a sacred Goddess grove complete with sacred spring and her faithful companion buried in her sacred space, what does? Heeellllloooooooo....
I am intrigued by the reference in the account of passing a baby nine times through an opening between the trunks of two trees in the "wood of Rimite" -- not sure if this means the woods (location, area?) were called "Rimite" or the particular spot where the babies were allegedly passed between two trees nine times was called "Rimite." I cannot help but wonder if there is some connection between this word (Rimite) and a name in a much earlier document from the second half of the 9th century CE, an Orthodox elder by the name of "Rimbert," as referenced in Scott Nevins' "Cynocephali in the Ancient Christian Tradition" (linked above).
Could it be that Inquisitioners, who were Roman Catholic, had come across earlier references to Rimbert in either reading or hearing something about inquiries being made on "dog-headed" people many years prior? Could "Rimite" have been conflated with "Rimbert" and then ridiculous stories made up about Satan seducing women (always women, NEVER men) into killing their own babies to fire up prejudice against uppity women? I wouldn't put anything past those corrupted rotten dudes in the so-called "holy church" back then. I should point out that the Inquisition first broke out in France in the 12th century CE in response to what was seen as encroachment on their territory (conveniently called "heresy") by Cathars (which preached equality of females, among other things anathema to the Men in Purple), Albigensians and Waldensians. St. Guinefort is a localized French saint, never officially recognized by the Roman Catholic Church.

I'm one of the founders of Goddesschess, which went online May 6, 1999. I earned an under-graduate degree in history and economics going to college part-time nights, weekends and summer school while working full-time, and went on to earn a post-graduate degree (J.D.) I love the challenge of research, and spend my spare time reading and writing about my favorite subjects, travelling and working in my gardens. My family and my friends are most important in my life. For the second half of my life, I'm focusing on "doable" things to help local chess initiatives, starting in my own home town. And I'm experiencing a sort of personal "Renaissance" that is leaving me rather breathless...

But what does it really mean and how do we know its existence? Can we actually perceive it? And more importantly, how can we be so sure that we are not imagining it?
We hear that grace is God or Guru’s blessing in an imperceptible form that protects or bestows us with goodness. For example, a miraculous escape from an accident may lead us to think that it was only the Lord’s Divine Grace that saved. But then it could also be pure luck or some may even think that we deserved it due to our good ‘karma’ of the past. So what is the truth? Was it grace that saved us or karma?
It is only the Guru who gives clarity to this mystery. It’s important to understand the nature of a Guru to decipher this. An uttama (pure) Guru doesn’t perform miracles. He doesn’t give us a million injunctions to follow. He never says a negative word. And despite being hounded by thousands of us, with numerous queries and problems, He still has time for each and every one of us.
He works day and night to transform us – our thoughts, passions, actions and reactions, our indulgences away from the world and towards the Lord. Yet He doesn’t lay any claim to that at all.
It’s simply because He genuinely cares. He genuinely cares about each and every one of us. ‘But why?’, continues our mind which has never seen or heard someone like this out in the world.
There’s no mystery here. The answer is that that’s just the nature of the Guru. With that there can be no more questions, for do we question why a flower is fragrant or a snake poisonous? A Guru’s love is truly unconditional, even superior to a million mothers, for a mother needs the connection of ‘her’ child to express the love.
When such a Guru comes into our lives, can we ascertain this to any karma? It is not possible for us to ‘do’ anything to earn this unconditional love on us. So there certainly has to be something else that’s establishing the circle of influence.
So long as we think we ‘deserve’ and ‘control’ our destinies, the system will not interfere. So, in the past, it would have been true enough that we were meant to be saved in that car accident.
But when a Guru comes into our life, His unconditional care makes us automatically thankful. With gratitude, flowers a new kind of perspective that we are in His care and control and whatever happens is through His protection. The feeling of gratitude ripening over time results in complete surrender. Fleeting moments of gratitude leads to fleeting moments of acceptance of His Grace. As mahans would say, “Grace is always there. Are you ready for it, is the question.”
Now what happens is that whether we are saved in the accident or not, we will still deem it Grace. And just that simple change in approach will make us very positive. While in the past, all ‘negative’ endings would have made us sad and depressed, being under the umbrella of a Guru, even a ‘negative’ result (from the outside world’s perspective) would have no bearing on the disciple.
For His ways would mean that this sequence of events is the best for us at this point. Perhaps it is to wash off some karma; perhaps it was in lieu of saving us from an even worse incident; perhaps it will open new horizons of opportunities. But the truth is, it actually doesn’t matter why! It only matters that it was the Guru’s will.
When such surrender ripens, we get a great comfort that “there is someone to care for me and I don’t need to worry.”
This change in thought process is in fact the standing proof of the presence of “Grace”, because we did nothing to invoke this. It happened because of gratitude to unconditional love.
The beauty in this is that, even this realization credits only the disciple and not the Guru, for without gratitude and surrender (disciple’s attributes), the love of a Guru will not reflect in the disciple’s eyes as Grace. But this is only because they (the Gurus) simply don’t want any credit.
However, let us realize that it is indeed only His compassion that makes us the vessel for receiving His Grace.
Every day, the world is moving further and further away from God. New generations are growing up without believing in God's work. We hope you will help us to change that by donating as much as you can so that we can keep finding and sharing each miracle that God grants us.
By choosing to donate to Gods Real Miracles today, you are taking an active role in efforts to help promote Christianity, protect our kids, bring God's wonders into each home, and recover the amazement that God deserves.

For many, cycling brings to mind imagery of pedaling at extreme speed on a flat and well-paved road. But, it doesn’t always have to be this way. Taking your road bike to the dirt can offer some of the season’s most fulfilling riding, especially here in New England, where getting off the pavement can bring silence, beautiful foliage, and an experience that is usually unique to activities like hiking, climbing, and camping.
The bike I ride was built for the pavement and is by all means a conventional road model. Although it’s probably not the most ideal for riding dirt roads, it gets the job done. Some may argue otherwise, but when it comes down to it, you can throw any old road bike on dirt paths. It might get a bit dusty, and flats are possible, but this is also the case on the pavement.
This type of riding isn’t mountain biking, and it isn’t high-speed road cycling. It is something somewhere in between, where the enjoyment comes from seeing new places, feeling like you’re in the woods, or struggling through mental and physical challenges. These are the elements that make it so satisfying.
You don’t need to run out the door to buy a new dirt road-specific bicycle, either. A model like the Kona Esatto is an adventure machine that seems to have no bias about whether it is pedaled on a major paved route or a back road.
Breaking the monotony of the pavement and relishing in the pursuit of the dirt doesn’t take much besides a few essentials and the willingness to explore:
Usually, there are plenty of places to stop and fill up your water along paved roads, but when you’re out on the dirt, they might not be so easy to find. I typically bring two CamelBak Podium bottles with me on dirt road rides and store them on two frame bottle cages.
I store mine in a Timbuk2 seat bag, so I can put other things in the pockets of my bike jersey. My repair kit contains a CO2 tire inflator with a spare cartridge, a Topeak multitool, a spare tube, a small piece of an old inner tube for tire punctures, a pre-glued patch kit, and some toilet paper. If you’re having more bike issues than these items can handle, that’s an indication you’re having a tough day.
I tore off the southern portion of a Vermont State Tourism map (free at many gas stations), and find this to be sufficient for most of my riding. If I am looking to get more off the beaten path, I reference a Vermont atlas before heading out. Although I bring along a smartphone, having alternative sources like a physical map and a compass (mine is on my GPS watch) will always give you something to navigate with, plus the confidence to explore roads that maybe you’ve never been down.
When you’re riding on the dirt, distances can add up unexpectedly at times, and it is important to have enough fuel on hand to keep your engine running. Food—like water—is not always accessible when you’re riding on the back roads, and to prepare for this, leave with more than enough calories to sustain what you plan to do. It is best to bring along foods that your body can digest quickly, like Clif Shot Bloks or gels, as well as anything heavy in calories for your body to burn slowly, like a classic Clif Bar.
The Pearl Izumi Elite cycling gloves are long lasting and provide excellent grip and cushioning for long gravel descents. Going down dirt roads on skinnier tires is both exhilarating and challenging, so having good bike gloves can make a big difference.
Instead of using a bike computer, I find that, for touring-style dirt road riding, a GPS watch is a much better option. I use the Suunto Ambit3 Peak, which provides me with all of the information I need, including compass bearing, total mileage, and average speed. Afterwards, you can upload your ride to Google Maps through the Suunto Movescount application to see your entire route.
I put my phone, money, and map into an Outdoor Research Sensor Dry Envelope. You can still use your phone through the clear film, and because I just put the whole envelope in my jersey pocket, it keeps the contents dry from both sweat and unexpected precipitation.
The Giro Savant helmet with MIPS is an excellent choice for all types of riding, and is my go-to for road and mountain biking. It breathes well, is lightweight, and has a secure, comfortable fit. I never head out on my bike without it.
Smith Pivlock glasses are perfect for all types of biking. Pairs come with three lenses that can be easily interchanged, depending on the conditions. I find myself most frequently using the clear lenses for riding dirt roads, since they are usually well shaded by treecover. Wearing glasses also provides an additional element of safety by protecting your eyes from bugs, dust, and debris. An added benefit to the Smith Pivlock is that they seem to almost never fog up.
The Mountain Hardwear Ghost Lite Jacket packs into its own pocket and provides some added protection from unexpected winds and precipitation. When not in use, it can fit into one of my cycling jersey’s pockets, making the jacket an essential piece that adds a good deal of protection and warmth for minimal weight.
For me, the fall season in New England captures why I love living here, and pursuing the path less traveled by taking your road bike to the dirt is one of the best ways to experience it.

Prices here.
All Workshops are with a theme and have a durance of 2 hrs 30 min. I teach in English/German. In Frankfurt I offer two to three workshops a year. In my studio in Frankfurt Bornheim the classes are small and for up to seven students only. You can also book a workshop for your company. Or you plan to give a seminar and wish to enrich this with a yoga workshop for your students. Please look below for more workshops that can be booked. For informations about the location and prices plse klick here.
Backbends: Backbends in Yoga can contribute to get more drive in life. But not only that. It is preventive to backpain and rejuvenates the body, the mind and the soul. We practice backbends and experience pleasant effects like a win of energy, joy and a vitalization of our organs and of body regions we usually do not pay attention to. Especially as they are at the back, we tend to forget about them. This workshop is for yoga students with a minimum of 3 months yoga experience.
Basics: Yoga postures start at the soles. We practice postures (Asanas) en detail, paying attention to alignment of bones, muscles and ligaments, involving ourselves in an exciting process of increasing our awareness. It also gives an introduction to Pranayama and what exactly is the Iyengar style. This workshop is for beginners and advanced, who search a wellgrounded approach.
Dynamic Yoga: Who does not want to start the mornings with more energy? How can my breath be used for a plus of verve? Messing around distracts, gaining balance instead is fun! More dynamic comes from the ability to focus and leave out all that is non-relevant. And all this should be possible with Yoga? Try it out! It is an approach to become more dynamic and how our mind and soul are connected with our body. This new workshop Yoga Dynamic is for all students with a minimum of three months yoga experience.
Legs & Balance: They carry us day by day. Even when we sit, they are most important for a strong foundation. Their alignment is responsible for the position of our head and a great influence of our inner attitude. … the legs! In this workshop I will show asanas, that affect from the bottom to the top. How do we use our legs in the most effective way? How can we relieve them? How do we strengthen them? And how are we more centered in our total appearance? This yoga workshop is good for absolute yoga beginners, for higher levels of yoga practitioners as well as for dancers.
Link of Top & Bottom: What have the soles to do with the palate? In this Yoga Workshop we work with the focus on the very essential muscles, the Psoas. They connect the element water and earth, are the link between movement and stability and are the basics for a balanced top and bottom, our body and our mind. Good alignment with the Psoas effect the back (lumbar spine), diaphragm (breath) and the hips (stability), to list only a few aspects out of many. More consciousness about correct aligned asanas are the essence of this worskhop "Link of Top & Bottom" and is suitable for all with minimum one month of yoga experience and more.
Present & Focused with Yoga: In the workshop „Present & Focused with Yoga“ I demonstrate and explain, how to be more with Yoga in the here and now. We practice Asanas (poses) und Pranayamas (breath), to become calmer and more centered. How can I be more focused in the daily life and how am I not “drifting off” into yesterday or tomorrow? We learn to be fully present in our bodies, to experience our surroundings and our own state of clarity. Without being distracted or carried away by worries, stress, constraining ideas, concepts, restraints or emotions.
Relaxation versus Tension - How to handle Stress with Yoga: Stress is occuring in everday's life and is pretty normal in our society. It doesn't have to be negative stress alone. Stress means, that we are to confront a change in our life. Our sympathetic nervous system is activated. The Adrenaline level goes up, the heart beat is faster, sweat glands are more active etc. As long as it occurs now and then, it is okay. As soon as someone suffers from stress symptoms and when stress becomes a chronic issue, then it is high time to do something about it. In this workshop we learn how we gain a better awareness of stress symptoms and how to relax the body consciously.pdf-Documents for Home Practice
Shoulders & More: Who works at the computer or sits at a desk regularily, has to do something, to keep the joints in the shoulders flexible. In this forwards bending posture, muscle in the chest (e.g. Pectoralis) shorten and in the back (e.g. Trapecius) lengthen. With this imbalance we loose the flexibility in the shoulder joints and if it comes to the worst we feel a continuous pain from the shoulder to the finger tips. In this workshop you learn asanas and simple movements you can easily practice at home afterwards. This is a workshop for beginners and experienced yoga practicioners, who want to do something proactive for a healthy, unrestricted, free mobility of the shoulder joints. It is for all who want to continue or regain the skill to scratch yourself at the shoulder blades when you feel an itch at that very spot. For more informations as costs and directions click here
Use the Wisdom of your Body and Listen: Sometimes we run out of the house until we realize that we've left something behind! That happens when the legs are faster than the mind. Yoga means a bond of body, soul and mind. It brings together what belongs together. In this workshop we go into detail of basic yoga asanas (positions). We feel our fingertips, the shoulderblades or for example the inside of ours soles and listen to our body part by part. Well done asanas are the best preparation for a healthy body and a healthy mind. This workshop is for yoga beginners and advanced.
My technique of instructions is very precice and I fully apply the technique of B.K.S. Iyengar. I explain and show all asanas. My instructions are very accurate and malpositions are adjusted by me. Doing Iyengar Yoga the focus is on alignment. When joints and bones are aligned, muscles are less tense and function better. All parts in the body are supplied with sufficient blood and nutrition, nerves get back in positive resonance. Yoga stimulates your glands and organs in a gentle way and effects your emotional stability. Sudden impacts and long term changes can be created by practicing 15 minutes a week!

Sam was the eldest of five children born to Jewish parents in Kozienice, a town in east central Poland. His father owned a shoe factory and his mother cared for the children and the home. Kozienice had a thriving Jewish community that made up about half of the town's population.
1933–39: On September 1, 1939, German troops invaded Poland. That morning the Spiegels heard an air raid siren blaring and quickly left their house. Fifteen minutes later a bomb struck the building. Sam was just 17 years old. After German forces occupied the town, they began to quickly implement anti-Jewish policies. Jewish schools were closed, intellectuals were arrested, and gold, furs, and other valuables were confiscated. Individuals disobeying such orders were severely punished.
1940–45: In 1940 Sam's family was forced to move into the Kozienice ghetto, a six-block area of town enclosed by barbed wire. Poor living conditions and overcrowding there—it housed some 5,000 people—led to disease and death. Sam was assigned to forced labor. In September 1942, he was transported to Pionki, a forced-labor camp that produced munitions. Three days later, Sam learned that the Kozienice ghetto had been liquidated and its inhabitants, including his family, deported to the Treblinka killing center. In 1944 he was deported to Auschwitz and transferred to its subcamp of Gleiwitz.
In January 1945, as the Soviet army approached, the SS began evacuating prisoners from Gleiwitz. After four days on the death march in the freezing cold, Sam arrived at Blechhammer, a subcamp of Auschwitz, where the prisoners temporarily rested. That night he and some other inmates escaped. After hiding in the woods for about ten days, Sam was liberated by Soviet troops.

Its back The old thread was old and out of date..so I will be producing a ongoing thread which we will update as and when we create more info.
SKY HD - £150 from Sky (£60 install for exisitng, £30 for new customers). £75 from a retailer, install charge still applies.
All broadcasts at the moment are done in 720p, if you have a 1080 set then you can take advantage of the 1080i setting as it won’t have to downscale the picture to your TV’s native resolution.
For a set to be 1080p ready it needs to have a native pixel resolution of 1920x1080. A list of 1080 ready sets will be listed further down the page.
Pixel resolution – This is the amount of pixels on your TV screen, the more pixels the sharper the picture (in theory) though manufacturers now add their own picture elements (bravia engine/ pixel plus/ XD engine etc) which enhances the picture further.
Contrast Ratio – This determines the sharpness of the picture, the higher then number then the sharper the picture tends to be, blacks will look very sharp and whites will be nice and bright, low ratios tend to create ‘washed’ out looks and the colours can ‘bleed’ into each other.
When buying a new HDTV you have probably looked into the different contrast ratios on each set. However, you need to be careful when looking because many LCD TVs will quote dynamic contrast ratios whereas plasma screens will quote native contrast ratios. So this is where big LCD manufacturers (Samsung started it all off) have been misleading the customers with these high numbers.
They will start with a black screen with the backlight dimmed right down and end with a white screen with the backlight turned right up to full brightness. This measurement between the two will determine the dynamic contrast ratio.
The native contrast ratio is measured with the white and black on the same screen so backlight control is not a factor.
Typically an LCDs native contrast will be around 1200:1 - 1500:1. Whereas a plasma screen will be between 10000:1 - 15000:1 (some new Panasonics are 30000:1).
In general plasma TV’s tend to have a higher contrast ratio which is why most of them give off a better picture when it comes to watching movies and darker programmes. Be wary of the specifications though as many companies use the wrd ‘dynamic’ which basically means the ratio isn’t what it says.
• Response rate can be dodgy, what this basically means is that if a programme is being watched that contains fast moving images, the TV can leave a kind of ghosting – that is the TV not refreshing the images fast enough. More sets are becoming available now though which deal with this problem.
• Contrast Ratio’s, which determine the sharpness of the picture tend to be considerably lower than plasma, what this means is that the colours can tend to look washed out, i.e. blacks look greyish and whites look dull instead of sharp.
• The screen is very soft like a PC monitor so if any of you have little children then it could be a cause for concern, they scratch and damage very easy.
• They can be quite poor for lower definition programmes, things that have been around for a while, because the programme wasn’t recorded with any new (ish) equipment, the image can look very pixellated.
• Excellent response rate means plasma TV’s are ideal for fast moving programmes like football and other sporting events
• The contrast ratio, unlike LCD’s tends to be much higher which result in much crisper looking colours, some of the top end TV’s (pioneer) standard definition images look amazing.
• The screen is very strong which makes the problems of tiny hands scratching the screen almost non existent.
• Increasingly limited choice, many manufacturers don’t produce decent plasma’s and have moved over to the LCD camp.
• The rear of a plasma can get exceptionally hot. What this means I don’t know but something to consider if the TV is being put into a corner or wherever.
Tweak it how? DO you still want the lists of TV that forumites have? It may take a while Ive got a lot of work to be doing and had a bit of home trouble, but it will appear.
I'd rather you got rid of the TV lists (They were useless). Keep the handy explanations of LCD and Plasma, and possibly do a roundup of the best TVs?
Cheers for bringing this back Glowy. I was gonna do last night but thought I would leave it to you, seeing as it's your thread!!

You could always keep them and hide them in one of the new 'condenser' boxes so then anyone who doesn't want to see them doesn't have to. Of course if no-one votes yes to them then you might as well chuck them!

Ah thats ok then. I'm crap at the arguing stuff as well, I just tend to keep quiet until it all blows over, usually works but not very fun.

I will use this as a quote next time people accuse me of trying to rip them off by recommending different cables, Ive had my screen clean for 18 months and its good stuff.

I was watching At Worlds End on it at work yesterday and especially on the dark scenes the Sonys completely break down and start displaying a very grainy image, whereas the Samsungs do not. The normal TV however is better on the Sonys still than the Smasungs. It just shocked me thats all.
As much as I love Pionneer its way too much money for what you get, unless you want the best best bestest piture Id go for the Panasonic PZ85.
Got it for £1300, so it was half the price of the pioneer. and I just couldn't see what souble my money was getting me.
The GF who was against the Pioneer from the start played the whole "you could get this one today you know!"
Splendid, its an awesome TV, do it a favour and put on a Pixar film through your PS3 or something too. Ive never seen an image so clear.
Yeah, I put Planet Earth on it yesterday and it looked great! no Judder that I used to get on my old TV. The picture so far has been phenomenal. Even normal Sky looks pretty decent, but Im going to have to upgrade to Sky HD at some point.
Do you know any good places I can go to, so I can change the picture settings to their optimal settings?
Any conversation about American inventors typically congers images of the likes of Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, and Henry Ford. This country was founded on great inventors and our tradition for encouraging innovation still makes us great. However, the process is tough and the odds of getting an invention to market are slim.
To learn more about the challenges modern inventors face I spoke with Akos Jankura, inventor, entrepreneur, and host of My Cool Inventions Radio. Jankura got his start as a chemist developing stain removers and laundry sheets. He eventually developed and patented his own specialized brand of laundry sheets that went on to sell millions. His passion for solving problems through invention led him to want to help other aspiring inventors. Jankura firmly believes “the best asset this country has is inventors.” However, the challenge these inventors and aspiring entrepreneurs face is a minefield of unregulated rip-off artists and scammers looking to take advantage of them. Jankura has seen far too many scammers prey on those budding inventors who have just given birth to their invention and are blinded by the prospect of getting their invention out into the world.
To help new inventors navigate the murky waters of bringing a new invention to market he launched My Cool Inventions Radio. The show is somewhat of a cross between Shark Tank and American Idol where inventors come on free of any charge and present their products to a national audience where listeners will vote on the viability of the product and provide real feedback to the inventor. When it comes to avoiding common pitfalls, Jankura advises new inventors to consider the following:
Stop and Learn: Just as in any business endeavor, you must educate yourself. “I wouldn’t tell someone to jump into a pool if they didn’t know how to swim,” says Jankura. The reality is lack of knowledge can put a new inventor at a tremendous disadvantage because it makes them vulnerable to scammers. Due diligence is important. Be sure to check out trade associations, industry publications, and online resources before making the plunge.
According to Jankura organizations such as the Electronic Retailing Association, RESPONSE Expo, and USPTO seminars are great places to get information about the process of getting an invention to market.
Connect with the Right People: Jankura likens the inventing process to mountain climbing. “If you are going to climb Mount Everest you will need a guide” says Jankura. You will need an advisor with experience, someone who will help you avoid the traps of scammers. However, you must be deliberate in who you connect with. There are scammers out there who will claim they can get you access to key players or will claim their own affiliations and status will open doors. Jankura advises against paying for this type of access. Take your time and get to know the players before making any commitments.My

Without saxophonist Dean Fraser's urging, Tarrus Riley would not have recorded Beware, the song that ended up as the third track on his 2006 VP Records album Parables. The song of caution to the innocent to keep an eye out for the wanton killers is recorded on the rhythm that Half Pint did, Political Friction, and Riley was unhappy with singing on a riddim that had already been used.
Political Friction, is on Half Pint's album, In Fine Style, as well as the Sly and Robbie Live 86 set.
"At the time, I was so much into my own music, I did not want to get a riddim to go on. I was into guitar and piano. I was singing Lion Paw and Pick Up the Pieces (both of which are also on Parables)," Riley told The Sunday Gleaner. And Fraser advised, "Tarrus, we need this for the balance. You have to meet the people half-way."
So Riley, who said, "that time me have orchestra and some big arrangements in my head," listened to the riddim that was being played at Grafton Studio in Vineyard Town as they spoke. Fraser also gave a lyrical direction. "Him say we need to talk about what is going on," Riley related. And violent crime was rampant, as it is now.
It starts with a news clip about a youngster being shot, and Riley says that it is a direct reflection of the influence the current events have on the song.
With the song recorded, Riley says he moved on to creating the next song. The impact of Beware hit home when it was being played on radio, Riley saying that IRIE FM's Elise Kelly was one of the persons who put it into prominent rotation. "People called in the day," Riley said, their excitement building.
Beware became a part of Riley's set and is part of a vein of songs against violence which runs through his catalogue. In 2010, on the eve of the Tivoli Incursion, Riley recorded Protect the People.
"I was supposed to do a show the night, but it rained and the show was cancelled," Riley said. He ended up at a music studio and the reasoning was about the impending security forces operation.
"Everybody was on edge," Riley said. One person said that the good will suffer for the bad and Riley said, "protect the people, Jah". That became the nucleus and refrain of the song, the video for which was shot across Kingston in the streets.
Now this year, he has released Graveyard, an outright warning to those who would consider themselves bad. After getting the riddim from Russian, Tarrus, his brother, and Craigy T were talking.
"Every man a put in a line," Riley said. "To me, we find the hardest line." And that is the turn in the song as after identifying some areas reputed to be high on the 'badness' chart, Riley asks, "which part have the most gunman?"

Unlike national brands, Vital Choice canned Albacore Tuna is cooked only once, to preserve its fresh flavor, firm texture, and healthful omega-3s. In addition to ample protein, Albacore provides omega-3s in abundance, and substantial amounts of vitamin D.
All Vital Choice Albacore comes from a North Pacific fishery in which smaller boats line-catch individual tuna using the sustainable troll method, which ensures careful handling of each fish, safety for dolphins, and very minimal bycatch.
* Certified sustainable by Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) Thanks to its sustainable harvest and lower mercury content, albacore from this fishery is categorized as “Super Green” by Monterey Bay Aquarium. Vital Choice has this to say about their Albacore Tuna: "[It] is sustainably harvested by our neighbor Paul Hill, who quickly flash-freezes it on his small boat to preserve the fish at its peak of freshness. Because predatory fish such as tuna accumulate mercury over time, Paul provides us with younger, smaller Albacore tuna (14 lbs. or less) for optimal purity."
Vital Choice premium quality Portuguese Mackerel comes from a family that has been picking and packing the finest fish for more than 100 years, selecting the fattiest, tastiest mackerel and processing and cooking them with the care needed to ensure fine flavor and texture.
Vital Choice Portuguese Mackerel is delicious added to salads or sandwiches or eaten right out of the can.
*NOTE: Unlike King Mackerel, which pregnant and nursing women are advised to avoid, Vital Choice's Atlantic “chub” Mackerel (Scomber colias) presents no safety concerns, as it is an entirely different species with very low levels of mercury.
These succulent treats come from a Portuguese family that's been perfecting their craft for more than 100 years. Just for Vital Choice, they custom-pack Sardines harvested when levels of omega-3s and flavor reach their peak.
These premium Sardines are packed in certified-organic extra virgin olive oil, rich in antioxidants and flavor.

This is their Traditional Style Wild Red™, which includes skin and soft edible bones, to offer extra flavor, calcium (12% Daily Value per serving) and omega-3s (804 mg per serving).
Wild Sockeye salmon is specially selected, fully cooked and ready to eat. It’s a delicious, healthy choice that’s packed with flavor and omega-3 nutrition.
In addition to ample protein, Alaskan Sockeye salmon offers abundant omega-3s, as well as unrivaled levels of vitamin D and astaxanthin (as-tuh-zan-thin), a carotenoid-class red-orange pigment with rare antioxidant power.
Omega-3s – About 997mg of omega-3 EPA+DHA, or 2 to 4 times more than the minimum daily EPA+DHA intake recommended by most world health authorities (250-500mg)).
Vitamin D3 – About 585 IU in the optimal D3 form, which is more than most other fish, and more than any fortified food, approaching the child-to-adult US RDA of 600 IU.
Astaxanthin – About 3.39 mg. This red-orange pigment is a carotenoid-class nutrient with unique health benefits.

The red shiso leaves give the distinct red color and flavor to the Umeboshi Plums; they sit together for months in the pickling bucket. After the aging process is done, they take them out, sundry them, and make into a delightful condiment.

Thrift Store Cowboys fourth studio album Light-Fighter (out October 12) could be called their post-arson period, as Daniel Fluitt and band wrote the record after a stranger torched their gear and merchandise-filled trailer parked next to Fluitt’s bedroom, nearly taking his life. Produced by Craig Schumacher (Calexico, Neko Case, Iron and Wine) Light-Fighter’s indie rock shapeshifts through ambient and Gothic western music for songs that touch on death, loss, fear, redemption, the Spanish Civil War and West Texas ghost stories. All buoyed by soaring violin, draped against bottom-ended guitar and pedal steel sounds that spaghetti western composer Ennio Morricone might envy.
The Lubbock based sextet, which includes Fluitt, Colt Miller, Clint Miller, Cory Ames, Kris Killingsworth, and Amanda Shires on fiddle and vocals, have been touring together for a decade after meeting at the musical South Plains College. They are neither of the typical Texas-based types of bands – a country-rock mélange or strictly indie rock. As Buddy Magazine points out, “Thrift Store Cowboys' feel is more, for a lack of better description, gypsy desert music - the free sound of spacey, heat-induced delirium…a sure, confident sound backed by thoughtful vision.” Schumacher produced their 2007 release, Lay Low While Crawling or Creeping, of which Austin Sound said, “the album is to country music what Jim Jarmusch’s film Deadman was to the western.”
“Probably one of the most uplifting songs I’ve ever written in my life,” says Fluitt of the billowing lead track “One Gentle Inch to Nine Violent Miles,” about “that moment that you stop staring at the ground in strife and disbelief.” It’s followed by “Bright Fire,” a jangley roots rocker. But the western spirit starts creeping in with the felon-charged “7s and 9s” and then significantly on the haunting “Scary Weeds,” penned and sung by Amanda Shires, who started as a sidewoman at the age of 16 with the legendary Texas Playboys and released her own solo album West Cross Timbers last year. She also contributes the begging and beautiful “Lean Into the Sway.”
As for ghost stories, Fluitt wrote the epic “Nothing” about a division of Buffalo Soldiers in the late 1880s, in pursuit of attacking Comanches, who knowingly led them in disorienting circles around a buffalo-grassed and treeless flatland to die of thirst. Fluitt interestingly “takes this story as a call and response, between a dead soldier and his wife, showing the tribulations each had, him on the plains, and her at their house. Both were left with nothing.”
Fluitt also explores the Spanish Civil War via a character from The Cypresses Believe in God, by Jose Maria Gironella for the song “You Can’t See The Light.” “In the book, ‘Caesar’ who was studying to be a priest, was imprisoned by the Anarchists, and in strange twists, he was executed instead of rescued. This was the first song of a concept album I hope to write about the trilogy of books.”
Thrift Store Cowboys have been slogging out consistent touring with growing audiences for 10 years, but historically most young bands implode at year three, crammed in a smelly van together. This band makes it because they “keep growing and changing musically,” says Fluitt. True too, they initially and wrongly got lumped in with the Texas country-rockish bands that essentially write the same songs over and over again, but ducked that subset pretty quickly. They met Schumacher while playing with DeVotchKa, says Fluitt, and did both Light-Fighter and Lay Low While Crawling and Creeping at the heralded Wave Lab Studio in Tucson.
For the new record, “we tried to capture the dynamics of our live shows.” As well the band up until now, has been doing everything 100% themselves -- and for this record they are working with TopSpin, as well as indie distribution and marketing. “It’s like getting to the top of a mountain and finding a 300-foot wall, you gotta throw a rope over to help you get to the other side,” says Fluitt. Thrift Store Cowboys kick off a month-long tour on West Coast in September, and will be on the road all year in support of Light-Fighter.
On Monday, June 24, 2013, the U.S. Senate passed a cloture motion (which ends debate) on the Schumer-Corker-Hoeven Amendment to the Gang of Eight’s horrifying illegal alien amnesty bill – mislabeled “immigration reform.”
The true purpose of this amnesty proposal is to capture future votes for the Democratic Party. Those who do not acknowledge that blatantly obvious fact either suffer from some debilitating mental illness or are working for the other side.
On rare occasions, even the Left admit the objective. Eliseo Medina, the honorary Chair of the Democratic Socialists of America, and International Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), said in 2008:
…If we reform the immigration laws, it puts 12 million people on the path to citizenship and eventually voters. Can you imagine if we have …even two out of three, if we get 8 million new voters… we will create a governing coalition for the long term, not just for an election cycle.
The “governing coalition for the long term” refers of course to the “permanent progressive majority” Democrats have fantasized about for decades.
The number of illegals in this country is repeatedly cited as 11 million. This is almost certainly an underestimate. In reality the number is 20 to 30 million or more, according to a 2007 study in Social Contract. Bear Stearns estimated about 20 million in 2005. When amnesty passed in 1986, official estimates were 1.2 million illegals. There were actually 2.7 million – more than double. Within ten years, INS estimated the illegal population had grown to 10 million. It is delusional to believe the number has only increased by another 1 million in the 17 years since. Furthermore, when amnesty passes, the newly-legal aliens will invite their relatives to come, further inflating that number through chain migration.
Herein lies the real reason Democrats are slavering for this amnesty bill to pass and are tickling themselves pink that there are Republicans stupid and gullible, (or corrupt) enough to help them realize their dream. And make no mistake, an increase of 30 million in the Democrat Party voter base will guarantee Democrat majorities in the U.S. House, Senate and Presidency for the foreseeable future.
Despite the impossibly bizarre belief by some Republicans that amnesty will make illegals “like us,” a high level Congressional source recently acknowledged to me that passage of this bill will spell the end of our Republic and that we literally have only weeks to stop it. Despite House Speaker John Boehner’s somewhat ambiguous assurances, this bill is likely to get a vote in the House.
The original Gang-of-Eight bill was really bad, as became readily apparent quite quickly. The overtly fraudulent Schumer-Corker-Hoeven Amendment was offered as a fig leaf to reassure fools that the original bill — which already promised in-and-of-itself to enhance border security – would actually enhance border security. But in reality it makes things worse. The amendment:
Legitimizes illegal immigration: Section 2302 says if you overstay your visa in the future you can still apply for a green card and become a citizen. It is permanent lawlessness… They cannot do that legally under current law!
Has no requirement to deploy technologies: The Corker amendment would give the Secretary of Homeland Security full discretion as to how technology would be deployed, or whether it would be deployed at all.
Has no fencing requirement: Similarly, building a fence is left to the discretion of DHS. (Note: since a fencing law, with money attached, passed years ago, and has been blithely ignored by the Obama administration, the amendment simply codifies Obama’s open defiance of current law.)
Increases fees on visas for legal immigrants, but keeps the same low fees and fines for those applying for amnesty – favoring illegal over legal immigrants.
Under the Schumer-Corker-Hoeven amendment, the American taxpayers are on the hook for $38 billion. (The Gang-of-Eight claims the bill is fully funded by immigrant fees).
The Schumer-Corker-Hoeven Amendment, by the way, is one of the factors that convinced Bill O’Reilly to support this legislation. Bill reminds us of P.T. Barnum’s timeless adage, “there’s a sucker born every minute,” but only on Fox News does one get a prime-time show, and only in the U.S. Senate do they get hailed as “moderates.”
In a conference call Monday evening, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) said that most people don’t realize this bill operates in tandem with Obamacare and amounts to de facto affirmative action for illegals. He said that Obamacare will raise the cost of American citizen or legal immigrant workers by roughly $3,000, but the amnesty bill exempts illegals. This creates an incentive to fire legitimate employees or reduce them to part-time status and replace them with illegals.
He added soberly that if American people do not stand up now, no senator or group of senators has the clout to stop this thing from passing.
In this same conference call, Senator Jeff Sessions (R-OK) said that the Congressional Budget Office predicts the bill will lower wages and raise unemployment. He also said the bill doubles the number of guest workers allowed. Because approximately 40 percent of illegals here have overstayed their visas, this will increase the number of visa overstays.
Similar to Obamacare’s “Navigator” requirement, this bill contains provisions for funding leftwing ACORN-like “community organizations” to teach illegal aliens about citizenship and no doubt convince them to become good Democrats while they’re at it.
All illegals would be eligible for DREAM Act in-state tuition once their application has been approved and they become “provisional residents.”
The 1993 National Voter Registration Act, aka Motor Voter, calls for voter registration at public assistance, motor vehicle and other public offices, and allows groups like ACORN to engage in voter registration activities. Is there any doubt that these community organizations will take advantage of their taxpayer funded operations to register all these budding democrats once they become eligible? Will they even wait for that?
Of course all Democrats voted to invoke cloture on the amendment. Following are the mindless (or corrupt) Republicans who went along with them:
No matter what state you live in and whether or not your senators are Republican or Democrat, let them know just what you think of this lousy bill and their betrayal of the public interest: call 202-224-3121 and ask for your Senator.
Furthermore, sign Ted Cruz’s petition. About 100,000 have signed to date. Call and email Senators and House members. Urge your friends and neighbors to do the same. If this passes the Senate our last chance will be the House. We need to let them know now what we think.

“We did have communication issues [last week], but keep it coming,” linebacker Nigel Bradham said, via BuffaloBills.com. “It’s a bigger problem for them.”
Added defensive back Aaron Williams: “We want the fans to be as loud as possible. It may seem like it’s hurting us a little bit, but we’ll adjust.

Many people who study languages and want to become fluent or people who want to travel the world may have had the thought of traveling/studying abroad flow through their mind. There are many reasons to study abroad, but in this week’s blog I’m going to write about the 5 reasons to study abroad in high school.
Staying with a host family gives you the opportunity to be around the language and learn how to deal with communication barriers. While studying abroad in college you will most likely be place in dorms around other foreign exchange students. Though they may still be from other countries there may still be the possibility of not being around people who speak the language fluently.
When studying abroad you get to hear and see more world news then you would be if you were in the States. Though I have heard news on terrorists attacks from all over the world; I have yet to hear other news regarding countries besides my own. Also while studying abroad you get to experience a different culture then what can be taught in a classroom.
Whether you study abroad in college or in high school you will be gaining a better understanding of surviving on your own by learning to communicate with others, depending more on yourself, and adapting to your surroundings.
Studying abroad can help give you the extra help when applying for jobs that include international clients or any jobs in a traveling/ language field. To further explain, you will have a better understanding of the world and different cultures that will help you aid people in other jobs.
Now this is kinda self-explanatory, but it is a very good way to gather the language in a different setting than a classroom.
Overall, these are not the only reasons to study abroad and for sure aren’t all of them, but I hope these reasons will encourage others, like me, to explore the idea of studying abroad because an opportunity like this will change your life and give you a better understanding of the world you live in.

Fibonacci Sequence Documentary, Golden Section Explained - Secret Teachings The Fibonacci spiral is named after Italian mathematician Fibonacci. His 1202 book Liber Abaci introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics, although the sequence had been described earlier as Virahanka numbers in Indian mathematics. By modern convention, the sequence begins either with F0 = 0 or with F1 = 1. The sequence described in Liber Abaci began with F1 = 1. Fibonacci numbers are closely related to Lucas numbers. They are intimately connected with the golden ratio or golden mean; for example, the closest rational approximations to the ratio are 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, 8/5, ... Fibonacci numbers appear unexpectedly often in mathematics, so much so that there is an entire journal dedicated to their study, the Fibonacci Quarterly. Applications of Fibonacci numbers include computer algorithms such as the Fibonacci search technique and the Fibonacci heap data structure, and graphs called Fibonacci cubes used for interconnecting parallel and distributed systems. They also appear in biological settings, such as branching in trees, phyllotaxis (the arrangement of leaves on a stem), the fruit sprouts of a pineapple, the flowering of an artichoke, an uncurling fern and the arrangement of a pine cone's bracts. This movie also deals with the magical applications of the sequence, the pentagram or pentacle being a Fibonacci spiral borrowed directly from nature, and also many practical applications and mathematical ideas.

See and believe that stargazing in the matrix of reality its possible , the bing bang didn't happen this is proof, there is more that meets the eye I know what this is, an exactly what to do with it . A Lil explanation do you people know what this is? We'll I guess it goes like this '' its 2 sequences working together in zero time with no beginning and no end where. the end becomes beginning and the beginning the end the starting point is zero and the whole sequence becomes a giant equation for zero! Zero time!!! There is no starting point in consequence the universe falls in to the same rules Cuz whether you like it or not the universe is information trough numbers does it make more sense!?? And I believe starting point towards 360● 2 the 5th power its irrelevant Cuz starts from a determined point.! Same point of existance! But there is waaaaay more than meets the eye! If you are that someone you want to talk to me I'm the eschaton !! One thing I DO ask what is Hubble starting at? that means if I'm right! their spacecraft to mesaure the universe its not effective, The whole purpose is to explain the beginning of the universe. But how can you messuare the unmessureble? And how do they calculate the age of the universe by expanding theories, how can you travel to the stars if you can't understand the universe!?? I think its good to study Your star weather but to understand the cosmos nah it doesn't make sense besides what you get its only data and then what? you are gonna calculate a trip to planets ridiculous away from here!? I think that Millions are being wasted. Lots and lots of money!!! When I speak new technology I mean it. IM THE SCHATON. You talk to me!!!and if you do not believe then prove me wrong!!just dont say im crazy or wrong proof me wrong proofme!talking is cheap :-) But in the sequence it looks. Like human DNA with how many chromosomes??! Doesn't? But still that's just a clue come on teachers and professors look in to it!and tell me if the bing bang really happened!?I'm wide awake I dont need to pretent. One thing I do know E=Mc2 created atomic energy, ,for what to create atomic blasts all that energy wasted :-( Did you ever wonder what E = tb4 means!???? You talk to me and I'll prove you I'm a MASTER E=eschaton!!! I'm the eschaton you talk to me!!!!I can't believe you dont see them CLUES. Watch it with (i-son)!!!!or its the time to leave! 2013 the beginning of real space travel?But there is way more. Way way more. I. T.E if you had to build a machine before you build it you have to create the specs that fit the dimensions, the angles, the calibration of parts working together to create what you trying to achieve do you need money to use your mind? Or you use the equations of what is possible or not possible taking in consideration the physical laws and take the information of what is already there that you are trying to achieve well that's what people do they take in consideration the factors around them, terrain, resources, and from there they start making a plan, one thing is for certain maybe not everyone wants change but everyone wants POWER what Oil..? GAS, COIL, WOOD, NUCLEAR, SOLAR I KNOW THE POWER DELIVERED IN AN ATOMIC BLAST LIKE THE ONE IN HIROSHIMA WAS 4X2 10''15 JULES PEAK POINT FOR WHAT 15 SECONDS, please!! maybe some random guy out of nowhere can give you power but not limited or 15 seconds, nuclear plants are toxic, dangerous, expensive, the solution is in a mathematical equation that proofs it can be done a new form of energy. Zero point energy. It would not Work if the bing bang was correct but since its not correct its possible. And I can prove it. Yes. I found a sequence in the lottery that can increase your chances to hundreds of thousands but if you get 4 out of five its peanuts and you will end up in the cycle of chasing money to understand the lottery you have to understand time and when I Understood time I stop chasing the lottery and I found this . Zero point sequence that can give you power lots and lots of power. You just have to believe. But its easier said than done. But if its said it can be Done .you wont be able to prove my god wrong this is not mine it was given to me I just know what to do with it,This I promise in other words, I KNOW HOW TO BUILD STARS.I.T.E
I just found out about this today. Anyway, during the fight on Chapter 6-3, Wesker can do an insta kill move (Rhino Charge) by waving his hand. If you are close enough, this will happen... This sequence is similar to the Krauser Knife Dodge Sequence from RE4.

We have to learn to talk and communicate to nature and it's harmonic language and send loving intentions. Ancient Knowledge Consciousness By engaging our consciousness collectively by buying into all the fear, violence and sensationalism of the global media, we are reinforcing this disillusion collectively with 7 billion minds. Our consciousness is ultimately responsible for all. Secret Ancient Knowledge With all this knowledge and understanding we will be able to co-create a much happier Planet and preserve it for future generations. Ancient Hidden Secrets The Ancients knew much more than given credit for regarding Life, The Universe, Astronomy, Advanced Mathematics, Magnetism, Healing. Quantum Communication David Sereda Encoded knowledge is conveyed in signs and symbols and we can find this knowledge all over the world. All these ancient sightings and geometric patterns (Sacred Geometry) symbolize unseen forces. We Are Vibrational Beings The Ancients were not stupid or primitive. We just failed to de-code this knowledge conveyed in signs, symbols and ancient artwork. This kind of information is kept hidden from the public. Mind Science Kept Hidden Documentary Scientists don't know what holds the universe together, the answer is sound and unseen forces. Matter is governed by sound frequencies. There is much more to life than we can perceive with our 5 senses. The question then becomes "who or what governs unseen forces?" What is behind the symmetry throughout nature? (Golden Ratio, Phi, Fibonacci Sequence etc.) It simply cant be just coincidence, in my opinion there is an intelligent mind / consciousness behind all this that keeps it all together. Mind Science Quantum Communication explores how to create abundance in our lives by awakening the genius within each of us. How is quantum communication connected to the Universal Laws of Attraction? How do we manifest our future soulmates and business partners, and how can we become fully actualized human beings? What is actually happening when we pray? How do we create an intelligent dialogue with the creative force of the universe to allow us to experience a quantum leap in our own intelligence? Discover how to excel in your relationships, career and achieve super-learning to change your life and achieve a sense of self-actualization. Epegenetic Control Includes powerful insights from Dr. Bruce Lipton, Dr. John Gray and many other recognized authorities on the subject. Cymatics Documentary This extraordinary film by producer David Sereda, "Quantum Communication," explains how communication works from the Quantum level. We Are Vibrational Beings From our auras, to giving and receiving energy and a technology. Consciousness Science Kept Hidden The way we manifest abundance in our lives is to awaken the genius within each one of us so that we can excel in our relationships, careers and super-learning to transform our lives and those around us. This awakening of intelligence happens when we understand how "Quantum Communication" functions within each of us.

A couple of months ago I finally decided to bite the bullet and pay for Mint, a statistics package for websites. What? Yah, I couldn't believe it either, but you know I loves the numbers. $30, to be sure, is a lot to pay for what amounts to nothing more than a somewhat simplified stats program, but I love it. I love everything about it.
I'm not going to go into detail about the product, lord knows the blogosphere had its way with it when it was first released (mostly with regard to its admittedly high price), but I will say that I'm more than pleased, even if a bit miffed that I actually paid for it. It actually reminds me a lot of the old Reinvigorate system (which was *cough* free).
It's not Analog or Urchin (now available for free from Google Analytics), but it shows me the information that I want to see, and beautifully I might add.
I think my absolute favorite feature is the RSS feed for new referrers. No need to follow anything else; Technorati, PubSub, and all the other ways I used to track incoming links have been obviated. Shaun gets around the referral spam problem by "validating" every hit with JavaScript, which really seems to do the trick.
One other really nice feature regarding referrers is that it can usually deduce that different URIs are the same site (e.g., www.foo.com, foo.com, foo.com/foo.html) and record/present them as such.
The "Pepper" plugin interface is fantastic and as soon as I think of something I need that hasn't already been created, I'll be sure to release my own addition to Mint.
There is no way to filter the RSS feed. In other words, there is no way to remove from it things that come up often, but in slightly different contexts (e.g., I get a ton of referrals from Google Images which I couldn't care less about). Yes, I know of the Referrer Filter Pepper, but it only filters the page view pane, not the RSS feed.
Another thing I would like to see is the ability to switch between various color schemes. Sure, I could whip up a custom CSS file, but, well, I'm a busy man, and for $30 I would expect at least one alternative color combination.
All in all though, it's a great piece of software and something I see myself using for years to come.
Karen Umland at the DFA Emerging Markets Small Cap Portfolio Fund is slightly overweight India, and had 15 percent of holdings in Taiwan, over 14 percent in South Korea, over 14 percent in China, and 9.2 percent in Brazil at the end of Q1. Umland dislikes Russia and Egypt because of lack of market transparency and trading volume. Umland and co-manager Joseph Chi say companies with very low profits and high relative prices are chronic underperformers.
Patricia Oey at Morningstar said limited variation in country and industry weightings can hold back a fund so the DFA fund may outperform at times, and underperform at other times.

Andrea Guzzi at IST Investmentstiftung fuer Personalvorsorge said the global economy is recovering and healing, thanks to the US and the emerging markets – more people are becoming wealthy, less and less are poor. Guzzi said many countries have oversized banking sectors.
Christian Thwaites at Sentinel Investment says US companies have better profit potential, balance sheets and access to capital.
Two-thirds of investors see the global economy as either stable or improving. the most since May 2011.
The US offered the best opportunity over the next year for the eighth straight quarter, China ranked second, and the EU offering the worst returns.
Over 1 in 3 forecast say equities offer the best returns in the coming year, with real estate second, and bonds offering the worst returns.

Talk about an original art piece that 'pops,' this is definitely one . . . it's got some serious pizzazz, a funky, cool and unique wall sculpture. The abstract paintings on top in orange, yellow, and lime green have their own unique texture I created by painting many thin translucent layers of color, giving them dimension and depth. The colors remind me of a crisp autumn day, with bright sun striking the leaves, a glimpse of bright green still present.
This metal art is ideal for a contemporary office, whose simple modern furnishings need a little something on the wall to spice it up, a focal point of color and texture. It can hang in a vertical or horizontal orientation, one of the benefits of welding my own back frames, making it very versatile for any space form large office walls to small urban condos.

Merino/Angora/Alpaca blend yarn is 60% merino (extremely soft wool), 20% angora (bunny rabbits - they're shorn, like sheep are), and 20% alpaca. It is commercially spun, so I receive it as 8 oz. skeins, usually white, but now I also have had a batch of light grey spun, which made the blues, greens and grey color combination possible. I wash, mordant (that's what makes the dye color fast) and then dye it, using the same natural dyes I've always gotten such wonderful colors from. Many of the colors I ply together, changing one color at a time, putting in different amounts of color, so the stripes will be different widths. The other way I put the colors together, is to keep one color the same for the whole skein and just keep changing the second color, this makes the stripes more subtle. Either way, you still have a choice of the brighter shades, or the quieter colors. Also the amount of contrast between each 2 color combination will make a lot of difference in the overall brightness/quietness of the yarn. For yarn with the full rainbow, the amounts and shades of red and yellow are also a major factor of the overall bright or quiet look.
Since natural dye molecules are too large to penetrate the wool fiber and become a permanent part of the yarn, the color must be fixed in another way. The mordant sticks to the fibers and combines with the dye molecules, making a permanent bond with the yarn. I also get different colors by dyeing grey yarn, in addition to the white yarn.

By addressing our inquiry and practice towards the search of non-explicit relations between agents of a complex technosocial ecosystem, we aim to understand better the disanthropocentrificability of culture. Off-side relations that can perhaps be performed if we attend certain hidden ontological structures within those archival landscapes, inhabited by myriads of agents of diverse sorts (humans and non-humans). To look at them implies to find dispossessions, reassemblages and displacements of objectual agencies, and hence to test speculative infrastructures for other possible cultures.
The very basic toolkit and keywords we are going to use is articulated throught a methodologial triad: alien phenomenology / remediation / speculative fiction.
The result we look towards has the shape of a mediation infrastructure. Its basic features, are exportability to other archives and openness/availability to adapt to other specific contexts.

Sometimes in life we can't change our circumstances. When there is a situation we can't control and we feel helpless there is still one thing we CAN do. We can change our THINKING, the way we look at things. This has saved me on many occasions from sinking into a dark place. Take music for example and your perception of how well you are doing with your craft. Some folks get upset over not being seen enough, not getting enough views on you tube, or even facebook. I admit early on these things used to trouble me and I would take it personally. I totally don't now. If no one whatsover made a comment or said they liked what I did it wouldn't change how I view myself. Dont get me wrong I love the comments I get and I get some great comments, but when I dont, it doesnt get me thinking I'm past it or maybe I'm not worth anything, It would be no indication to me as to how well I was doing. I've mentioned before that I saw a 5 year old on you tube who's father was trying to get to sing.....she didn't...not a word. That video got 500,000 views. This is how fickle the whole numbers game can be. Conversely you will see many talented people getting 35 views or less.
I spoke to a woman this week who told me "I didn't sleep at all last night"...I asked her "Are you worried about anything?"
She said "Yes, trouble in the family"...I said "Can you change anything?" She said "No its out of my hands"....So I said "Maybe you should keep yourself strong by being ready to support your family whatever the outcome is" If you cant change a situation, you have to change your thinking.
Modern life can screw you up if you let it. Whether its the media's perception of what "beautiful" is or its perception of what passes for talent or what doesn't. The celebrity world is NOT the real world, its tinsel, its glitter, its glam, and although there is nothing wrong with those things in the right setting, they dont represent whats real. Whats real is what YOU are doing. If you can see advancement in relation to yourself, that you are progressing, getting better at what you do then you are a success.
There's one thing that no one can be, and that's you. If you want to survive the negativity, sometimes the invisibility, or the urge to stop in your quest for betterment, it may well involve changing your thinking, to survive.
Anyone who knows me well knows how often I draw comparisons between Art and Music. To me they are parallel worlds with lots of similarities. I came across a great artist by the name of Alexandr Onishenko who is from the Czech republic.
Alexandr Onishenko is an artist based in Prague, Czech Republic. Well known for his vibrant impressionist paintings, his work is exhibited throughout Europe and the United States.
On one of his exhibition videos someone said that the great appeal of Onishenko was that he always left something for the viewer to imagine, so that they could make that particular painting their own.
What a cool idea that is! To actually create a work that not only connects with the person but also involves the person making it in a sense belong to them too!
That means not spelling things out exactly by being too specific but by leaving room for personal interpretation. One of my most popular songs is a song called Mr Angel. Mr Angel is about a specific person and also a specific event and whilst you can still close your eyes and imagine the song the very fact that the song tells the story you have to follow along.
The course I am currently enjoying conducted by Michelle Lockey who is a successful submitter to TV and Film Sync opportunities has been highlighting the need for universal lyrics, lyrics which are not specific but conveying feelings and emotions rather than facts such as places and names.
Here are some of my Lyrics to a song I wrote called Drownin' I think you will see how this conveys a mood and feelings that leave a lot of room for imagination.
As songwriters we need to keep learning and branching out in our development. Michelle's course is making me re think things but also helping to polarise what I need to do as an artist but also someone who writes for Film and TV. For me at least I dont have a problem writing in different modes. If I see a guy in the street with a story that needs telling I will do that with my artist- singer songwriter head on. If a producer is looking for a certain something? Then I will write a song with a certain something in mind. It really isnt a problem.
I hope you all have a great weekend and enjoy your growth and development as Singer songwriters if that's what you do, and if not, thanks for reading this article. Life is fascinating and I hope this article meant something to you.
I guess it sounds like a completely obvious phrase but its so easy to just slip into a pattern of sideways comfort zone steps. When we have goals it is important to see them as short term and long term. We might have a long term goal in our heads but it usually takes a lot of short term goals to achieve it.
The Internet is great for finding courses that suit us if we need to advance at something in order to achieve our long term goals. Check out what is on offer, see what you can afford (Some training is actually free!) Check out any reviews to see just how good thay are. Commit to it, see it through and then advance to your next step. Its all about being forward moving.
My main goal which is a constant and runs parallel with the short term and long term goals is to perfect my craft at being a singer-songwriter. That means being concerned about the quality of what I do as well as the quantity, in fact the quantity of my songwriting isnt an issue for me, so obviously the quality is what I am always aware of. I have both short term goals which involve studying and learning from courses with the aim to fulfilling my long term goal of writing for Film and TV and Ads. http://michellelockeycourses.teachable.com/courses/music-licensing . I am confident that I will do well at this and am therefore doing what it takes.
Female Mixing Engineers is a great blog where Females who are interested in mixing their own or others music can get some great advice and hot tips!
Darcy Jeavons the founder of F.M.E, has passionately wanted to do this for some time now and is looking forward to sharing any information which can aid in a great mix!
So, you love mixing music, and you have no Y chromosome. You are in the right place! Mixing, mastering, recording, producing, audio editing — these skills are not accomplished with anything below our belt line. We use our ears, our minds, and our hearts. The fact that most mixing engineers are males is just one of those things. Like the gender dynamics that existed in the medical field decades ago, when the term “doctor” produced an image of a middle-aged male with a smile and a stethoscope. But times keep on changing. Although we may still visualize a music producer or mixing engineer as a male in the framework of our mind, the access of affordable home recording and mixing technology is in the hands of everyone who wants to create music. Everyone. And I have a feeling that there are females out there who are rockin’ the Auralex off of their home studios. Ladies, this blog’s for you!
For many years Music has been a driving force for me when it came to songwriting, so much so that even very well known songs were lost on me as to what they were about.
I would hear people discussing things like what the meaning was of "Lucy in the sky with diamonds" a Beatles classic. I quite frankly didnt give a hoot what it meant, I loved the sound.
It must have been about five years ago now when I got in touch with my "words" side, which is odd to say the least because I wrote lots of poems very early on as a child and well into my teens.
Words have power, and if you combine that power with music that moves you, you then have a double enlightenment.
I recently saw a post on a chat box regarding one of my songs being played on the radio (Barefoot), and he specifically wrote out a particular line he liked when the song ended and I instantly knew what it was that affected him.
I have now made a point of reviewing my lyrics for even the most subtle of changes that might make a good song a great song, and I am amazed always at how often just one word can change the whole flavour of the song.
I sang a song for a dear friend recently and she misheard my lyrics. We laughed and then I realised that what she misheard was in fact a big change to the song. That was the line I had repeated back to me on the chat box. Instead of the original intention being "I want everything that we can ever be" It was changed to "I want everything that we can NEVER be" The whole song was now about a yearning for what you cant have as opposed to wanting everything you could have.
There's no real point in being over analytical, after all we are songwriters not scientists, but giving your lyrics a bit more attention at the end might well be worth the time.
Words have power....Music has power....together they can affect individuals lives and also the world.
Oh and when I said making a good song into a great song ? That doesnt mean neccessarily a song that becomes a world wide hit. There are many great songs that dont get heard enough because they aren't commercial enough. I have been moved to tears by songs with very few views on You Tube and at the same time yawned at yet another copy of a copy of a clone.
Well, no sooner we lose David Bowie, we then go and lose Glen Frey, two artists who I have admired for different reasons. David Bowie I admired for his huge creativity and ability to re invent himself and Glen I admired for being the founder member of what I would consider one of the best bands of all time. I was a sixtees child and The Beatles were the ones who made me want to be a Singer songwriter. The Eagles however was the band I used to dream of being in. They taught me many things as an artist, and at the outset I want you to know that I have never idolised anyone or felt that anyone was so "up there" that they were out of reach....no...we are all human beings with talents and Glen showed me things just by being Glen who was a big part of the skillfully woven fabric known as The Eagles.
I remember purchasing the "Hell Freezes over" DVD, and I have to admit I wore the thing out. I watched, admired, learned and fell in love with the fact that a group of guys could completely "Own" a stage without any gimmicks and sat on stools. They were just themselves
In a recent interview (2012) Glen was asked "If you had five minutes left in your life which song would you play"?................He said "One of these nights" and then continued to give the varied reasons...like chord progression, instruments involved, Don Henleys vocal.
Glen Frey was one of those examples who helped to make me sure that this is what I want to do with the rest of my life. Thank you Glen R.I.P. and thanks for the inspiration.

The initial stage of life is very important. Elevation or downfall of life is determined by the samskaras inculcated in the childhood. A person who is compassionate, generous, having endurance, is devoted to his/her duty, amiable, and amasses virtues since childhood or youth – only such a person can become a good human being in the future. A youth who becomes an addict in young age, and who is dominated by traits of anger, arrogance, covetousness for sense pleasures and who is unable to withstand the impulses of desire, anger and taste – such a person in the future ends up blemishing humanity in society. One should consider only such a youth fortunate who from the beginning of his or her life amasses divine virtues while living in the company of good people, saints and evolved souls and stays away from bad company.
Being cautious while executing one’s duties and actions and having a firm resolve to complete them in the perfect way – all these are auspicious signs of success. On the contrary, being lethargic in performing one’s duty from the very beginning, to start the work with a melancholic state of mind without any interest – these are ill omens on the path of success.
Everyone has the experience that the day one wakes up late in the morning due to laziness, daily routine activities like defecation, bathing etc., don’t get completed in time and that day all tasks get messed up and become disorganized. The day one gets up at the right time and there is no indolence in executing one’s routine, that day all tasks are concluded in an organized way. That day appears to be a pleasant one.
The one whose life has a proper beginning, in accordance with Dharma, ethics and propriety of conduct is bound to have a good, pure, happy and auspicious future. There is no doubt in it.
Those people who, from the beginning, give importance to the beautification of their physical bodies, and for that they lay emphasis on clothes and jewelry and for that to wealth, are unable to adorn their lives. Such people remain enslaved by the material objects and human beings. If from childhood or puberty one gives place to laziness, luxury, bad habits and desires of sense indulgence in his life he invariably leads an inauspicious and unpleasant life later on and meets the similar end.
One can predict the future of man, either bright or dark, from the activities of the initial stage of his life. A small vice, bad habit, the habit of stealing small things, a tendency to tell a lie or any other untoward evil doing of the initial stage of life will not remain small in the future. Just as a spark turns into a huge fire when it comes in contact of firewood, the small vice will assume a dangerous form.
This is a point to be understood that whatever appears small in the beginning, never remains the same in the future. Be it a small vice or an accompanying minor mistake or a small virtue or a sublime feeling or a thought either noble or evil.
The intelligent man ought to be alert in eradicating whatever is inauspicious, bad, impure, unnecessary and unwholesome when it is in a lesser form. How can one renounce ‘more’ when he is unable to give up ‘less’? Therefore it is easier to forsake ‘less’ for it will be very difficult to renounce when it will become ‘more’.
The person who knows what is acceptable on account of necessity and wholesomeness from the beginning of every task and rejects what is unwholesome or harmful leads a virtuous and nice life in due course of time.
Generally, the stages of childhood and puberty remain under the charge of one’s guardians i.e. parents, brother, teachers and elderly relatives. Still, some wise children and youth are endowed with a good intellect and on their own have a strong dislike for inauspicious, bad, impure things and naturally they are inclined to auspicious, aesthetic, pure things.
It is the responsibility of parents, the elder brother and teacher that they should not allow their children to have any contact with anything impure, immoral and bad right from the beginning. Interest towards learning and education, behaving courteously while dealing with elders, good conduct, Dharma and the importance of God should be inculcated in the minds and hearts of children from the very beginning.
To make ones beginning wonderful, to not allow it to get corrupted by bad company and bad traits, to spend one’s energy in auspicious actions only, to intensify the desire to know the essence of dharma and of God – these are observed only in fortunate people.
The farsighted and intelligent man knows whether any man is heading towards a bright or dark future simply by looking at the initial stage of his life.
To save the beginning of any type from laziness and negligence and taking care of it in a planned manner is what makes for a good future.
When you wake up in the morning, first up remember that Lord, by the power of Whom you are alive and are enjoying the nectar of fulfillment of all your desires.
Understand the scheme of beginning any task on this day, the limit of its accomplishment and the schedule of the whole day. If you can’t keep them in mind, then jot down all the tasks.
When you meet someone begin a talk with him plain heartedly, sincerely and seriously with a calm mind uttering pleasant words. Don’t behave artificially and insincerely. If you establish a bond of love with someone then from the first only express your desire, your nature or your flaws to that person. Prepare the person in advance that incase he or she loves you then how the person will have to carry on while compromising with your flaws, your mistakes, your shortcomings. Don’t dupe the person so that you can avoid betrayal.
Whatever task you start, in the beginning itself gather the means needed to complete it. In order to face the obstacles that may come in the way and in order to make oneself alert, one should keep in his possession whatever may be required. This way you will not fail in the accomplishment of the task. This is about the practical living. One needs to be even more careful in the spiritual life.
Great injustice is being done to the children of India. They are exposed to obscene literature and movies. Still, our children and youths are much better as compared to their counterparts in other countries. They are very hard working. They go to foreign countries and make some money bearing hardships. They are not pleasure-loving like the youth of other countries. This is because of the austerity of their parents who in turn are blessed by the great Indian culture and satsang of supremely ascetic Indian saints which is capable of eradicating all sorrow for all times. It does not eradicate sorrow by going to other world (heaven) or by removing or gaining something. It does not teach that you will get rid of sorrow by attaining something (pleasant) or by removing something (unpleasant). The (spiritual) knowledge of Indian culture makes you blissful in whatever circumstances you may be; your happiness does not depend upon your circumstances. It teaches you the art of remaining undisturbed in all situations. But unfortunately, influenced by the western culture, our countrymen do injustice to themselves and to their children.
A police officer came to my satsang in Delhi. I felt pity for his two children who accompanied him. I said, “They will not develop properly; their digestion is impaired.”
I said, “Why do you give them so much of chocolates? Don’t you know how harmful the chocolates and fast foods are? They upset the stomach.”
When people get money and power, they give to their children whatever they want. Children in turn, misguided by advertisements, ask for the things they see advertised on television. This is spoiling the children’s health and damaging the glory of India. Children are losing reverence for their parents. This is the result of convent education. If the parents do not avail of satsang in their lives, they too are deprived of the necessary wisdom. Happiness or Knowledge is not in enhancing ignorance, in sense-enjoyments or in struggle for power. The solution to all problems is found only in the Knowledge of non-duality. This Knowledge is taught only in Gurukulas.
In convent schools, children are taught to hate Hindu sadhus. Hindu gods and goddesses are ridiculed. They prove Hanumanji to be a monkey. They draw a picture of an animal with tail and ask the children, “What is this?” The children say, “It is an animal.”
Then they make a picture of Hanumanji and say, “Similarly this too is an animal.” Such derogatory traits are inculcated in children. When these children grow up and become high-rank officers, they harbour hatred towards Hindu saints, Hindu religion and Hindu scriptures even though they are Hindus themselves. They take to drinking. Drinking impairs their judgement. They fail in avoiding discord with own wife and parents. I know many such youths. A Sadhaka came and spoke to me crying bitterly, “My daughter did graduation; she got a job with a salary of Rs.30000 per month. Her husband also earned Rs.35000 per month. I spent 42 lakh Rs. on their wedding but my daughter is pregnant with four months of gestation and they are split-up. She lives with me.”
What is the cause? The education and training given to the youth today is ‘eat, drink and enjoy’. I have seen many such couples. There is a manager in a company with a handsome pay. His wife too is a manager with annual income of Rs.12-15 lakhs. Still they are miserable because of the attitude of pursuing sense-enjoyments that has been inculcated in them and the perverse training they have received, ‘We don’t care for others. We must enjoy our own life’. The pursuit of external pleasure deprives one of inner joy and stimulates animal instincts. The children, who have received good traits right from childhood, do not give much importance to external pleasures. They are happy and contented in whatever condition they are. Even those coming into contact with them learn something from them. It does not matter if we are not able to provide to our children wealth, big houses, cars or bank balance but we must instil in them good traits. If you have inculcated good traits in your children, you have given them great wealth; you have given them big assets. This wealth of good traits will make your darling children successful in every walk of life; so much so that this wealth will make them capable of attaining to God, the master of infinite opulence. It is the bounden duty of all of us to inculcate good traits in children. We should not be negligent in this.
The Public Service Association (PSA) says the economic fallout from the Fonterra milk contamination could be repeated in the meat industry if companies continue to have the power to inspect their own meat.
The New Zealand based company Fonterra, the world’s biggest milk exporter, is currently involved in a big scandal because milk products had to be recalled due to a bacteria contamination scare, which could possibly lead to botulismus.
Last year the government gave the go-ahead to a number of meat companies to carry out their own in-house meat inspections rather than using trained, specialist and independent government meat inspectors employed by AsureQuality.
PSA National Secretary Richard Wagstaff says it’s an experiment which opens up New Zealand’s meat export industry to a huge amount of risk.
“What is happening with Fonterra milk products shows just how costly a contamination problem can be to New Zealand’s export trade and to the economy as a whole. Contamination in one area of Fonterra’s production supply chain has cast a shadow over all other New Zealand dairy products and is putting the reputation of New Zealand’s entire dairy industry under threat. The same thing could happen in our billion dollar meat export industry if just one company is caught out not conducting proper inspections or if contaminated product got through,” he says.
At the moment in-house meat inspection is happening in about five plants but Auckland Farmers Freezing Company (AFFCO) has indicated it may soon move all its plants to company inspection.
Richard Wagstaff says “there’s an inherent conflict of interest in companies inspecting their own meat which will encourage short-cuts and see commercial interests overriding robust standards of food safety and quality control. The risks are huge and the PSA and meat inspectors have been repeatedly trying to raise concerns.”
In the interests of food safety, market confidence and economic strength, the PSA urges the government to reinstate a meat inspection regime across all meat companies which is regulated by independent government meat inspectors, according to Wagstaff.

When you trade the foreign exchange rate you will want to be successful. However, in order to be successful you need to know what successful traders do. When you know what the traders are doing you can follow them and also be successful. There are 4 parts to the approach of successful traders and you should know what all of them are.
The first thing that successful traders do is consider their approach to trading the foreign exchange rate. The first point they will look at is the timeframe that they are going to trade in. Some traders are better at trading short-term while others are better at trading long-term. You need to determine which timeframe best suits you.
One way of doing this is to look at the different trading strategies for the different timeframes. While there are a number of strategies for each timeframe you should find a strategy that you like. The strategy should be easy to understand and you need to be able to visualise yourself using it. Once you have found the strategy you can see which timeframe it falls into.
In the approach step you also need to think about the currency pair you are going to trade. This pair should relate to your strategy and should work well with the type of strategy you are using.
The second thing that successful traders do is set their attitude. This means that they look at their personality and emotions and place controls into their trading strategy and plan. It is important that you do this because emotions can lead to losses on the market. You also need to ensure that you can be patient enough to trade.
The attitude of a successful trader incorporates a number of aspects. The first is patience which you need to wait for the right market conditions. The second is discipline which you need to avoid emotional trades. The third is objectivity which also helps with the controlling of emotions and avoidance of emotional trades. The last aspect is a realistic view of what you can expect from the market and trading.
The third thing that successful traders do is discriminate when they trade. With this step you have to determine which trading tools and currency pairs will work for you. If the tool or pair is not helping your trading then you should stop using it. You have to be objective when you discriminate in trading. If you like a technical tool, but it is not helping your trading then you have to stop using it. This is the only way that you can ensure successful trading.
The last thing that successful traders do is accurately manage their trading. When you manage your trading you have to look at risk management, money management and trade management. Risk management helps to limit the amount of risk you face and the losses that can come from this. Money management ensure that you always have money in your trading account. Trading management looks at how well your trades are doing and what can be done to make them better.
There are a number of acts that traders complete on the forex rates market that they should actually be avoiding. These acts are generally done with good intentions, but they rarely lead to anything good. You should consider what these acts are, what they can do to your forex rates trading and how you can avoid them. Once you know all of this you will be able to avoid these negative behavious and be more successful in your trading.
When you trade with forex news you have to use the right news releases. There are hundreds of news releases each day and most of them will not relate to the currency pair that you are trading. They will also not relate to the strategy that you are using. There are three levels of forex news based on the impact they have on the market. Certain trading strategies will need to use certain levels of impact. For longer strategies you need higher impact because of the long-term effects you are looking for.
The mistake that trades make is to act on forex news that is not right for their strategy. This could be a short-term trader acting on news that relates to long-term trading. When you do this you are not going to make the profits that you should and you could actually make a loss. To avoid this you need to know what news you have to look for to complete your trading.
Many traders assume that once they have experience on the forex market they are meant to diversify their trading. This could be through the trading of more currency pairs or through the use of different trading strategies. This is something that you do not actually have to do on the market. If you are making the profits that you need from the way that you are currently trading then you do not have to worry about diversification.
Diversifying your trading when you don’t need to will only lead to problems with your trading. If you increase the currency pairs you trade then you have to increase the amount of analysis that you need to do. This is something that will cause you to miss trading opportunities and you could fall into analysis overload. To avoid this you simply need to understand that not all traders need to diversify their trading.
An act that a lot of traders complete which is very bad is to trade without testing. This means that they have not used the demo account to test the method they are using to trade. When you are faced with this you will lose money on the market because you are not aware of the limitations and potential weaknesses of the strategy you are using.
To avoid this you simply need to use the demo account before you trade. If you make any changes to the way that you trade you should test the strategy on the demo account before you trade live.

RA'ANANA, Israel, and NEW YORK, Sept. 06, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UroGen Pharma Ltd. (NASDAQ:URGN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatments to address unmet needs in the field of urology, with a focus on uro-oncology, today announced the appointment of Paul Chu to the position of Vice President of Business Development, effective immediately. In this newly-created role, Mr. Chu will be responsible for leading and optimizing the Company’s strategic business development initiatives.
“We are pleased to welcome Paul to our senior leadership team. Paul brings with him more than 15 years of public company experience in corporate business development, finance, commercial operations and strategic planning,” said Ron Bentsur, Chief Executive Officer of UroGen. “Paul has a proven track record of executing comprehensive business development plans and achieving strategic goals as well as a deep understanding of the urology field. His expertise will be invaluable as we work to maximize the Company’s value by broadening the reach of our drug candidates and innovative RTGel™ formulation technology.”
Prior to joining UroGen Pharma, Mr. Chu served as Director, Corporate Business Development for Allergan plc, where he led business development initiatives for Allergan’s Medical Aesthetics and Neurotoxin franchises. In this position, Mr. Chu played a significant role in the successful completion of multiple M&A and licensing transactions, most notably Allergan’s acquisition of Zeltiq Aesthetics, Inc. for $2.5 billion and of privately held LifeCell Corporation, which served as Allergan’s primary entry point into regenerative medicine, for $2.9 billion. Mr. Chu previously held a similar role leading Allergan’s Urology franchise, where he completed the exclusive worldwide license for UroGen’s RTGel™ for use in combination with neurotoxins for the treatment of overactive bladder. Earlier in his career, Mr. Chu held roles of increasing responsibility in finance and commercial operations for Allergan and The Coca-Cola Company. Mr. Chu holds an MBA from the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business and a BA in Finance and Business Administration from California State University, Fullerton.
“I am excited to join UroGen at such a pivotal time in the Company’s growth,” stated Mr. Chu. “During my time at Allergan, where I led the completion of the exclusive worldwide license agreement for RTGel™ for use in combination with neurotoxins, I came to realize the potential of this technology and UroGen's uro-oncology pipeline. I look forward to applying my expertise and working with the Company’s senior leadership team to help UroGen achieve its business development objectives.”
UroGen Pharma (NASDAQ:URGN) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing advanced non-surgical treatments to address unmet needs in the field of urology, with a focus on uro-oncology. The Company has developed RTGel, a proprietary sustained release, hydrogel-based formulation for potentially improving therapeutic profiles of existing drugs. UroGen Pharma's sustained release technology is designed to enable longer exposure of the urinary tract tissue to medications, making local therapy a potentially more effective treatment option. UroGen Pharma's lead product candidates, MitoGel and VesiGel, are designed to potentially remove tumors by non-surgical means and to treat several forms of non-muscle invasive urothelial cancer, including low-grade UTUC and bladder cancer. UroGen Pharma has offices located in both Ra’anana, Israel and New York, NY, USA.
This press release contains forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including with respect to the clinical development of MitoGel™ and other product candidates in UroGen Pharma’s pipeline, the scope and development of the Company’s product candidate pipeline, the potential utility and applicability of the RTGel technology beyond uro-oncology and overactive bladder, and the ability to consummate business development transactions, which statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to: the timing and success of clinical trials and potential complications thereof; the ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval; the labeling for any approved product; the scope, progress and expansion of developing and commercializing a product candidate, the size and growth of the market(s) therefor and the rate and degree of market acceptance thereof vis-à-vis alternative therapies; the maintenance of any applicable collaborations; the ability to achieve business development transactions on favorable terms to the Company, if at all. In light of these risks and uncertainties, and other risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of the final prospectus for UroGen Pharma’s initial public offering of securities in the United States filed with the SEC on May 5, 2017 and other filings that UroGen Pharma makes with the SEC from time to time (which are available at http://www.sec.gov), the events and circumstances discussed in such forward-looking statements may not occur, and UroGen Pharma’s actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied thereby. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and are based on information available to UroGen Pharma as of the date of this release.

I was back at Bukit Timah this morning with a friend, and quite a few of the plants there were blooming! It was rather dark in the forest though, due to the cloud cover above. I had to use flash most of the time, and so the photos did not really turn out very well.
The bat lily (Tacca integrifolia) was one of the plants blooming. The maroon flower looked really stunning.
Saw lots of these little flowers (about 1cm wide) by the sides of the road leading up the hill, but couldn't really tell which tree they belong to since there are so many tall trees there.
And this was the second time I saw this tree near the carpark blooming, but I still had no idea what tree this is.
Apart from the plants, the fungi were blooming too! I saw a mixture of pink and grey mushrooms growing on a log above, looking just like little umbrellas.
And these white mushrooms looked like... no prizes for guessing what I was thinking... little white umbrellas! Haha...

Consisting of a series of in-depth scientific and state-of-the-art lectures in important areas of sports injury and illness prevention research. Typically, these will cover different aspects of injury or illness prevention (epidemiology, injury mechanisms, risk factors, pathophysiology, prevention methods) as they relate to a particular injury type (e.g. hamstring injuries, ACL injuries), health problem (e.g. asthma, sudden cardiac death, eating disorders) or sport (e.g. rugby, volleyball), but other approaches are also welcome.
Michael Makdissi (Australia): The public health impact of concussion in children. How do we measure risk and outcomes? (12 minutes)
Carolyn Emery (Canada): Primary Prevention: Strategies to reduce the risk of concussion in pediatric sport participants? (12 minutes)
Kevin Guskiewicz (USA): Secondary Prevention: Risk factors and prevention strategies to reduce the risk of re-injury in children. (12 minutes)
Kathryn Schneider (Canada): Tertiary Prevention: Are there options for rehabilitation following concussion in youth to reduce time to return to play? (12 minutes)
Every day, children all over the world put themselves at risk of concussion through sporting and recreational activities. Our present understanding of sport-related concussion comes largely from adult studies and anecdotal evidence. However, our children are not little adults. There is an emerging body of evidence specific to pediatric sport-related concussion. Currently, the best treatment for concussion in children appears to be prevention. Prevention needs to occur across the continuum of care in this population: 1. Primary prevention is aimed at stopping the occurrence of concussion, 2. Secondary prevention requires early diagnosis, before progression and/or re-injury, and 3. Tertiary prevention ensures full recovery and appropriate return to play. A better understanding of childhood sport-related concussion is imperative to make evidence-informed clinical decisions and establish best practice in the prevention of concussion in this population. In this 60 minute symposium internationally recognized researchers with significant expertise in youth sport concussion will share their research, expertise, and clinical perspectives on sport-related concussion in children across primary, secondary and tertiary prevention perspectives. Dr. Michael Makdissi (Australia) is a Sport and Exercise Medicine Physician with research and clinical expertise in pediatric and adolescent sport medicine. His experience on the interdisciplinary team informing the recent Zurich Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport and in developing the Child SCAT will inform his introduction to this session. He will summarize the public health impact of concussion in children and present evidence related to the measurement of concussion risk and outcomes in children. Dr. Carolyn Emery (Canada) will bring an epidemiological lens to summarize the evidence informing primary prevention strategies that reduce the risk of concussion in pediatric sport participants. Dr. Kevin Guskiewicz (USA) will bring years of research experience in sport-related concussion to inform best practice in secondary prevention where he will present evidence related to risk factors and prevention strategies to reduce the risk of re-injury in pediatric sport participants. Dr. Kathryn Schneider (Canada) will bring her perspectives as a physiotherapist specializing in rehabilitation post-concussion and epidemiologist and her experience on the team informing the recent Zurich Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport to this symposium. She will present the current evidence related to rehabilitation following concussion in youth sport in reducing time to return to play. This symposium will conclude with a discussion informing future directions for research informing best practice in the prevention of concussion in children participating in sport. The discussion will be informed by interdisciplinary perspectives from sport medicine, physiotherapy, athletic training, biomechanics and epidemiology.”

You can go to the mountains, the beach or to any major city and find a vacation home rental these days. Deciding if this relatively new way to spend your few weeks of time off each year is right for you depends on what your needs are. Many people swear by what is often called VRBO (Vacation Rental by Owner) and rely on this for all their vacations.
Guana Cay Vacation Home Rentals are usually set up by the week. You rent a home that is privately owned directly from the homeowner and have the right to stay in it and use all of the amenities for the duration of your stay. VRBO’s vary in size from nice-sized condominiums to spacious homes that can comfortably fit up to twenty people. Why are so many people turning to Guana Cay vacation home rentals?
• The price is right. Because you are renting an entire house, most people share the cost with another couple or family because there is plenty of room. The smallest VRBO is usually two bedrooms and two full baths as well as a kitchen, living room and patio, so when you look at prices, remember to divide them by how many people will actually be paying.
• You have more space. Staying in a hotel for a week or two can get very confining. After a few days having to sit on your bed to watch television can get old. Add in not being able to relax or eat somewhere other than where you sleep and a house is a much better option. You can spread out yourself and your stuff in a vacation home rental.
• You have more privacy. There’s no worrying about the loud couple next door, late night revelers in the hallways or other disturbances when you’re staying in a Guana Cay vacation home rental. You can come and go when you please, lounge on your balcony or porch without prying eyes and generally feel safer and more secure knowing you’re in a private home.
• You save money in other ways. With a complete kitchen, you have the chance to make your own meals. Over a week or two in an expensive area, a Guana Cay vacation home rental can save you hundreds of dollars just on food bills – and you can eat whatever you want, whenever you want!
• The amenities are better. Don’t you hate dragging home two weeks worth of dirty laundry at the end of your vacation? And having wet bathing suits hanging in the bathroom? Not a problem in a VRBO – just use the washer and dryer whenever you want to. The beds are also more comfortable and the décor is warm, welcoming and homier.
• Guana Cay Vacation home rentals are great for family reunions. How many times have you tried to get everyone together in one place? It’s hard to decide where and when, but planning a family vacation together in a beautiful vacation spot is always a great way to have a family reunion. Many people end up using a vacation home rental for a group vacation year after year.
The key to finding a good Guana Cay vacation home rental? Look for listings that state they are “vacation rental by owner.” (Not a rental company.) Owners save the commissions and pass the savings on to you. Also look for VRBO’s that list references or testimonials from previous visitors. Then just find the size and location that’s right for you. If you choose a Guana Cay vacation home rental for your next vacation, you’ll find yourself going back again and again.
GASB Statement 51, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Intangible Assets, is effective beginning July 1, 2009 for audits FY 2010. For districts reporting on the accrual basis of accounting, the cumulative effect, if any, of applying this Statement requires a restatement of beginning net assets, fund balances, or fund net assets (as appropriate). This means that certain intangible assets (and related amortization) in existence from July 1, 1980 to June 30, 2009 may need to be reported as the beginning (July 1) balance for intangible assets for FY 2010. See the reference to “Retroactive Reporting” contained in the policy for further details. The ISFIS supplemental policy and negotiations services Policy Booster includes a sample GASB 51 Accounting and Financial Reporting for Intangible Assets policy. See the sample.
John presents us with a familiar encounter where Jesus is surrounded by his closest companions. In an act of seemingly extreme wastefulness, Mary anoints Jesus’ feet with pure nard. I find the contrast between Mary and Judas fascinating. On the one hand we have Mary, who is completely comfortable in Jesus’ presence (indicated by the fact that she lets her hair down) making a huge sacrifice in anointing his feet. Judas, on the other hand, seems guarded and false and the passage suggests that his motives were other than he had indicated. He pretends to be concerned for the poor when, in fact, he is only thinking about his own gain.
In reading this passage I thought about how we as a community interact with each other. While we all, no doubt, aspire to be like Mary in our openness and our honoring of Christ through our sacrifice, how often do we act like Judas? I am not suggesting that we might be stealing, rather that we hide our true thoughts and our true intentions from each other. Often, we strive to present an image of virtue, success and perfection, when in reality our lives are anything but. If our lives were indeed perfect what need would we have of Christ’s grace? Every one of us has our imperfections, our anxieties, our pressures, our struggles, our temptations, our vulnerabilities and what good is being part of a Christian community if we do not share these with others? In Galatians 6:2, Paul instructs us to bear one another’s burdens. We should begin by acknowledging our frailties, setting aside our pride, dropping our defenses and being vulnerable like Mary.
Prayer: Dear Heavenly Father, who is without equal, you know me better than I know myself. You know my innermost thoughts and fears. Please let my pride never get in the way of honoring you. I humbly ask that you not let my troubles and my imperfections control me, but that you let me draw nearer to you every day in likeness of character, setting aside all that entangles and distracts. I ask this in the name of your Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.

The recent Danny Kaye conversation has me pondering an issue that's come up time and again in my mind. Do we love our favorite comedians more for being nice guys offscreen? Or better put, will we laugh less for finding out they're not? I admit it colors my perception, having spent far more hours reading about the lives of clowns than watching their movies. It's not that I expect them to be off-set Father Christmas' buying ice cream cones for every fan they meet. Buster Keaton, for instance, was never like that and I wouldn't have wanted him to be. It's just disillusioning to know that a happy face on screen is a sour one away from it (like Danny Kaye's, by most accounts). We set a higher standard for comedians' behavior in private life. They're a little like B western stars in that respect. I've read Hoppy had his bad days, and Rocky Lane could be downright truculent. But since cowboys and clowns appeal to the youth in all of us, it's vital they respond kindly when we meet, even if it's vicariously through fans of long ago. It pleases me that Oliver Hardy took time to sit a child on his knee and Stooges Moe and Larry invited fans to visit. I've belatedly gravitated to those latter boys partly for learning they were warm and friendly in retirement. There are sites devoted to correspondence between Moe Howard and admirers, including photos where they met. Larry liked receiving guests at the Motion Picture Country Home in spite of diminished health and seems always to have had time for autographs. The roll of honor among comedians is indeed one I'm constantly updating, and yes, it matters how they would have treated me had we crossed paths.
First off, there's the difference between "on" friendly and normal friendly. The "on" setting was one a Red Skelton maintained. He was said to do twenty minutes just for encountering fans at a hardware store. Would that have been fun or just alarming? Red also made hash of his writers. So did Jackie Gleason. One scribe remembered Bob Hope tossing paychecks from the top of a spiral staircase just to watch minions scramble for them. Not much to admire in that. But we're talking less about how they abused employees than how they'd treat us. I sometimes imagine myself going back and meeting clown idols, so to that extent they're still an ongoing presence. Would Lou Costello wave me off at a time travel'ed Jersey premiere of 1952's Jack and the Beanstalk? Like everyone who's read about them, I have conflicting emotions about Bud and Lou. Especially Lou. He was probably nicest to little kids. Costello's This Is Your Life reveals a lot. It's probably his most humanizing moment before a camera. The same program did as much for Laurel and Hardy, although their kind offices were never in doubt. Yes, Babe was more aloof, but we attribute that to a private nature. Stan was perhaps champion swell guy of the lot, the sort who answered every fan letter and maintained an open door policy at his Oceana Apartment of final residence. I've known admirers who dropped in there and/or spoke to Laurel on the phone. On each reported occasion, he was graciousness personified. Is it any wonder this is the comedian I'd most like to have known?
They say Buster Keaton was easily distracted, especially by a television he liked to play loud (to compensate for hearing loss). Keaton would sign or answer questions, but seemed bound to ponderings of his own. Small talk didn't interest him. Adept hands at Bridge claimed most of Buster's spare hours during later years. Otherwise, he'd be near as silent as his screen alter ego. What then, of those whose private persona contrasted most sharply with images we enjoyed on the screen? There's Jerry Lewis for extreme example here. How many youngsters came away heartbroken from disillusioning introduction to him? I've met several among wounded on Jerry's battlefields. He's one I'd be loathe to meet, or maybe afraid is the better word. Being not so ardent a fan helps in this instance. Groucho Marx is another I don't regret having missed. Some fans say it was an honor being insulted and dismissed by him. I confess to finding this a dubious one, but who's to say what distinction memory would accord to having once been rudely brushed off by Groucho? His brothers are a mixed group as potential acquaintance. Harpo was a recognized sweetheart (or pussycat, as Jerry might call him), while Chico remains a largely unknowable presence beyond gambling toward crisis at a thousand card tables.
They say Jack Benny was wonderful. A soul of generosity to fans, cast, crew ... everybody. Don't any of you correct me here with stories of Jack behaving unkind, for I'd want him to stay pristine. He's like Stan Laurel for being an icon minus even toes of clay. Some comedians were so rich as to be forever removed from the hoi polloi of fan intercourse. How many autograph hounds got to Charlie Chaplin after wealth and worldwide success swallowed him up? I once considered writing CC at that Swiss chateau, but figured one of a hundred servants would intercept my mail. Maybe Charlie sat around waiting for letters that never came, wondering if we'd forgotten him. Harold Lloyd had his palace closer to home. He strikes me as a hail-fellow-well-whatever with a glad hand for admirers, especially ones wearing Shriner hats. College students found Lloyd delightful when he brought silent backlog to campus auditoriums. Private life Harold seems to me to have fulfilled all the ambitions of his screen character. My own college years didn't miss HL's campus visits by very many, even if his did take place states away from where I attended. To go back (much) further, what would meeting Roscoe Arbuckle have been like? That seems to me like an encounter with Lincoln or Mark Twain. Still, I think Roscoe would have been good company. Navigating his vanished era might be something else. I'd be busier noticing stiff collars, straw boaters, and elegant modes of transport (his Pierce-Arrow!), taken aback no doubt by how people lived so rustic then. There'd be stopover to visit Mabel Normand, who'd be receptive enough based on what books say, but would I spend greater energy trying to warn she and Roscoe against calamities to come? What puts most of these personalities within realms of fanaticized access (excepting Mabel and Roscoe of course) is the fact of their lifetimes overlapping my own. Face-to-face encounters were at least conceivable, even if none came to fruition. The fact is I never met or exchanged mail with any of them. Perhaps some of you did. If so, I'd like hearing about it. No such thing as too many anecdotes about comedians we all enjoy.
I sent Groucho a birthday card for his 83rd (which, thanks to years of misinformation, I'd thought was his 78th). In return I received an autographed photo. The salutation ("To Mike, With my best wishes. Sincerely,") had clearly been written by someone else, but I was convinced the "Groucho" was legit.
Years later, I discovered my hunch was correct, the "someone else" being college student Steve Stoliar, courtesy of the latter's essential read, "Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House." Talk about living the dream... imagine WORKING for one of your idols in his own home! (The book also has an anecdote of the author, as a young boy, on a flight with both Skelton and Andy Griffith. "Sheriff Andy" turned out to be less agreeabe than ol' Red.)
Great subject and, as usual, perceptive observations. It's true! Many of us take to heart the nasty stuff about our film clowns in a much more personal way than ordinary gossip about garden variety movie stars. How many of us old time movie geeks are so objective as to remain unfazed when folks trot out some story about an over-sized ego attached to a beloved funnyman (or woman)? Every time the subject of old time comedians crops up in front of my father-in-law, he will coolly remind me of an unpleasant encounter with one of my faves, Eddie Cantor, "a demanding little man." Yet Cantor is a great example of the sort of comic who, for at least a period of time, say, the depression years, seemed to have a transcendent connection with his audience (was there ever an entertainer more in touch with what a dollar meant to the average Joe?) I think a lot has to with the democratic, small d, attitude we expect from clowns; we want these guys to be truth tellers, and as such, we are looking for them to show the same face to everyone. And, hopefully, a humble and compassionate one at that. Its thrilling to know Stan Laurel revealed the same courtesy to the pipe fitter writing fan letters in Virginia as to Jerry Lewis or Dick Van Dyke stopping by his apartment. He may have been the gold standard as to such conduct among aging comics, but its nice to think many of the great ones could muster up similar class on their good days.
Maybe the secret is to have a public persona that's not impossible to live up to. Kaye, Costello and Lewis were consistently cast as lovable innocents, but all three sweated to achieve that whimsy.
Stan played an innocent, and like them he was a very shrewd and hardworking comedian offscreen. I think the secret there was that he really loved comedy, and he seemed to attract fellow comedy-lovers who recognized and valued him as the creator rather than as the character. They didn't expect him to wear the derby and mangle sayings. In fact, they loved it when he revealed the mechanics of laughter. Jerry Lewis -- himself one of the fans who sought out Stan -- seems to have craved a similar offscreen rep. Hence the constant reminders that he was the genius behind the idiot as opposed to the idiot.
Jack Benny's comedy persona was actually a little negative -- vain, cheap, and (by design) constantly upstaged by funnier stuff around him -- so he didn't have a lot to live up to. It may have been surprising that he was a nice guy who enjoyed everything and laughed at anything. I remember someone describing how Benny went on about how good the water was at a restaurant, and realizing he wasn't trying to be funny. Benny laughed when the silliness was pointed out. Then he added, seriously, that it really WAS good water.
Guys like Moe Howard and Don Rickles instantly surprise fans by not hitting them. When they turn out to be gracious, it's a bonus.
A last note on Skelton: On the commentary for Magnificent Men in the Flying Machines, the director notes that Skelton kept a continuous monologue going when they were filming his prologue bits (even when trussed up with wires and such). The director and crew seemed to enjoy him breaking up the monotony -- there was evidently a lot of tech time involved. One wonders how long they'd last if Skelton were there for the entire shoot.
Red Skelton...in a gift shop in the middle of nowhere, Hawaii. I was 9. I asked for his autograph and he chose to act as if he did not hear me. Fair enough. But he went down a notch in my fan book.
Four years later, met Bob hope in a different store. He posed for a photo for me, then the flash didn't go off, and I ran off, bought a new flash bulb, came back, and he posed all over again. Plus he gave me an autograph.
Groucho Marx was gracious enough to reply to a letter I wrote him when I was 14. I treasure that note.
I had a friend who visited Moe Howard and Larry Fine in their latter years; he couldn't say enough nice things about them. Larry, in particular, was very welcoming and funny.
And there are others... I once talked to an old-timer who drove a cab in New York in the mid-1930s. One of his fares -- at the time, still strictly a stage actor -- was Bob Hope. Not only was Hope insulting and condescending, he was a lousy tipper, too. "I've never liked him since," he added. Beware the little guy with a long memory!
I read Greenbriar weekly, and you're doing a great job. In your latest column, you asked for anecdotes about comedians we may have met. I wanted to share my memory of Sir David Niven (not really a comedian, but he certainly had enough comic roles.) While in the military during the seventies I was traveling under military orders and was on an overbooked flight. The airline sent me out later, in first class. While coach was shoulder to shoulder, first class was relatively sparse. There was an old man sitting in the aisle across from me. It wasn't until he smiled at me and remarked that he didn't see many corporals in first class that I realized who he was. He asked me many questions about life in the American Army, and I responded honestly. He was genuinely interested and I have never forgotten the experience. I've learned since then that he had many military experiences he could have shared, but his focus was on my life in the Army, as well as the airline food.
I was also more than acquainted with August Swenson, who appeared as a munshkin in The Wizard of Oz as well as a cowboy in The Terror Of Tiny Town. August passed away last year after residing in Pflugerville, Texas (near Austin) for many years. He was a likable and personable man, always willing to tell stories about the movies he appeared in. He loved Judy Garland and put down many of the stories told about the little people's behavior on the set.
In 1978, when I met Andy Griffith, it was more like trying to talk with "Lonesome" Rhodes than with Andy Griffith. If "Tennessee" Ernie Ford hadn't all but forced him to sign an autograph for me, I wouldn't have received it.
When I was sixteen I was daunted by the presence of the potentially raucous Zero Mostel, but when I asked for his autograph he couldn't have been sweeter.
1. My dad used to talk about two Marine Corps buddies of his on leave in Los Angeles during WWII. A mutual friend took them to a party at Jack Benny's house. Jack couldn't have been nicer, but his wife Mary Livingstone was another matter -- who are these guys? who brought them? get them out but don't make a scene. This at a time when men in uniform were welcome almost anywhere. My dad's buddies left discreetly, and I suspect the mutual friend was never invited back.
2. Comic Jackie Vernon once told the story of writing every week to his childhood idol, Charlie Chaplin, a practice that went on, he said, for years without his ever getting an answer. Then in the 1960s, in London, Vernon saw Chaplin at a restaurant in London, where the old boy was filming The Countess from Hong Kong. Vernon approached him tentatively: "Mr. Chaplin, I've always been a fan of yours, my name is Jackie Vernon." Chaplin looked suddenly thoughtful. "Vernon...Vernon...Tell me, why did you stop writing?"
Bolo, I too have heard about how moody Andy can be. I knew a girl in college whose parents grew up in his home town, and she had some stories to tell...
Kevin K, I'm really glad to hear from someone who had a positive fan exchange with Groucho, and Tom, that's a neat remembrance of meeting Bob Hope.
Michael, I'm glad you mentioned "Raised Eyebrows: My Years Inside Groucho's House," one of my favorite inside-Hollywood books.
These stories about comedians such as Bob Hope just confirm that these guys were human and a fan's good or bad lifetime memory of meeting one of them could depend simply upon how his day was going or what mood he was in at the time of the meeting.
I never got to meet any of the people you covered this time, but did receive a nice signed photo from Moe Howard after writing to him in 1973. And I have heard numerous accounts from friends and family of how highly he regarded his (and The Stooges') fans.
By the way, that Three Stooges still you have there is a posed shot on the set of their 1944 Columbia short CRASH GOES THE HASH. (Hey, somebody might have been wondering!)
Craig Reardon sent some terrific anecdotes about our comedian friends which I am breaking down into individual comments. These are fantastic and I thank Craig very much for sharing them:
I can tell you that my uncle Bob was a commercial pilot for PSA (which stood for Pacific Southwest Airlines, I believe), which was once the short-hop carrier of choice on the West coast. And, he told me that Jerry Lewis was the worst....THE worst....passenger experience he could remember. I'd heard Lewis could be overbearing and rude, but here was a testimonial from my own uncle. I know that Lewis turned on a biographer so badly that the poor bastard was obviously still in shock as he finished up the book. I have a copy of it someplace. He (or the publisher) used a telling photo of Lewis on the jacket with one side of his face made up in a traditional clown makeup, staring straight at the spectator with a very serious expression; it had originally been taken for an issue of 'Parade' magazine, a supplement included in many Sunday papers across the country. You listen to Lewis's bumptious comments on the alternate audio track of those DVD reissues that appeared a few years back of his 'classics' made at Paramount in the late '50s and early '60s, and it's a mixed bag. Certainly he'd lost none of his own high self-regard, and amusingly, his pal Steve Lawrence, the gifted singer, is right in there seconding every motion Lewis makes for his own immortality. The important thing to mention in his defense, apart from what I myself believe is his very real talent as an actor and a filmmaker, is how often he praises some of his past colleagues to the skies, not only the actors, but his cinematographer, etc. He worked with Walter Scharf on more than one film, a fine and underrated Hollywood musician and composer. He worked with one of the most extrovert, wackjob makeup artists I've EVER met, Jack Stone. There is also that biography he wrote a couple years ago, a memoir about Dean Martin, that should be in every library of people who love 'show biz'. It's fascinating, frank, unsparing of himself, and ultimately a love letter to Dino, someone who, like a guy's first love, he never got over. I think Lewis, like other Jewish characters (Groucho, Danny Kaye, as you say...) is such a mixed bag that he's baffling.
As for Stan Laurel, I will never forget receiving a hand-out copy of the one-sheet "school newspaper" that was published by my junior high school in Inglewood, and seeing an article by one of the student journalists about meeting Stan Laurel! I was...awestruck. I was amazed and impressed that this guy had somehow figured out where (Santa Monica, apparently!) and how to track down Laurel---THE Laurel of Laurel and Hardy fame. I can still remember something the brief article quoted Stan as saying: "Have you every tried throwing a few eggs into an electric fan? Try it sometime! It's SMASHING!" I also seem to recall the boy had taken Laurel's picture, which was (badly) reproduced with the article by the imperfect school printing press. Much later in my own life I had the great good fortune to meet and work with Dick Van Dyke, a comedian---and fine actor--- you can definitely add to your list in the 'Super Good Guy' category, if my word is good for it. Dick told me he used to go to Stan's apartment as often as he could. He became very good friends with him, and it was a mutual admiration society, even though Van Dyke worshipped Laurel....and, famously, could do a pretty damned good imitation of him, when he was young!
I saw on some grim website that chronicles 'final resting places' the grave of Oliver Hardy, which is...or was....poignantly simple: a small plate on the ground, in a very simple-looking neighborhood cemetery somewhere in North Hollywood. I've heard that it's since been marked by a more impressive plaque bought and paid for by "Sons of the Desert", the Laurel and Hardy appreciation society. Stan fared better. I believe he's interred in the beautiful Forest Lawn property there by Griffith Park and---across the L.A. river---Warner Bros. Studios. His grave has a more handsome marker, something running along a short marble wall as I recall.
Before I go, I remember...ironically enough!...a great story Dick Van Dyke told me about Danny Kaye! He guested on Kaye's '60s variety hour on CBS. He said he was given a part in a skit where he played (let's say) a prosecutor in a courtroom, and Kaye was the defendant. Apparently his part or his performance garnered way more laughs from the assembled cast and crew during the rehearsal than Kaye did. So...by the time they went to tape it, Van Dyke was surprised to be informed that a little change had been made: he was now to play the defendant, and KAYE would perform the prosecutor! Van Dyke told this with a bemused chuckle, no rancor...but it was a telling anecdote!
I also would like to wedge in the observation that your portrait of smiling Harold Lloyd includes the terrific rubber glove on his right hand that I'm told Paramount's Wally Westmore arranged to have made for him, to disguise his missing digits from that famous movie bomb that accidentally went off in that same hand. I've worked in Lloyd's mansion, which has been rented out to film companies as a set, and even worn by time, this is an incredible house and property. Jaw-dropping. I remember staring intently at the most exquisite inlaid-wood designs in the entry area, a level of quality you could most likely not buy for any price today. You could write an entire piece just about Lloyd's amazing house! Not to mention his hobby of taking 3-D photos, several of which were cleverly published in a book by his daughter some years back, so that they can be viewed in 3-D using a special technique.
My personal feeling toward comedians both neurotic, insecure, defensive, nasty, or generous and humane is that it is their art that we must be grateful for. All these men you cited qualify, in my opinion, to earn our lasting respect for the laughs they generated and the humanity, in all its complexity, that instilled their characterizations.
I had the privilege of briefly exchanging letters with the talented and versatile musician Ken Darby, who had created vocal arrangements for movies going back to the 1930s, and in the later 1940s formed a friendship and alliance with Alfred Newman at 20th Century Fox that continued to the end of Newman's life, even after Newman left Fox to freelance after 1959. Darby remained devoted to his brilliant friend and colleague Al Newman, and he arranged to have a special library named after and in memory of Alfred set up at USC. However, the school required a certain sum of money be contributed to help underwrite it, and so Ken established a fund. An item was run in the LA Times about it, and I responded to it, being a huge fan of both Darby and Newman, which is how I got acquainted with the former. As far as Jack Benny is concerned, he was one of the earliest contributors to the fund, having supplied quite a large sum, according to Ken. Ken told me that contrary to Benny's contrived persona as the cheapest guy in Hollywood, he was actually quite generous, and as proof, Ken told me he'd said to him that if the fund finally looked as if it might still come up short of the figure USC required, he----Benny----would personally make up the difference. So, there you go. My pal Dick Smith, the genius makeup artist, began "The Sunshine Boys" when the cast consisted of Walter Matthau, who Dick had been hired to age appropriately, and Jack Benny. Benny was there for the first makeup test, if I'm not mistaken. However, as we all know, he died before the production started. His lifelong friend George Burns was approached to step into the part, and he was happy to do so. This, as you know, is the film which restarted Burns' film career, and new audiences discovered a man capable of making them laugh just as long and hard as any of the newer comics.
When I worked at Universal for several months in 1977, I remember that there was a stage (and it's still there) very near the front of the studio as it sits on Lankershim Blvd., which had been used to tape his television shows in the 1960s; and the well-known painting of him (I never knew who did it, but it was great...not a caricature, but a relaxed 'impression' of him in broad strokes) which was repeatedly reproduced in TV ads and print ads to publicize the show, was reproduced in a circle---painted----above the door to the stage, in his memory. It saddens me when on rare occasion I work there today, to see that it is no longer there----not the stage, but the painting.
PS I HAVE heard that as much as people loved Jack Benny, they disliked or even hated Mary Livingstone, his wife! Have you heard that? I don't want to speak so emphatically ill of the dead, especially if it isn't true!
The late Kay Linaker (Kate Phillips), told me that she loved working with Benny (Buck Benny Rides Again, Man About Town), but she didn't like Mary. Kate said that Mary was always belittling him.
My favorite Jack Benny story concerns one of his writers. Jack was meeting with his sponsor (contract renewal time); afterwards the writer asked Jack if he got a good deal. Jack replied, "I don't know if I got a good deal or not; I just know we'll be working together for another seven years." The writer later commented this was the kind of guarantee "you could walk into a bank and get a mortgage on."
You know, I'm beginning to think Mary Livingstone was not a nice person. Haven't I read that Jack maintained a pretty open marriage for himself? I seem to remember Ann Sheridan's name being mentioned ...
My favorite Jack Benny story was told by one of his writers, George Balzer. During a read through with Balzer and three other writers, Jack came to a joke he didn't like and said, "Fellas, on page six, I want a new joke."
With that, Benny fell out of his chair screaming with laughter. When he finally recovered, he got up and said, "I wouldn't change that joke now for a million dollars!"
Having grown-up during the time and place I did, being surrounded by nothing but show people in my formative years and going to school with so many who were the offspring of people in the biz, most of these names you've brought-up resonate.
I've already related previously my first-hand experience with Stan Laurel, who was exactly as you described, "The soul of graciousness". Indeed. I only regret I was too young at the time to really "talk shop" with the man, as others, like Van Dyke, did.
I've related my fathers' first-hand experience with W.C. Fields, who apparently was actaully (surprisingly?) extremely gracious -- if you treated him with respect.
Groucho I'd see all the time walking around Beverly Hills. Yeah. My mother told me a story where Groucho did his famous "walk" around her when family-friend Harry Ruby intoduced them one night at a Bev Hills spot called "Linny's". Mom said she didn't like him at all. (She adored Stan Laurel, however).
My mother was invited to join Mae Wests' party one night at a Directors' Guild dinner at The Hilton. "I have a little boy at home whose ten-years old and crazy about you" she told her. "That's nothin' honey, he's just got good taste!" she answered.
Moe invited me,as a child, to join his table one night at a restaurant called "La Scala" -- could not have been nicer.
I already mentioned a school-friend who met Lou Costello one afternoon poolside at The Riviera Hotel in Vegas, and used my friend as his "Bud Abbott straightman". Someone else I knew much later on, had been one of the little kids in their last film, "Dance With Me Henry". Said Lou was a darling, sweet man -- Abbott seemed "phony". His words,I wasn't present at the time.
Jerry Lewis I had a childhood encounter with at a hotel where we were both staying in San Diego. Not mean at all, but "on" doing schick" which coming from an adult I found a little grotesque.
Harold Lloyd I used to see coming from his house when we were living up the hill from him on Benedict Canyon. Seemed nice.
I have known several people who worked with Danny Kaye (including a close friend who was one of the dancers on his CBS series). "I didn't mind the way the way he treated us" (The backup dancers), he once told me, "But the way he treated Harvey Korman (his second-banana, this was before Carol) was really embarrassing!" He had also been a backup dancer on Jerry Lewis' short-lived variety show. The stories he told were predictable. Monster. Frankenstein incarnate.
Most clowns and comedians you must realize are unhappy, and often angry people to begin with. Many who struggled in vaudeville were left embittered and suspicious, even after success came.
Never saw Jack, damn it! One day, I'm getting into the car outside some medical buildings in Beverly Hills. As I got in the car my mother says, "Well, you just missed Jack Benny!" "Damn", I said, "How'd he look?" "He walked out of this medical building smiling and strode-up the street eating a Hershey bar."
I wish I could've met Jack Benny. The closest I got was when I saw him getting into a limo following George Burns' one-man show at Lincoln Center in NYC in the early '70s. (I saw the show with my mother, by the way. As good as George was, I was thrilled when Jack introduced him.)
Stories about Jack Benny's alleged open-marriage (and, yes, involving Ann Sheridan) have circulated for years. I once read about how he and Marilyn Monroe visited a nude beach together. That makes for quite a picture...
Great, great stories. I'll just toss in, I suspect if my time machine ever allows me to encounter W.C. Fields, he may well beat me over the head with his cane ("Begone, you tarfuffel of the future!") but I would not trade that experience for a kiss on the lips from Paulette Goddard.
Next, I'll just toss out that my mother worked at the Sheridan Hotel in downtown Akron, OH, when I was a kid, and that's where the celebrities stayed when in town for the All-American Soap Box Derby. She'd come home with a wealth of stories, and until her dying day she hated Mel Torme for mistreating people but loved Dick Clark and Michael Landon for being so nice. She loved Rosemary Clooney, and knew about ol' Rock Hudson's taste in partners way before most of the general public did. *L*
I did have the honor meeting Rosemary Clooney, once. A great gracious lady. Most of the great ones really are, you know. They know who they are and what they're about and why they got into the business in the first place, so they're quite secure and have nothing to "prove" to anyone.
Sorry to hear about her experience with Torme. I'd heard he could be difficult. The one time I met Mel he could not have been more gracious, we talked about my grandfather. (Mel had recorded "Who Cares What People Say?", a song M.K. had written for Ann Sheridan in "Nora Prentiss", and he had nothing but nice things to say about him.)
Hudson, I too remember hearing about at the dinner table, as a child, at the time he "married" his secretary. I think Dad was at Universal at that time. Everyone laughed about it, but not at all in a "put-down" or "superior way" at all. It was apparently just an "open secret" in Hollywood, everyone knew about many of these people, and yes, I well-remember hearing much gossip as a wide-eyed child, but it was not considered as "scandalous" as people now think. You were just expected to be discreet and keep your mouth shut, that's all.
A very close friend of my Dads' -- a director named Henry Kesler -- had worked as Andy Stones' A.D. on Fields' last film, "Sensations of 1945 -- and told me that one afternoon he drove Fields home after the days' shooting. Bill invited him up for a drink, and according to Hank, he was the soul of graciousness. (Probably alot of fun, too!)
Like you I contemplated asking Charlie Chaplin for his autograph while he lived in Vevey. So I ended up sending him a photo I wanted him to sign and he did. Signed it "Hello! Charlie Chaplin"
Through my old time radio fandom involvement, I have met a number of folks who worked with Jack Benny and every one of them speaks highly of him but less so of Mary.
Jack and Mary reportedly had separate bedrooms for years. I spoke recently with an author doing an upcoming book on Ann Sheridan about Benny's supposed involvement with her. I was told all of the rumors about Benny and Sheridan would be addressed in the book.
The only one of these folks I ever met, btw, was Bob Hope who, by that time, was largely deaf and had noticeable hearing aids so I chalked his aloofness up to that and was content with my autographed copy of his then-new book.
I can honestly say that Bob Hope was one of the most gracious performers I've met in my lifetime. He performed in Salisbury in 1989 for a hospital fundraiser. I was fortunate enough to be selected to introduce him, and as a result, got to spend about twenty minutes in the green room with him before the show. He possessed a sincere curiosity about the area, and chatted at length with my wife about her various pets, sharing information about his as well.
On the other hand, an encounter with Andy Griffith in 1978 left no doubt in my mind that Griffith and Andy Taylor are two completely different people. Distant and removed (I chalked it up to fatigue at the time), he charmed the crowd during a live show, but failed to impress anyone who met him at an earlier press conference. (I still have a tape of that conference.)
I too wrote to Groucho (I sent a card on the occasion of what would be his last birthday), and I received an autographed photo in return, well inside of a week.
It remains my most cherished possession. I think there's an undeniable warmth between Groucho's sarcastic exterior, and I would have given anything to meet him, even if it meant coming in for some razzing.
At a Jimmy Stewart charity event I was 3 feet away from Mr. Stewart He smiled at me, he was walking with Robert Wagner who gave the meanest looks to anyone who glanced in his direction.
Sorry to hear that about Robert Wagner. Have you read the books he did about old Hollywood, with Scott Eyman? They are really terrific.
no but I will look for that book. The funniest thing was Wagner did a promo for the charity event and he was all smiles after the cameras were off back to the unfriendly expression.
All 60's spy thrillers function in context of where they figured into the James Bond series. Beyond mere copying of 007, most worked off blueprint of whichever Bond was recent, Assignment K being happy exception for beating JB to snowy backdrop that would inform much of On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Not that Bond wouldn't trump K once he got there, Assignment being winter scenery first and action a distant second. In fact, Stephen Boyd's toy tycoon who's also a Brit intelligence operative plays by such polite code that we're actually surprised to see him (finally) draw a gun. That restraint is actually what I liked about Assignment K; Boyd's just trying to run his business and do the Empire a good turn during off-hours. There is microfilm concealed in doll dresses, coded message rolled up in cigarette paper, a sort of stuff Hitchcock or someone at Gaumont might have dreamed up during the mid-30's. Again: part of Assignment K's charm. Want fast pace? Never mind it here ... forty minutes pass before anything like a story surfaces. Boyd has a neat London flat with hid, if cramped, passages where he can observe mystery men in cars and walking the street. He answers to Michael Redgrave, who I'll bet did his one-room scenes in a single day and had not faintest idea of what the heck dialogue meant. Proceeds don't get too technical --- a Get Smart episode delves deeper, but like I said, a plus. This was an international co-production with vivid location all over the continent. His light touch and relaxed presence makes me think Stephen Boyd would have made a better James Bond than too-soufflé Roger Moore. Did Saltzman/Broccoli consider Boyd before settling on single-shot replacement-for-Connery George Lazenby?
According to one site: "He was a serious contender for James Bond in the first film of the series, Dr. No (1962), but couldn’t be released from his Fox contract; he was waiting to start work as Marc Antony in Cleopatra (1963)." No idea if they ever thought about him later on. But Assignment K director Val Guest would soon be one of the ones responsible, if that's the word, for the overgrown spoof Casino Royale (1967).

In the trading world, you just can’t get rich on your own. You have to put your funds in a certain environment, work with the people facilitating the activities, and then live through the ups and downs of the market. All the while, you bear the hope that you’ll reap the rewards of your trading strategies in the end. This is why choosing the right broker is a major decision you have to make for your financial development. And there are a lot of brokers out there. To help you decide, we’ve prepared a review for one of them, FBS, and here are your must-knows about this company:
FBS is a young company (established only in 2009) but definitely a big and fast-growing soon-to-be-giant. They had 50,000 traders at the end of their first year – and that’s not few for a new brokerage company, we daresay – but, at present, they already have over 1,000,000 traders and partners combined! Their enormity is evidenced by the number of orders they execute daily: in the 100,000s. Perhaps this is attributable to the success traders experience when trading – more than half of them have increased their initial deposit by eight to ten times.
What is most notable about this company is that it is definitely award-winning. Since 2010, it has received at least one award, and in some years consistently won the same ones, such as the “Best mini Forex-broker” award and the “Best Broker in Asia” award, to name a few.
FBS attributes their continuous success to their efforts in providing excellent customer service. They provide a 24/5 support system, catering to both local and international clients (i.e. Japan, Spain, Korea, Indonesia, etc.). Their website features a simple and readily available chat service tool through which traders and users can key in their questions and receive responses in no time.
Registration is a breeze: you just have to enter your full name and email address, and you’re ready to go! You will be asked to change the temporary password they’ve assigned for you. After that, you will be given a pin code (Never lose this! This is required to confirm transactions done on your account) and other account information, such as your account number, your trading password, your trading server, and an investor password.
They have different trading accounts, each of which are designed to suit the unique and specific needs of their clients. From beginners to pros, from zero risks to unlimited gains, for insurance concerns and quick-trading needs – FBS has a trading account at the ready.
Initial deposits can be as small as a dollar to as high as $500 minimum (but, don’t worry, the large amount is for the pros). Spread may either be floating or fixed. Usual leverage can reach a max of 1:3,000.
They permit huge and numerous activities, keeping as little as 50 open positions to the normal 100, up to an unlimited number of pending orders (for the pros, of course). Order volumes are normally flexible, and market execution happens rather quickly.
FBS uses the MetaTrader 4 as their trading platform. They recognize its popularity and beneficial features, among which include: support for automated trading, low connection speed required, mobile trading, reliable trading, etc.
Starting an account with FBS bonus provides traders the following perks and benefits (terms and conditions apply as required): the chance to double their deposit (for greater profits!); an extra $123 FBS bonus for seven days; a chance to get up to $15 per order as cashback; and a brand new latest mobile phone gift after accumulating your lots to a certain volume.
There are a lot of other perks and benefits, such as deposit insurance and, well, chic and stylish shirts. Contests are also open almost all the time, such as the “share your dream” contest on Facebook and, of course, a risk-free trading tournament where real prize funds are won (as high as $450 for the first placer!).
We hope that the above information has helped you determine whether FBS could be your possible Forex broker. Once you’ve tried them out, let us know if your expectations were met.
Going through something akin to post-traumatic stress disorder following my forced exit from the Trotskyist movement after 11 years, I began looking for medical help for what turned out to be a psychosomatic low-grade fever. On the advice of my old friend Nelson Blackstock, who died 3 months ago, I picked up a copy of a book he recommended by Joel Kovel written in 1976 and titled “A complete guide to therapy: From psychoanalysis to behavior modification” as a kind of shopping guide. Nelson was particularly enthusiastic about behavior modification, whether specifically behavioral or cognitive, its offshoot. I only wished that I had looked into behavior modification before I joined the Socialist Workers Party in 1967.
Joel’s book is totally brilliant. Apart from being a shopper’s guide, it is permeated with a certain degree of skepticism about all these therapies since they so often fell short of dealing with the underlying problem, a sick society that could only become healthy through the overthrow of the capitalist system. He would make these ideas more focused in a 1988 book titled “The Radical Spirit” that was an attempt at synthesizing Marx and Freud. By this point, despite my post-Trotskyist depression having lifted, I jumped at the opportunity to register for a class on ecosocialism that Joel was giving at the Brecht Forum in N.Y. To this day, I can remember Joel explaining what the environmental crisis was about and can even see his face in front of me, with the words coming out of his mouth that struck me like a lightning bolt.
He said that capitalist growth is like a metastasizing tumor. Whether it is chemicals used for farming, plastics or aluminum, such highly profitable commodities also have the capability of killing human beings, animals and plants. This was in line with Barry Commoner’s “The Closing Circle” that I had read shortly before taking the class with Joel and that had also made an indelible impression on me.
Joel’s ideas eventually found their way into print in the 2007 “The Enemy of Nature” that can be read online. On page 39, he elaborates on the cancer metaphor:
We need to examine why we talk of capital as though it has a life of its own, which rapidly surpasses its rational function and consumes ecosystems in order to grow cancerously. Capital is not in itself a living organism, needless to say. It is, rather, a kind of relationship like that set up by a cancer-causing virus that invades living human beings, forces them to violate ecological integrity, sets up self-replicating structures, and polarizes the giant force field. It is humanity living as capital, people who become capital’s personifications, that destroys ecosystems.
After finishing Joel’s class at the Brecht Forum, I became a committed environmentalist and tried to persuade Marxists both on and off the Internet to become Green as well.
Around the same time, Joel and I both became passionately committed to the Sandinista revolution, which was for many of us in the 1980s a sign of hope for socialist renewal. Joel wrote “In Nicaragua” in 1988 as an act of solidarity in much the same way that my involvement with Tecnica was intended. When he lived in Nicaragua in 1986, Joel found himself drawn to the liberation theology wing of the Catholic Church that was a pillar of support for the Sandinistas. In a two-part article explaining his conversion to Christianity that appeared in Mondoweiss, Joel describes the initial and ineluctable attraction the church had for him:
The other thing is, every one of us that’s a leftist, with very few exceptions–we’re fearful. We’re afraid of the cops, afraid of the corporations, the authorities. Well, a common admonition in the New Testament is, Be not afraid, because I am with you. So you have that presence with you, and you’re not afraid. You’re not happy as a pig. You’re happy because you’re in the thick of the universal. I saw that in Nicaragua. I took communion at Casa Jesuitica. I made four trips and on one of them, we’re sitting around with the Jesuits. “Let’s have communion.” I said, “No no, oh no.”But they told me to stay, and we passed the bread and the wine. So I said, Well, ok, I’ll do it. It was the first time I did it. And it came around a table, there was no hierarchy. It was Ok– Ok. So I took communion. Then I said alright, I have to go home, I had to walk a half a mile to the place I was staying. And I was walking– I suddenly had a sense of I wasn’t walking anymore, I was floating through the air. Well how did that happen?
I guess I feel the same way about this sort of thing that I felt when Stan Goff turned to Jesus. Whatever gets you through the night…
In 1988, Joel Kovel was appointed to the Alger Hiss Chair of Social Studies at Bard College, my alma mater. A year earlier Leon Botstein, the school’s president for life, also appointed Martin Peretz to Bard’s board of trustees. This led me to write a letter (you remember what they were, right?) to Botstein complaining about the appropriateness of having a supporter of Nicaraguan contras, who were in the habit of burning down schools, to such a post. Leon was so stung by my letter that he took the trouble to write one reprimanding me. As you might expect, he argued that Bard did not apply litmus tests to board members. He was so much for free speech that he defended Bard College inviting a member of the neo-Nazi Alternative for Germany to speak at a conference on “Crises of Democracy: Thinking in Dark Times”.
Eleven years after his appointment, Joel learned that Botstein’s free speech absolutism did not include the right to attack the state of Israel. Two years before his firing, Joel wrote a book titled “Overcoming Zionism” that had become the target of the Israel lobby. The U. of Michigan Press came under so much pressure from its major donors that they dropped the book. (Eventually, counter-pressure forced them to reinstate it.) Do you think that Leon Botstein came to Joel’s right to academic freedom? Don’t be foolish. In an article on his firing, Joel recounts the circumstances:
2007. Overcoming Zionism was now on the market, arguing for a One-State solution (and sharply criticizing, among others, Martin Peretz for a scurrilous op-ed piece against Rachel Corrie in the Los Angeles Times. Peretz is an official in AIPAC’s foreign policy think-tank, and at the time a Bard Trustee — though this latter fact was not pointed out in the book). In August, Overcoming Zionism was attacked by a watchdog Zionist group, StandWithUs/Michigan, which succeeded in pressuring the book’s United States distributor, the University of Michigan Press, to remove it from circulation. An extraordinary outpouring of support (650 letters to U of M) succeeded in reversing this frank episode of book-burning. I was disturbed, however, by the fact that, with the exception of two non-tenure track faculty, there was no support from Bard in response to this egregious violation of the speech rights of a professor. When I asked President Botstein in an email why this was so, he replied that he felt I was doing quite well at taking care of myself.
This was irrelevant to the obligation of a college to protect its faculty from violation of their rights of free expression — all the more so, a college such as Bard with a carefully honed reputation as a bastion of academic freedom, and which indeed defines such freedom in its Faculty Handbook as a “right . . . to search for truth and understanding without interference and to disseminate his [sic] findings without intimidation.”
I am eagerly awaiting Joel’s final book, a memoir titled “The Lost Traveller’s Dream”, especially for its caustic take on his time at Bard that I browsed in Book Culture near Columbia University.
I had my political differences with Joel, especially when he was on the editorial board of “Capitalism, Nature and Socialism”. CNS had trouble with basing ecosocialism on Marx’s writings as Foster had done in “Marx’s Ecology”. To this day, I support Foster’s approach no matter how wrongheaded he has been about Syria. I summarized the debate between Monthly Review and CNS here: http://www.columbia.edu/~lnp3/mydocs/ecology/foster-o’connor.htm.
Joel was a true public intellectual, in the same league as Cornel West or David Harvey. He was also a friend. Not long after I moved into the Studebaker Building on in 2007 that was the initial outpost of Columbia University’s expansion into Manhattanville, I bumped into Joel a few blocks from my office. I was surprised and pleased to see him there. He explained that he had just moved into a co-op close by. From that point on, we used to have lunch together 2 or 3 times a year. I loved to draw him out on his experience at Bard as well as exchange ideas on the wretched American political situation. He was like me, incorporating pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the will.
At one point, I asked him to do a video interview that except for the crappy lighting was one of my better efforts. I will close with that.
It's been a while since last update for this blog, i've been away from my pc for about 3 weeks now and there's a lot of progress going on at the farm, prunning schedule has been completed, now it's a waiting time. Waiting for new shoots emerging from the cut down branches (or what's left of it). Actually, new shoots will emerges in 2 weeks (approx) time after every cutting or prunning, (if it's done in rainy season) but all of a sudden, came dry sunny season. Hmmm.. it's unpredictible when predicting weather nowadays, thanks to the global warming. But it's fine with me, the new shoots will come eventually. The sudden changes in wheather brings another good news... It's flowering time!!! Any trees that i've prunned during rainy season and have grown new shoots and leaves that have matured are now producing flowers.. Emmmmm.. How i miss that mango flower fragrance in the air... What a joy...
Actually, the leaves should have grown nicely, but thanks for the loose cattle that broke my fences creating havocs and ate the nice, yummy shoots.... i've to wait some more time. Hmmmm... 'lagi2 lembu!!' Nowadays, every morning routine i'm doing in my farm is patroling and checking the fences for traces of damages or 'leaks'. But news from the Dept. of Agriculture came to my relief. JPS (Dept of irrigation and drainage) will be doing maintenance for my perimeter drainage by making it deeper and bigger. And there goes my cattle woes. (i hope). But works will only commence on June (i think) as there are National Election coming soon. But on the mean time, the routine goes on.
Oklah... I think enough said already.. With all the sudden changes in language with broken english and lots of grammatical errors, i think that's all for today's post. Just brushing things up, it's been a while i've stop written and spoken in english. My 'otak pun dah berkarat' hahahahaha.... next time in bahasa like 'ususal' hehehehe....
There is so much to see and do in and around Sheffield. Sheffield offers a dazzling array of attractions, so the City can promise something for the family from historic buildings; award-winning museums and galleries; an enviable theatre and live music programme; to world class sporting venues. Sheffield is the greenest city in Europe; 61% of the city is green space and with over two million trees it has more trees per person than any other city in Europe. With a third of the city’s boundary lying within the UK’s most visited National Park, the Peak District, the biggest choice you’ll need to make is just how long to stay!
If your interest is cultural or industrial heritage, there’s so much to discover. Pride and Prejudice was filmed on location at Chatsworth House, while Mary Queen of Scots was a frequent visitor to Sheffield and nearby Hardwick Hall. The industrial museums offer a fascinating insight into why Sheffield was, and is, the world leader in cutlery and steel making.
If you are looking for something more active, choose from the extensive range of sporting facilities. These include Europe’s largest all-season ski resort, Olympic standard swimming facilities, a choice of golf courses, ice skating and rock climbing. from racing, golf and wine tours to visitor attractions and family friendly activities and excursions. For more information on all the local attractions in Sheffield and the Peak Distriict in particular, use the links to the left of the image above.

I just wrote out the most beautiful post ever about the genious and what I think it is, and of course an error occured. You know what I said? FISH! it stands for "F#$% it shit happens" And here goes my journy to bring back the post that will never be as good.
I tend to get hurt.... a lot, and when I get hurt I tend to say some weird things. Now, I don't remember saying these things, but I think it lets you take a sneak peak at my genious. No I don't think that there is a phantom that sings to me in my sleep but I think that our subconcious is all of your geniouses. You will never know where your first impulse will put you because you will never let it out, you always have to think about it first.
Saying what ever comes to mind isn't always great, I'd say it's a curse as well. When you give your impulesesesessss some walking around money... or just some freedom to be heard, you get some weird looks like you are crazy. However they say that most geniouses are crazy, so am I crazy or am I a genious?
I'm gettin a lil bit more bawlzy with the things I disclose about my self, I figgure that two or three people read this so if they figgure out who I am before the end I don't really care.
So here's my real post. I SHOULD NOT BE THIS TIRED FROM SUCH LITTLE RIDING! I have literaly crawled every where this morning, you think I'm kidding, but I crawled outta bed and up the stairs to type this, and back down the stairs to get some food and back up.... why am I so tired? Because motocross is the most badass sport! Swimming is the only sport that uses more muscles! To all of you that think you just twist a throttle and go, you are dead wrong! You try doing a million squat thrusts, while holding on with your hands and legs to a bar for dear life. You try to man handle a 230 pound machine into a rut that is only 4 inches wide while going 30 mph! oh what? does that sound diffcult? Now go do that for 30 min straight!
I could rant about this for days... but i got other posts to do. If you would like to object to my statements, please comment so I can rip you a new one, and fill that new one with mind busting knowlage.
What's an ordinary day for this hero? oh you know, He just wakes up at the butt-crack of dawn to blast his pecs (you gotta blast those pecs) after an impressive amount of pec blasting he showers (you gotta smell fresh after the pec blasting) and goes to school (you gotta get yo knowlage on) after school he goes... to more school (he's a brainiac braiiiiniac on the roll, and he's learning like he's never learned before) and then goes to work (gettin the dolla dolla bills yo)
On the weekends he also wakes up at the ass-crack of dawn to go get his ride on (natural hight #ladiesloveit) and if he doesnt get hurt (not too often) then he proceeds to go more badassery later in the night (such as riding donkeys)
I started out and I was gunna make my self sound badass but then I ran out of creative juice (I was entertaining my[I am using a lot of perenthesisieseisisissiess] coworkers all day)
What the hell? I don't wanna download google chrome, do you have any idea how long that will take on this internet connection? Can the creators of any mutha luvin website be happy with their set up for more then like three days? I cant even see half of the blog because blogger is all fuzzed up (yeah, I'm watching my language now, just for this blog) sweet moses this is the most difficult thing ever!
"after years of school, grew up poor." my scanner isn't working... and I have to be at work in 30 min so i can't fix it at the moment, so this will have to do untill then. Sorry Nels
I finaly remembered my password! I feel like such a dumbass forgetting it and getting so far behind! When I could finaly see my emails again i was alerted that my shipment of fresh clothing was here along with "ways to get ripped fast" cool huh?
Austin Powers; I watch all 3 at least once a month.... is this where i get my humor? probobly so. it's nfortunate but yes I am that immature

It has been our pleasure to serve Toronto fine Thai food for the past 20 years. In fact, we were one of the first restaurants to popularize Thai food in the city. As Toronto.com says, we are "Thai'd and true."
Over the years Golden Thai has been lauded with plenty of good reviews from the local press and have often won the Readers’ polls in Now Magazine, Eye Weekly, and the Toronto Sun. We have also frequently placed among the top restaurants in Toronto in the Zagat survey, as well as Patron’s Pick. What really makes us proud is that we have countless regular customers who began visiting us when we first opened. It is pretty clear that Golden Thai has become an “institution” with Toronto diners.
Our executive chef Kiem Thung draws on 30 years experience to create over 90 flavorful dishes. From luscious Thai curries, to spicy sweet basil dishes, to tangy tamarind sauces, to zesty ginger stir fries it is obvious why Kiem’s kitchen deserves the following it has gained.
We accept reservations for parties of a maximum of 6 through our answering machine service. For parties over 6, please call in person to discuss the reservations.
We regret we cannot provide separate cheques. 15% service charge will be added to a party of 6 people and up, on the discretion of the server.
Accra, 8 March 2018: Gold Fields Ghana Limited (GFGL) has formally begun the transition from owner mining to contract mining at its Tarkwa gold mine. This follows a decision by the Accra High Court on 2 March 2018, dismissing an injunction application by the Ghana Mine Workers’ Union’s (GMWU) which sought to restrain the Company from issuing severance letters to employees who will be affected by the contract mining operation.
Subsequent to the Court’s ruling, the majority of the employees at the mining and equipment maintenance departments at Tarkwa have signed their severance letters, an exercise that was carried out peacefully and orderly.
About 1,850 employees in total are to be affected by the transition to contract mining. Of these, 1,300 employees have already signed their severance agreement letters, with the remainder scheduled to commence the process over the next couple of weeks.
As per an agreement between GFGL and the contractors, about 80 – 85 per cent of these employees will be re-engaged by the contractors, under fair and equitable remuneration terms. As part of their severance package from GFGL these employees will also benefit from three months’ gross salary for every year that thing interviews and other employment processes with the new contractors.
The transition process being explained to employees on the evening shift The transition process being explained to a section of the employees on the mine
Under the contract mining model, the mining and equipment maintenance activities at Tarkwa will be managed by two contractors, both of whom are fully-owned Ghanaian entities. GFGL will continue to directly manage the other aspects of the business, including exploration and processing.
GFGL’s adoption of the contract mining model allows for the sustainability of the Tarkwa operations through investment in exploration and potential extension of the life of the mine, which will have significant benefits for communities, employees, investors, as well as the Government of Ghana.
At the initial stage of the severance-letters-signing-exercise, some security personnel were deployed at the mine’s main access gate to protect employees from outsiders and a small minority of staff members who are opposed to the contract mining model and who had attempted to forcibly disrupt the process. It is important to note that the security personnel were not in the vicinity of the offices where employees signed the documents and had no meaningful contact with the employees.

This study guide, which I also refer to as a course outline and a road map, gives you a structured and instructive outline for learning JavaScript properly. In fact, you will find two study guides below, one for absolute beginners and the other for experienced programmers and web developers.
You do want to learn JavaScript. I presume you are here for that reason, and you have made a wise decision. For if you want to develop modern websites and web applications (including an internet startup), or if you want a high-paying developer job ($75K to $250K+), JavaScript is undoubtedly the best web-development language to learn today, unless you want to develop native iOS or Android apps exclusively. And while there exist ample online resources to teach you JavaScript, finding the most efficient and beneficial method to learn the “language of the web” can be a frustrating endeavor. This study guide streamlines and simplifies the process; it has proven successful in helping thousands, and thousands more read and follow it each day.
People have started study groups for this study guide. You can find such groups on Reddit here and here, and other places, including Code Crew Meetup.
Maybe you will look more lovely and have a kinder, more pleasant personality after you learn JavaScript properly. Who knows? I don’t know.
But I do know that you will emerge more confident, more assured in your ability, and amply trained with a highly valued skill—a skill more valuable than most college degrees. For as a JavaScript developer, you will have the capacity not only to create whatever startup or web app you imagine, but also to work, making a handsome salary, as a front-end or full-stack developer, developing modern and futuristic applications. In fact, if you have never developed any kind of application before, you will experience ecstasy, so exultant and euphoric that you will want to enthusiastically practice more and build something—anything, like a hungry chef discovering a furnished kitchen with every tool, every utensil, and a stocked refrigerator.
It is worth noting that unlike just a couple of years ago—when you needed to know a true server-side language (such as PHP, Rails, Java, Python, or Perl) to develop scalable, dynamic, and database-driven web applications—today you can do as much and more with JavaScript alone.
This course outline transcends an entire semester of college coursework. If you complete the study guide, you will have learned enough programming to develop modern web applications, and with a bit of experience and a couple of completed projects, you will have become a sought-after programmer. Indeed, JavaScript developers are in high demand today. But you must prove your worth by developing a few impressive (interesting and non-trivial, though not necessarily complex) web applications.
    &lt;li&gt;Do not try to learn JavaScript the first time from bits of unrelated or related JavaScript tutorials online; this is the worst way to learn a programming language. It could work for some after countless such tutorials, but it is an inefficient process that lacks the proper hierarchical structure needed for learning a subject matter thoroughly. And this could lead to your being stuck quite frequently, when you start to build websites and web applications with the language. In short, you will not have the know-how—the comprehensive knowledge—you need to use that language as a tool—as your tool.
    &lt;li&gt;In addition, some will recommend you learn JavaScript from “JavaScript: The Good Parts,” by the venerable Douglas Crockford. While many regard Mr. Crockford as a JavaScript godfather, his book, &lt;em&gt;The Good Parts&lt;/em&gt;, is not the best JavaScript book for beginners. It does not explain JavaScript's core concepts in a detailed, clear, and easily digestible form. I do recommend you follow Crockford's advanced videos, however, as part of the &lt;a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/learn-intermediate-and-advanced-javascript/" title="Learn Intermediate and Advanced JavaScript" target="_blank"&gt;Learn Advanced JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; road map.
    &lt;li&gt;And do not try to learn the language by using only Codecademy; while you will learn how to program bits of small JavaScript tasks, you will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; have learned enough to build complex web applications. Nonetheless, below I do recommend Codecademy as a supplemental learning resource.
I have outlined two different study guides below, one for beginners and one for experienced web developers.
Sign up for an account on Stack Overflow (a FREE service). It is a forum for asking and answering programming questions. This website will be considerably more useful than Codecademy for answering your programming questions, even very basic, seemingly stupid (remember, there is never a stupid question) questions.
Sign up for an account on Codecademy. We will complete 4 Codecademy tracks. Codecademy is an online platform to learn programming: you can write code on their website, right in your browser. (It is also a FREE service.)
— Notice for Visual Learners: If you are a visual learner, that is, if you prefer to see lots of images, schematics, and the like when learning a topic, you may find JavaScript and jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development more appealing than the Beginning JavaScript book. If you do get the JavaScript and jQuery book, note that the chapters are similar enough that you can use it (instead of Beginning JavaScript) to follow this study guide, though you will have to modify the sections a bit.
Type out and test every example code you encounter in the book. You can type the code and tweak it (experiment with it) in Firefox’s or Chrome’s console. The browser console is an area of the browser where you can write and run JavaScript code. Or use JSFiddle. JSFiddle is a web application that allows you to write and test your code online, right in your browser. You can test all sorts of code, including a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and jQuery).
Codecademy.com: Then follow the Make a Website track to make your first little website, using what you learned above.
Codecademy.com: Work through the JavaScript Track on Codecademy. Specifically, work through these sections: “Introduction to JavaScript,” “Functions,” “‘For’ Loops in JavaScript,” “‘While’ Loops in JavaScript,” and “Control Flow.”
Codecademy.com: Work through the last three sections of the Codecademy JavaScript track: “Data Structures,” “Objects 1,” and “Objects 2.”
Codecademy.com: Now, make your first cool website. Work through the entire Make an Interactive Website track on Codecademy.
At this juncture, you have learned enough to build a solid JavaScript web application. Don’t proceed any further until you can successfully build this application I describe below. Don’t be afraid to ask questions on Stack Overflow, and do reread sections of the book to properly understand the concepts.
You are building a JavaScript quiz web application (you will use HTML and CSS as well) that will function as follows:
It is a simple quiz that has radio button choices, and it will show the quiz taker his or her score upon completion.
Use an array to store all the questions. Each question, along with its choices and correct answer, should be stored in an object. The array of questions should look similar to this (Notice that only one question is in this example array; you will add many questions):
var allQuestions = [{question: "Who is Prime Minister of the United Kingdom?", choices: ["David Cameron", "Gordon Brown", "Winston Churchill", "Tony Blair"], correctAnswer:0}];
You can ask for help in the comments below or preferably on Stack Overflow. You will likely to get a prompt and accurate answer on Stack Overflow.
You should be very comfortable with JavaScript, probably feeling like a Jedi. No, you are not. Not yet. You must keep using your newly acquired knowledge and skills as often as possible to keep learning and improving.
Add client-side data validation: make sure the user answers each question before proceeding to the next question.
Add a “Back” button to allow the user to go back and change her answer. The user can go back up to the first question. For the questions that the user has answered already, be sure to show the radio button selected, so that the user is not forced to answer the questions again, which she has completed.
Add user authentication: allow users to log in, and save their login credentials to local storage (HTML5 browser storage).
— Use Twitter Bootstrap for the entire page layout, including the quiz elements to make it look more polished. As an added bonus, use the tabs user interface component from Twitter Bootstrap and show 4 different quizzes, one on each tab.
— Learn Handlebars.js and add Handlebars.js templating to the quiz. You should no longer have any HTML in your JavaScript code. Your quiz is getting more advanced, bit by bit.
— Keep a record of all the users who take the quiz and show each user how his or her score ranks among the scores from other quiz takers.
Later (after you have learned Backbone.js and Node.js or Meteor.js), you can use these technologies to refactor your quiz code and turn the same quiz into a sophisticated, single-page, modern web application built with the latest JavaScript frameworks. And you will store the users’ authentication credentials and scores in a MongoDB database.
Next: Decide on a personal project to build, and start building your project promptly (while everything remains fresh in your memory). Use the book as a reference. And of course be an active member on Stack Overflow: ask questions and answer other programmers’ questions. I am confident you will be able to answer a number of questions.
Prerequisite: You should know at least some programming basics and how to build a simple HTML/CSS website.
You will learn just about the full JavaScript language (and jQuery and some HTML5) in 6 to 8 weeks, if you complete this entire course outline. If you don’t have enough time to commit to do all the sections in 6 weeks (which is a relatively aggressive schedule), try to do it in no more than 8 weeks. The longer you take, the harder it will be for you to grasp and remember everything you learn.
If you do not already know HTML and CSS very well, complete the Web Fundamentals Track on Codecademy.
Or Read the Preface and Chapters 3 and 4 of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers. You can skip the section on “Bitwise Operators”; it is hardly likely you will use those in your JavaScript career.
And again, make sure you stop and write the example code in your browser’s console (or JSFiddle) and experiment—change some of the variables and tweak the code a bit.
Read chapter 5 of JavaScript: The Definitive Guide. No reading for Professional JavaScript for Web Developers, you have learned the material already in the last chapter.
Any of the 3 is fine, although the 2 textbooks go into more detail: the extra detail you can skip confidently, if you read and thoroughly understand my post.
At this juncture, you should be spending a lot of time writing code in your browser’s console and testing if-else statements, for loops, Arrays, Functions, Objects, and more. It is critically important that you know (and keep practicing) how to code independently (without help from Codecademy) in your browser. By the time you get back to Codecademy, you shouldn’t need any help or hints. Every assignment should be easy for you.
If you are still struggling with Codecademy, go back to your browser and keep hacking away. This is where you will learn the most. This is analogous to Lebron James honing his skills as a youth in the “streets” (the neighborhood basketball courts), or to Bill Gates hacking away in his basement.
There is tremendous value in your hacking away and learning bit by bit on your own. You have to see the value in this strategy, and you have to embrace it and trust that it will work.
The biggest problem with Codecademy is that the hints and little code snippets help you so much that you have a false sense of accomplishment when you are progressing through the exercises easily. You wouldn’t know it at the time, but much of what you are doing is not on your own.
Now, Codecademy is still great for helping you to learn how to code, particularly in the manner in which it guides you through the process of developing small projects and small applications from very basic code constructs like if statements, for loops, functions, and variables.
Return to Codecademy and complete the JavaScript track by working through sections 6, 7, and 8 (Data Structures to Object 2).
While you are on Codecademy, go ahead and build the 5 little Basic Projects on the Projects track. After this, you are done with Codecademy. And this is a good thing, because the more you work on your own, the faster you will learn and the better prepared you will be to start programming on your own.
Or read chapters 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14 of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers. This book does not cover jQuery, and the jQuery coverage on Codecademy is insufficient. Follow this jQuery course—it is free: http://try.jquery.com/
And you can read chapter 19 of JavaScript: The Definitive Guide, if you have the book, for more on jQuery.
Before you build your first project, if you plan to be a JavaScript developer or use JavaScript often, you should take a break now and download a trial copy of WebStorm. Learn how to get started with WebStorm here (written especially for this course).
WebStorm is unquestionably the absolute best editor (IDE) for programming JavaScript. It costs $49.00 when your 30-day trial period expires, but it is probably the best investment you will make as a JavaScript developer, besides buying the book you are using in this course and learning JavaScript.
Make sure you set WebStorm to use JSHint. JSHint is a “tool to detect errors and potential problems in JavaScript code and to enforce your team’s coding conventions.” The cool thing with using WebStorm is that JSHint automatically adds a red line under errors in your code, just as a spell checker does in a word processing application. So JSHint will show you all the errors in your code (including HTML errors) and make you a better JavaScript programmer, even as you are learning. This is extremely important. You will thank me later after you realize how much WebStorm and JSHint have helped you become a better programmer.
Moreover, WebStorm is a world-class, professional-grade IDE for coding professional JavaScript web applications, so you will use it a lot. And it integrates Node.js, Git, and other JavaScript frameworks, so even after you have become a rock star JavaScript developer, you will be using it, unless a more compelling JavaScript IDE comes out in the next few months.
It is fair that I also mention Sublime Text 2, which is the next best JavaScript editor. But it is not as feature rich and complete (even with numerous add-on packages) as WebStorm. I use Sublime Text 2 to make small edits to files of different programming languages, including JS files. But I don’t use it to program full JavaScript web applications.
At this juncture, you have learned enough to build a solid web application that is manageable. Don’t proceed any further until you can successfully build this application I describe below. As I noted earlier, if you are stuck, ask questions on Stack Overflow and reread sections of the book to properly understand the concepts.
You are building a JavaScript quiz application (you will use HTML and CSS as well) that will function as follows:
It is a simple quiz that has radio button choices, and it will show the user her score upon completion.
Use an array to store all the questions. Each question, along with its choices and correct answer, should be stored in an object. The array of questions should look similar to this:
// Only one question is in this array, but you will add all the questions.var allQuestions = [{question: "Who is Prime Minister of the United Kingdom?", choices: ["David Cameron", "Gordon Brown", "Winston Churchill", "Tony Blair"], correctAnswer:0}];
You can ask for help in the comments below or preferably on Stack Overflow. You are likely to get a prompt and accurate answer on Stack Overflow.
Remember to keep typing out all the example codes in Firefox console and tweak each piece of code to experiment with it to really understand how it works and what it does.
At this point, you should be very comfortable with JavaScript, probably feeling like a Jedi. You are not quite a Jedi yet, you must keep using your newly acquired knowledge and skills as often as possible to keep learning and improving.
— Add client-side data validation: make sure the user answers each question before proceeding to the next question.
— Add a “Back” button to allow the user to go back and change her answer. The user can go back up to the first question. For the questions that the user has answered already, be sure to show the radio button selected, so that the user is not forced to answer the questions again, which she has completed.
Or read chapters 6 (only the “Object Creation” and “Inheritance” sections this time) 16, 22, and 24 of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers. NOTE: The reading in this section of the book is the most technical reading you will encounter in this entire road map. It is up to you if you want to read all of it. You should at least learn the Prototype Pattern, Factory Pattern, and Prototypal Inheritance. You don’t have to know all the other patterns.
— Use Twitter Bootstrap for the entire page layout, including the quiz elements to make it look more professional. As an added bonus, use the tabs user interface component from Twitter Bootstrap and show 4 different quizzes, one on each tab.
— Learn Handlebars.js and add Handlebars.js templating to the quiz. You should no longer have any HTML in your JavaScript code. Your quiz is getting more advanced bit by bit.
— Keep a record of all the users who take the quiz and show each user how her score ranks amongst the scores from other quiz takers.
Later (after you have learned Backbone.js and Node.js), you will use these two technologies to refactor your quiz code and turn the same quiz into a sophisticated, single-page, modern web application built with the latest JavaScript frameworks. And you will store the users’ authentication credentials and scores in a MongoDB database.
Next: Decide on a personal project to build, and start building your project promptly (while everything is fresh in your mind).
Alternatively, if you want to develop complete applications, that is, the front-end and the backend, learn Meteor.js properly.
At this point, you will definitely need my book, MongoDB for JavaScript Applications, to help you build your own jQuery, Backbone.js, Node.js, or Meteor.js applications, since none of the noted resources, or any other book for that matter, cover MongoDB in depth for JavaScript applications.
I wish you success with your studies and in your JavaScript career. Never give up! When you are struggling and feeling incompetent (you may from time to time), always remember that most (probably all) programmers, new and experienced alike, feel this way sometimes, or have felt this way at some point during their programming career.
Remember to dig deep and don’t get frustrated; just carry on and stick with the task until you figure it out, for a worthwhile reward awaits you when you triumph in the end: programming is fun, liberating, and lucrative. The ecstasy one gets from building an application is a powerful feeling that you must experience to understand. Even more satisfying, however, is the empowerment you experience when you realize you have attained the skill and knowledge to build applications from scratch, to change the world with any idea you dream up.
The moment will come when you realize that all the difficulties you endured were worth while. Just as the millions before you have triumphed, so too, you will vanquish the toughest bugs, master the incomprehensible topics, and overcome the seemingly impossible tasks.

Excellent! I am just starting to learn javascript and getting a good outline like this is perfect! Thanks!
C programming is not required to learn javascript . If you want, I will teach you javascript. Please reach me on my email.
I need help in understand JS, Is there any way that you can contact. Please, I would appreciate your time so much.
I am looking for some good javascript tutorials and got Codecademy – it was fun doing it, but could not get much out of it.
Hello Sanjay, I have basic programming skills. But on my new job, I need to learn JavaScript rather quickly.
Sanjay, would love to learn Js xxlesterlongxx@gmail.com is my email. would appreciete if you would reach out. thank you
@ratnabh Tell me a bit about yourself and what you want to learn and your career plans. I will help you out.
This message is for everyone else as well who is lost about what to learn and who want to change their career to become a programmer or improve their programming skills for a better programming job.
Feel free to email me. See the About page for my email. I rarely check my gmail email, so if you want a relatively quick reply (within a week; I am quite inundated right now), email by BovAcademy email.
I’m also trying to learn Javascript, and I know that sometimes it’s difficult to impose oneself a discipline to learn a new language. Because of this, I appreciate your advices. Thanks!.
Note that I have just updated the post above with the jQuery course on Code Academy, which I mistakenly forgot to add.
This is fantastic!! I started with week 1 just yesterday! I would always get into codeacademy and would either get stuck or stop…this is a great roadmap that is easy to follow.
Jeff, I am happy to hear you have started learning JavaScript. Congratulations, you will be very happy you did, because you can do a lot, just about everything, with JavaScript nowadays.
As for a server-side language, the hot languages for startups and modern web applications are Rails, Python, and Scala (for larger web apps). But, with your JavaScript skills, you can use Node.js or Meteor.js (the future for web application development), and you need not learn a new programming language.
And it is worth noting that Meteor.js and Node.js are two of the fastest growing server-side frameworks today. So, if I had to tell you to learn one server-side language, I would say learn JavaScript very well, enough that you can use it skillfully to make any web application. Then learn Meteor.js and or Node.js and you would be preparing yourself for future web application development.
Having said that, it is always good to know at least one server-side language, and you cannot go wrong with Python or Rails, especially Rails.
I finished the web fundamentals course on Codeacademy and started JavaScript track, but I’m gonna switch to your course because it’s definitelly true that everything seems easy on Codeacademy but not so much when you try it on your own!
Just a short question, is there any special reason why you suggest Rails over Python (i guess we are talking about Django framework here)? Is it because of the better library or it’s just your personal preference? People say Python is more similar to natural language and thus easier to master.
Thanks for the reply!! I had learned enough PHP and Javascript to slap together a site, but perhaps as I work through this I can rewrite my little project using node instead. Thanks again for the awesome roadmap! Already most of the way through chapter 3 and looking forward to getting back into codecademy.
That is very good question, and I did ponder adding a web project to accompany the advanced chapters in the two JS books. But because I had not done the proper research to find the ideal project for the advanced chapters, I did not add a project to the post.
I will do the proper research over the next 2-3 days and update the post above with a web project for week 4.
Yeah I would like your suggestions for which web application projects we should do in week 4. So that way we can learn JS in properly way.
I’d really appreciate an Angular.js tutorial. I’m trying to pick a “goto” javascript framework (yes, I know one tool doesn’t fit every job but it’s nice to have one you know well enough to prototype apps) and Angular is looking good, except I have no idea how to manipulate the DOM, and since it’s new there aren’t many resources.
Colin and Michael, I will likely add a post on Angular.js in about 3 – 5 weeks, sometime after I add the Node.js and Backbone.js posts, amongst other.
I’ve been trying to get to be able to write production level JS code. I’ve played around with JavaScript for a while but haven’t really used it for anything other than simple programs similar to the ones at Codecademy.
Finally, some guidance! I was hopelessly jumping from one book review to another and now I see hope!! 😀
Have you ever taken a look on CodeAvengers.com. I stopped learning JS on codecademy after realizing I was making little improvement. I learned Java back in college, so I had little experience with coding and most syntax used in programming languages (that’s not to say the two are similar but some thought process is common in different languages). Avengers was more thorough and forced you to work on tasks as opposed to academy’s way of chewing things for you. Plus, it was very easy for me after a week to be able to use my coding experience to build a simple website that, say, asks you for 2 numbers and gives you the sum and/or product. Learning on academy feels very different to applying JS on html. It doesn’t even tell you how to nest your script on HTML code.
Took delivery of the first book today… its massive! Looking forward to getting stuck in. Thanks for your guidance.
For your information, the URL to the Javascript track at Codecademy you use in your article points to a newer version of this track. The URL to the track you are reffering to is http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript-original
I just want to mention I am beginner to blogs and truly liked you’re web-site. Likely I’m want to bookmark your blog . You certainly have incredible articles and reviews. Thanks for sharing with us your website page.
but i see now that your post is not a to the date with the code academy site i spouse they changed the site (the are no further section then 8) so if you can post a new guide using the code academy it will be very appricited!!!
Thank you a lot Richard, I’m in JavaScript world about 3-4 year, but i fell something missing in my knowledge and this program will fix it
Just wanted to confirm that this book is indeed appropriate for the beginner w/o a background in programming. Many of the reviews warn beginners that this book isn’t for beginners so I’m a bit concerned.
➤ Experienced developers familiar with object-oriented programming who are looking to learn JavaScript as it relates to traditional OO languages such as Java and C++.
➤ Web application developers attempting to enhance the usability of their web sites and web applications.
But since you are using Codecademy along with the book, and taking in to account the manner in which I setup the course outline, I believe you will make it through the course, though you should go at a much slower pace.
Codecademy will be very helpful for you (you needn’t have any programming background), and definitely read the corresponding chapters in the book so that you can better understand what you are learning on Codecademy.
Great. I’m going for it. I’ve been doing the JavaScript track on CodeAcademy already and have had great success with the general syntax. Sometimes I’m getting bogged down on the logic side of things. Hopefully the book will better shed light on why and how to structure my code.
I just want to say I am all new to blogging and site-building and definitely loved you’re website. Almost certainly I’m going to bookmark your site . You absolutely have tremendous articles. Regards for sharing your web page.
Do you have any thoughts on the book Eloquent Javascript? I have heard it recommended quite often for beginners, plus the web version is free.
I actually tried Eloquent JavaScript when I was learning JavaScript a while ago, but I did not find it as thorough and as instructive as I needed it to be, to teach me JavaScript properly. So I didn’t use it it much and I went ahead and buy the 2 books I noted in the post.
I didn’t jive with that book as well, in fact the Wrox book is a good read, I like his approach and style, Zakas is a guru!
The Main problem i have had when learning to code is not having a complete roadmap to follow. Its so annoying, and i have just been dumping money everywhere.
This is an exciting solution because no matter how abstract the concept i am leatrning may be at a particular time, i am confident that if i go through it, i will be able to build something at the end. That and as the Javascript language has been the most friendly to me over the past 3 months(and i have tried ruby and python).
Thanks a lot for providing this guidance. It’s really super-helpful if someone picks a selection of resources among the vast amount of what’s out there.
I just started this course by taking the ‘Web Fundamentals’ track on Codeacademy, and it seems they have changed the structure a bit. There are no chapters 7 and 8 on JavaScript anymore in this track. So you might want to check your course elements that involve Codeacademy tracks and chapters.
Also, I was really surprised to see that the tracks and lessons on Codeacademy are actually free (they are, aren’t they?). Maybe include this explicitly in your course outline, so that people won’t be put off by thinking they would have to pay for it.
You made some good points, Flo. I will find some time soon to update the post to match the new JavaScript track on Codecademy. And I will note that it is free
Try throwing in a spaced repetition program such as [Anki] to help you retain your knowledge. The problem is syntax and retention and if you use those flash cards that you create you’ll be well on your way on the path to mastery!
I code in js, ruby, python and php as well as playing with BackboneJS and friends, so remember the syntax is a problem
Anyone wanting to learn JavaScript should definitely give http://codeavengers.com ago. It is much more fun and effective for beginners than CodeCademy.
Thanks for sharing this. In your opinion would it be ok to buy the JavaScript ebooks and learn off the Kindle?
My initial thoughts were the screen is quite small and might be a pain having to flick back and forth as you tend to do with a large technical book. What do you think?
I used to prefer reading from PDF eBooks, until I got my iPad and quickly learned that no matter the subject matter, it is a pleasurable, engrossing experience reading on the iPad. So I buy all my books for the iPad nowadays. Making notes, adding bookmarks, and searching the book are super easy compared with reading a paper book or PDF book.
And I suspect the experience is similar on the Kindle. So, if the Kindle is your preferred reading device, you should get the books for the Kindle.
I did something similar for Ruby & Rails (http://astonj.com/tech/best-way-to-learn-ruby-rails/) and have been looking for something similar for JS for ages!
Thanks for this post. This is exactly what I needed. I have absolutely no programming background but am now getting more and more comfortable with the language.
I wanted to reach out to get some tips on applying all this material in the reading b/c 1,000+ pages is A LOT of reading. I’ve followed your instructions to practice on Codecademy. My experience with Codecademy has been inconsistent — some of their lessons are great but others not so much.
With all the reading, there are a lot of concepts that aren’t really sinking in. What other ways would you suggest that I get these concepts soaked in and apply my learning. I have been supplementing your track with youtube videos on concepts I don’t fully grasp. Should I just start building my idea now or wait till weeks 5 & 6?
I do realize the roadmap is not ideal (it could be a lot better) for beginners, and it is not streamlined for people who already have some programming experience.
To fix this problem and to make the instructions more tailored, I will create two separate roadmaps: one for beginners and one for experienced programmers. And I will create an eBook to help both groups.
Wow, thanks man. This is great. I am starting this roadmap ASAP. I have already been on Code Academy and Treehouse, but this is such a detailed and intentional roadmap. I think it will work well for me. I am looking forward to the beginners road map.
Definitely start building your project or building small projects ON YOUR OWN (not in Codecademy) as soon as you can. Do this from day 2.
I just started with your suggestions on learning JavaScript. I’ve been trying to learn for a few months using codeacademy and tutorials in the net. This is the first time I’m going to follow a book. Hope it helps.
Excellent post. I’m learning Javascript during the last month with the Team Tree House Course and with the book Eloquent Javascript, but I think that I’m now in a good level. Do you recommend to start from scratch and follow this guide? Now I’m starting with jQuery and with backbone
It seems Codeacdemy has changed it’s track structure. Javascript fundamentals doesnt have anything like Chapter 11 and 12. Chapter 8th is the last one.
Thanks, Arun, I will update the article in a few days to reflect the Codecademy changes. I have to make two new roadmaps, as I have noted above; one for absolute beginners and one for programmers with some experience.
I’ve tried this approach to learning a language before and I find that it hinders the process more than anything. You get caught up in syntactical details instead of seeing the big picture the author is trying to convey.
My personal recommendation is to read the chapters, and then think of a feature that each thing you read about can be used for in the context of a larger application. Alternatively, if you still want to type out the examples, maybe use a see, copy, do approach where you read the chapter once, copy the examples, and then use them in your own app. This takes a fair bit longer though!
Thanks for the challenge! I’v been flirting with JS for ages but never found it never stuck I even ticked of all three of your starter ‘not to’, made me laugh.
I’v been doing a 9 week online course ‘Introduction to Databases’ and the more formal structure has made it far more beneficial than lots of little blog post opinions scattered all over the web. So really looking forward to your path as well.
Just got the books through as well, was a heavy box. Feel like I got good value, just may take a while
I’m very excited to follow the more regimented program that you’ve offered here. I don’t want to take too much of your time here. However, I was wondering if you’d answer a few very short questions for me and your audience:
1. Aside from learning from tutorials, scattered knowledge in books, etc… what is the most common mistake novice programmers make when learning Javascript?
2. Do you know of anyone who struggled with programming, but learned JS (or another language) regardless of their ineptitude? If so, what about their approach was effective in your opinion?
3. After completing your course, what type of application could a student build to impress potential employers – showing off their JS proficiency?
Great questions John. I am looking forward to the answers. Thanks for a great blog Richard. It will be essential to my further education as a developer.
I answered all of your questions. Look at the bottom of this post (above the comments), I added a section called: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers.
Thank you SO much, Richard. GREAT tips there. Going to get started this week! I’ll make sure to document the process on my blog and link back here!
I always learned javascript / jQuery just enough to solve any problems I had and never bothered to learn it properly.
Thanks for this great post. I’m just wondering when the announced “master in 1 week” blog post will come. Any news on that?
Somewhat the courses all are somewhat decent explaining a if/then statement but more help for practical applications/small projects would be awesome.
It is my fault. I was too optimistic with the time estimate. I know a lot of readers are waiting eagerly for the update. I am hopeful the post will be helpful.
I will upload the absolute beginner update shortly (about 1-1/2 hour from now). With the advanced and experienced programmers posts to follow a few hours after that.
To everyone waiting eagerly: I am sorry about the delay. Drink a cup of tea or coffee and watch some Oscars and come back in about 2 hours :). It will be ready for sure by then. Or read chapter 1 of “JavaScript, The Definitive Guide” in the mean time.
Hey Richard have you tried out sublime text 2? I personally use this one because if its vast features
I do use it, but not for full JS applications. Only to edit files. I added a note about this to the post.
Thanks so much for this, Richard. I am an entry-level .Net developer who learned mostly all I have on my own, and from my programmer brother who informally tutored me. So I have some know-how, but am not there yet. Considering how important JavaScript is to know for a .Net guy, I was glad to find your course and started the first iteration of it (that was just replaced with this new format). I was about 2 weeks in. Any advice on where I should go in this new format? Thanks!
I suspect there are quite a few who are in the same position as you. I will add a section to the roadmap about this tonight.
I am also about two weeks in. I had been going back and reading the first chapters of The Definitive Guide anyways. So I plan to keep with that (which sort of jives with the new roadmap). In addition, I was going to finish up the codecademy from the first two weeks of the original roadmap then do step 4, 5, and 6 for weeks 3 and 4 on the new roadmap. That should get me to the project point. I will probably start the project now anyways, even before I get to the jQuery part of the roadmap….just to start noodling around with something of my own.
Sounds good, Jeff. Since you have the “JavaScript: The Definitive Guide” book, it is easy to transition indeed, and this new track a lot easier and more effective. The old one had too many unimportant chapters from the other tougher book.
I was just about to add some notes for you, but then I remember the old track had the “JavaScript: The Definitive Guide” book, too, so it is very easy to transition to this new track. This new track is actually a lot easier (and more effective, I imagine) than the old one.
In Week 1 and 2 of this course steps 4, 6 and 8 are conflicting unless you mean to redo the track over and over? Would you be able to clarify this please? Or are they referring to a different track?
Thanks much for pointing that out, John O. I had forgotten to delete a bullet point. I just fixed it.
Glad I could help. This blog is doing wonders for me and my Final Year Project in college. Thanks for that.
Hey Richard, I was in the middle of learning javascript from your old post reading Nicholas Zakas Professional Javasscript etc… I think it has tremendously helped me… Now should I keep reading that and still go along with this new revise post… ????? thanks
Quick Update – Even tho Nicholas Zackas is a bit confusing at times, he does break down each concept that i do understand… I actually purchased the book, so re reading this post assumes I will have to buy The Defenitive Guide Book and start from scratch????? thanks
The last year I restart to learn JavaScript and I found Object-Oriented JavaScript very useful. For me, it’s more easy to understand some concepts like variables scope with that book that with “JavaScript: The Definitive Guide”.
I promptly added back the Professional JS for Web Developers book yesterday, after many readers requested it. So you can use **either** book now. Ever time I referenced one of the books I referenced the other.
@Ben S, @Sean, @jesus miguel, @Anthony, and others who have purchased the “Professional JavaScript for Web Developers” book or otherwise stared the old track, I just updated the post with complete coverage for the Professional JavaScript book. This updated roadmap is more streamlined and better than the old one.
I noted which chapters of this book you should read in each section. Now you can follow the entire course with either book.
“Professional JavaScript” is still my preference, but it is best read if you have at least a bit of web dev experience, while the other book is better for first-time programmers.
I would like to thank you for all your hard work, this site is a great resource. The backbone, JavaScript tutorials look great as well as all the other material on this site.
Nice to you to update the roadmap with “Professional JavaScript for Web Developers” I think that people who started to learn JS some time ago and is now, as me, trying to learn in the proper way could find this very useful.
I just started this about a week ago, i’m already on week two and now its all changed T_T, now i’m just confused
First, I apologize for the change that was indeed disruptive for some readers, for a day. But I promptly added back the Professional JS for Web Developers book yesterday, after many readers requested it. So you can use either book now. Ever time I referenced one of the books I reference the other.
In addition, you can follow this new roadmap with a seamless transition from the old one (no disruption). The new roadmap is much better than the previous one, because the previous one had too much unnecessary technical reading and a few other shortcomings, which I fixed and improved in this new track.
Thanks for the quick reply. I appreciate the effort in bringing back the Professional JS for Web Developers book.
After I first saw the update, some of the steps that I had already been working on got removed and I was a little confused as to whether I should continue on with the old course or transition to the new course.
I guess it was just a bit of a shock : ]. I’ve taken the time to re-examine the new course and I’ve figured out how I can transition from the old to the new.
The new refined course actually does look a lot better, and more strait-forward. Thanks for keeping this up to date, and thanks for this great course!
First, if you follow the Learn JS Properly course, you will see that you will learn jQuery at the same time as you are learning JS.
1. I recommend you learn JS properly (it includes jQuery), then read the “Effective JavaScript” book (it is one of the books I recommend in the Advanced JS roadmap). And it is easy to read: it is comprised of 68 excellent JS tips.
3. Now, it is very tricky to recommend a JS framework, because there are so many good ones to choose from and they are as similar as they are different. For now, I would say learn Backbone.js, because it is relatively easy to use, it is lightweight (not a big behemoth), there are many Backbone.js resources, and it is the most popular. No need to learn knockout.js plus backbone.js.
4. Then learn Node.js, and you are good to go. You can skip the rest, they are not necessary; most are alternatives to what you would have learned already.
Hey Richard, I have trouble learning client side javascript. There are so many things you need to memorize and its really difficult to do so. Do you have any tips that can help me enhance my knowledge on this specific topic. Thanks
Aarsh, you don’t have to memorize all the technical stuff. As long as you know how to use the concepts and you can program, you can Google or keep a JS book next to your computer. The best programmers don’t waste time memorizing the endless stream of technical details.
Learn JS properly, then learn Backbone.js, then you are good to go. Give yourself 6 – 8 weeks, and stick to it. Don’t quit.
First, my thanks for this guide to thorough learning of Javascript. It looks very well thought out, and the fact that you’re revising and improving it as the materials you refer to change and users give their comments means it will be valuable to many people for a long time to come.
My knowledge of Javascript and other web languages is very limited (at present), so I have one question: If I want to get content from a server-side MySQL database, then it seems to me that I can’t use client-side Javascript. Is that correct? and if so, is there a way round this, or do I have to use something like PHP for the parts of a web page that depend on database access?
Otherwise, learn Node.js, it is very easy to learn; you only have to learn some of the Node.js API, to get started.
Thanks, that clears it up for me. I know just a little PHP, but I’d rather get Javascript thoroughly under my belt and use that.
@Vic, JavaScript is used to talk to MySQL databases, the technique is called AJAX and is standard practice now a days.
There are many ways to do this, you can do it all in PHP or you can do it with JavaScript ( writing to the page )
I am excited about just starting out on this course track, though I have yet to purchase the books. I however have had a chance to peruse the opening chapters of both of them. Although I do not have a web development background, I must admit I like the presentation and the style of Zakas slightly more than that of the Definitive Guide from what I’ve initially seen. Would the difference between the two have an significant effect later on in if I went with Professional JS despite my background? Many thanks.
Use Zakas’s book if you like it and understand it. It is better and it covers up to advanced topics, so in the long run, it is a better book.
I was wondering if javascript object orientated is easy to learn and use in the real web applications? Do you use object orientation in your web apps? Thanks…
Yes, Object-Oriented JavaScript is considerably easier than in many languages. And it is definitely used extensively to develop JavaScript web applications.
As a sort of a thank you gift, I would like to share a tutorial on how to integrate WebStorm, SmartGit, and bitbucket to check all exercise files into a Git repo (in this example, bitbucket.org).
You should created a tutorial for getting started with WebStorm. I imagine many users will need such a tutorial, which I had planned to write but I simple don’t have the time to do it.
BTW, I like the image of the tropics that you have on your website. It makes me want to take a vacation.
Many thanks for these awesome guidelines. I really want to learn Javascript, although I am a beginner. I have only HTML and CSS knowledge and I guess Javascript will be helpful in the future.
A couple of weeks ago I found out about Codecademy, I did a few tasks on Javascript but what can I say, I didn’t like their process of learning.
I am in my early 20s and as you said, sometimes frustration may be present. However, I am really eager to learn this and if you have the right resources you can do it easily, in my opinion.
Hopefully in 2-3 months I will be able to create my own stuff and have a good knowledge of Javascript. I also took Javascript The Definitive Guide, as you recommended for beginners.
Can you tell us more of what WebStorm offers that makes it better that ST2? I have been using the trail but I am not sure what features to look for and there is a slight learning curve, considering I am so used to ST2 and my work flow is so integrated with ST2.
I really should write a blog post comparing the two, because this requires a thorough review. Nonetheless, if you are already very comfortable with Sublime Text 2, you should keep using it for now.
Later, when you are ready to develop complex JavaScript web applications, you will have outgrown Sublime Text 2 and that would be a good time to look into WebStorm.
Indeed, there is a moderate learning curve for WebStorm, but it is similar to using Sublime Text 2, except it has many more specific JavaScript features and integration with JavaScript libraries and frameworks, including Node.js, CoffeeScript, jQuery, and a lot more.
It would really help if you made an article about WebStorm. I need someone to tell me about features, so I have a solid reason to pay for it. Maybe include in article some extra links about using the program.
But I find it tedious to study over trivial parts, such as chapter 4, I mean do I really need to read beforehand how “+” operator works, isn’t that obvious how it works?
Thank you so much for this tutorial on learning JS. As a designer, I found myself using jQuery widgets a lot on webpages, but I always wanted to learn JS properly.
Now I am on week 3-4 and starting to grasp Objects, but I have run into a problem regarding the ‘hacking’ away part of the lesson: Most everything that I think of doing to practice with JS has already been solved by either jQuery UI or CSS3, and I can’t really think of any good exercises that I could experiment with to further develop my skills. Do you have a resource that could give me some practical problems so that I can practice solving them? I’m not looking for a Codeacademy-type hand holding, but left to my own devices, I can’t think of any good problems that I can solve at this level of skill.
I think you should build the quiz application I noted in the post above. It will help you develop a complete JavaScript web application that starts off simple and gets increasingly more advanced. See the details in the post above.
BTW, I am sorry about the late reply to your post. I don’t know how I missed your comment. I have only now stumbled upon it.
I am working through this track slowly but surely. Things are starting to fall into place. I am also building my first web app with Meteor as I go (I need to apply while I learn, if I just read, I will not grasp anything and will probably fall asleep). So I am learning JS, JS programming and the Meteor framework at the same time. I will get there, I will get there, I will get there.
Meteor.js is great. I plan to use it to develop my next two projects. I highly recommend it, even though it is still in its infancy.
Is this a typo in the section for weeks 3 & 4? Where is the “Prototype Pattern” material located? Thanks.
can read up to “Prototype Pattern.” The other object patterns are quite dense for you at this juncture and they are not necessary for you to know now.
i just wanted to say thank you, before reading your blog post i didnt have a road map to follow in order to learn javascript, i also got stuckevery time on codeacademy javascript challenges, by now its been almost a month since i started reading the books and following the roadmap…..im so exited because today with the knowladge in javascript and using jquery i made the challenge of make my own dynamic quiz application and it feels so good to know im improving!!!!!!…im so looking forward to keep improving and improve the quiz as it follows!!!!!
Congrats, Jhonnatan. I am very happy to hear about your progress, and I am sure many others will be inspired by your determination.
Thank you for the great tutorial guide, so helpful for beginner like me who don’t know where to start learning Javascript. I got the book, now I’m ready to learn properly
Thanks for the brilliant post. I’d just like to ask you one thing before I dive headfirst into this. Could you consider another link than Amazon? O’Reilly might be a good alternative or at least an option. They’re a very progressive publisher leading a lot of modern trends. Plus they’re in support of a more open web not limiting their eBook downloads to a proprietary format. Of course if you’re going to do all the work to write this I wouldn’t mind supporting you.
Hi, I was just wondering if this is still relevant or not. I’m always concerned about stuff being outdated. Also, I’ve programmed in C and some Java. Should I go with “Javascript for Web Developers”?
This blog post is very new; it was originally written about 5 months and it was updated just 2 months ago.
You can definitely get a great job once you have learned JavaScript properly (including jQuery) and then learn Backbone.js. Front-end developers are in great demand right now.
Very thorough and wonderful resource. I’ve been sharing this link. Thanks for taking the time to do this!
Richard, I’m using the Professional JavaScript for Web Developers guide. In week 4, you ask us to read chapter 19 of JavaScript: The Definitive Guide for the JQuery chapter. Is there another resource that covers this or do we need to purchase a second book?
Very food question, Linda. I just updated the roadmap. Instead of learning jQuery on Codecademy or in the JS the Definitive Guide book (as I had originally recommended), I now recommend this link:
thank you for doing this, it is very helpful for beginners like me, I have a question. I want to learn javascript but also C #, which language is better to start, thanks again
Hi Richard, congrats for your excellent work. I am currently on week 4 and I am a little confused about the “Javascript or jQuery” subject and can’t figure out the right answer.
Should someone has a very solid understanding of JS and only then move to jQuery, or he has to learn both parallel?
I really want to hear your opinion because you have real experience. My aim isn’t just to start coding and see quick results. I ‘d like to be able to use HTML/CSS/JS for a lot of uses, even for mobile apps for example. Not just some webpage effects etc…
In hindsight, I think I should recommend jQuery (for DOM manipulation) for the first go at the quiz (and not pure JS), because everyone will be using jQuery afterwards anyway.
However, if anyone wants to use pure JS, go for it; you will learn how to manipulate the DOM with JS, which is important to know as a JS developer, in case you ever have to do it without jQuery. And you will also understand how jQuery actually works. But it is not necessary to use pure JS for the DOM manipulation, if you can do it much easier and quicker with jQuery.
Hello, I am beginner, I am learning with “Professional Javascript for Web Developers” book but I was wondering if real life developers(front-end) use everything covered in the steps often or necessary to know them? or some topics are rarely used?
No. No one uses everything from a programming book in real life, just like no one uses most of what he learns in school in real life. In the roadmap above, I recommended you skip many parts of the book. See the roadmap for more.
Derek Sivers is the first to complete the quiz and post his code, you can checkout his code and learn from his efforts. Here is his code in pure JS:
I am very aprecieted about all of you articles. It is like a good book, with growing level of complexity, very motivaiting and well structured.
Right? I love the author for writing this. It’s so hard to find a path on how to learn tech it’s not funny(frustrating?).
allQuestions[0] or making acessing the property of that object/array such as allQuestions.question..
Im guessin it would be a bit easier if i created three seperated objects or arrays such as below.. thanxx
Never mind I figured it out :), to access a object inside an array as the Quiz stated, one would need to do the following:
what was confusing me , as well as getting errors, was the second choice array inside of this array.. i just took that second array out (choices) and i figured it out.. Richard was that a good idea to take that second array out?? thanks
@Sean, I am glad to hear about your progress and your struggles Welcome to the life of a programmer.
And the coolest part is that he will keep updating his code as he learn jQuery and other technologies. So keep an eye on the link.
I love the link to Derek Sivers quiz code. I just pushed another revision to my own quiz app so I am at a point where I am looking forward to sitting down and looking over his code to see how someone else approached the application.
Way to go, Josh. Excellent, Mate. I like that you went for an OOP quiz. I will link to both yours and Derek’s in the article above in a few days. Heck, I will tweet about your effort right now
If you aren’t already, you should join the Reddit study group at the link below (or at least drop by and show them your quiz):
I just finished the 1st version of my quiz in pure JS and wanna share with you guys! Here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/zryHu/ . I think that I have written some parts not with the best way, but the main purpose was to get it work!
Very Cool, Antonio. Excellent job. Keep adding on to it, and very soon you will be developing full-scale JS applications.
I have to say that I am -incredibly- grateful for this post. I started a few weeks ago and I’m already feeling great after completing the first iteration of the quiz project, and I’m continually motivated to learn more and learn about JavaScript every single day. In just the last few weeks, I went from knowing next to nothing to actually building things and even learning CoffeeScript in the process. Thank you for the great post and helpful information!
You should probably show the question number (1 of 10), so the user has an idea which question he is on and how many more questions to come.
Thanks for the feedback. I’ve added some comments to make it easier to understand what’s happening and uploaded the new js file.
Hey whats up Richard, I finished my Justin Timberlake Quiz. Its Pure JS, it still needs some work, hopefully you’ll check it out.. http://seanshoats.com/jtquiz.html
Hopefully my quiz can be some help to some guys who are stuck like I was lol….. thanks so much for this blog!!! Richard You Rock!!
Congrats, Bro. I am really inspired by you guys. Keep up the good work and keep making your quiz more advance as you learn more advance topics.
Thank you taking the time to provide guidance and clear direction. I have tried many times to become proficient in javascript. I am fortunate to now have a mentor. I stumbled upon your site looking for information on backbone.js
In my area NYC surrounding the income compensation is worth the effort. Thank you for providing a clear path to achievement
I know this might be outside the focus of this website, but since it still is related to web development I would appreciate an article about “how to learn php properly”, especially since a lot of programmers learn it the wrong way.
Good job on the course so far. I just wanted to point out a little ‘bug’. I think that the link for web-storm description has changed from http://2oahu.com/blog/webstorm-javascript/ (doesn’t work) to http://2oahu.com/posts/2013/webstorm-javascript/. It’ s not that hard to find the correct one, but would be nice if you changed it here as well.
The ‘bug’ is actually my fault, not R. Bovell. When R. Bovell first wrote about my 2oahu.com blog, I was using WordPress and I kept everything under blog/. However I recently decided to ditch WordPress and went for Pelican and in the process switched around the urls. I did include html forwards in the new site for more popular pages but my deployment script for deploying the html files didn’t know about the html forwards.
I’m trying to work through the tutorial and made it already to week 5-6. But I’m having a bit problems implementing the changes.
Questions: Is there any possibility for code review? e.g. somebody looking through the code and suggesting how to do things “better”. Also, do you have any suggestions for keeping a better structure? I’m trying to stuff things into functions to keep somewhat the different effects seperated, but is there any recommended way of doing this?
Thanks for your questions, Peter, and sorry about the late reply. There is a study group on Twitter that would be very happy to help you out with the code by reviewing your code and answering all of your questions.
The group members, especially the organizer, are very helpful and they have been helping out each for weeks now. Here is the link:
Its such as you read my mind! You appear to grasp so much about this, like you wrote the guide in it or something.
I feel that you just can do with a few % to force the message home a bit, but other than that, this is excellent blog.
I was wondering– what’s the difference between Ruby Mine and Webstorm? They are both by jetbrains but Ruby Mine seems to include a few more features than Webstorm.
Hey Richard, I was wondering on my journey to learning javascript, should I also learn php/msql to create data driven as well as CMS web apps? Where a user has complete control in the backend (admin settings etc)…Or Should I learn node.js for this, I thought node.js is mainly for server side driven apps
This is an interesting question, Sean. If you want to know (and you should) how to develop general websites, customize CMS and blogs, and the like, it makes sense to learn PHP/MySQL. Many huge web apps are built with PHP, so it is worth knowing. But you should still Node.js or at least Meteor.js.
Thank you so much for this helpful post. I’m just wondering how many hours per week you had in mind in your estimate?
Just to note i all of rhe html tags are empty the only one who as value and attributes is the next button.
And my simple thinking was for every qistion in allqustion object.is to show the first qusetion (position 0) and append it to h1 using jQuery.
Next for every choice append chicice ( start with position 0) to li num1 after that go to the next li abd append the next choice. Untilthere are no li tags to fill.
Now when the client click next i check the value of the radio if its not undfinded meaning it is not empty procced to next qustion by earsing the current h1 value and doing the same as i explained above for qusetion position 1.
If the value of the choosen radio button is equals to the qusetion answer. Then correcAnswer get +1 to it.
Yes, as a web developer, you have to learn HTML5 and CSS3 for sure. Fortunately, those are the easiest technologies you will ever learn as a web developer.
Thanks for this informative post. I followed along with the reddit group and found it to be helpful to have a group to study along with.
Someone told me to write about the process to better understand what I am learning. So my blog follows each week of your program, maybe it will help other people going through the program.
More importantly, I would like to share the two live dynamic quizzes I have created. The first one in pure JS that I did and the second which utilizes jQuery: http://www.briandavishall.com/projects/
Lastly, I would greatly appreciate anyone who would critique my code. What would you do differently and why? As a noob coder, I figure this is a critical step in learning.
Thanks for your comment and for posting your code. I am sure both will help other JS developers who are also learning JS.
I took a cursory look at your code and it looks good. As you look at others code later on in your dev career, you will learn a lot about how adv. developers code, but for now, keep learning and coding. As long as your projects are working as expected, you are doing fine.
When you learn JS frameworks like Backbone.js, you will see how they better organized your code and make your entire code look very professional
So it looks like you have overcame the trouble you were having and you completed your quiz. Good job.
Hi Owl, I really like your quiz, Mate. It is slick and smooth, and the timer makes it exciting and nerve wrecking
Do you have this code for viewing on Github? I really like what you did with this quiz and want to see how you did it.
After completing the Javascript track at Codeacademy and realizing that, while I learned quite a bit, I still have no idea how to implement JS, I found your course, “How to Learn JavaScript Properly” using Javascript: The Definitive Guide (I have the other recommended book as well, but I figured I’d work through once with the beginner book and once with the more advanced). I am having some difficulty in determining how to enter the code and try it out using Firebug. Nothing that I can find seems to allow me to enter the code form the book, run it, and see how it works. I have tried looking up tutorials for firebug, but to no avail. Can you explain how to go about entering the code and testing it? Also, is it necessary to enter everything, beginning with chapter 1.1 core JavaScript?
— On Chrome, at the very top of the window on your monitor: Select View > Developer > JavaScript Console.
— On Firefox, at the very top of the window on your monitor: Select Tools > Web Developer > Web Console.
You don’t really need Firebug at all. Firebug allows you to view the HTML elements (the DOM) on the page and use the console for JavaScript and such, but Firefox has added all this functionality within the browser itself without the need to install Firebug plugin, so you don’t need Firebug anymore like you did a few years ago.
Ok. Thanks much. Last question (for now): Should I enter all code from the book, beginning with the first introduction to variables in section 1.1? If not where should I start?
I’m stuck at this part. It seems most people use jquery .getJSON but when I try this it appears the rest of my script runs before getJSON callback completes.
Also, if you read some of the comments above, you will find links to the source code of other beginners’ completed quizzes. Take a look and see how some of them have solve the problem you are having.
I looked through the other quiz before posting. Most of them moved the quiz data into a second JavaScript file, then imported it using a second script tag in the HTML.
Where the external data is really just another JavaScript file. This works but it is not much different than before.
I was expecting to import the JSON as objects (not a variable or function) and from within my JavaScriprt.. Not from additional HTML script tags.
I tried to load the data using .getJSON, but it loaded it asynchronously after the rest of my JavaScript had finished running.
I changed it to $.ajax and disabled async and this did the trick (until I can re-write my quiz in async style).
This works, and I’ve learned more about working with JSON data, but I’m still not sure how to do this if we didn’t use jQuery, or if there is an easier way.
It was very resourceful of you to look for a solution that could work for you specific case, and this is standard practice in the life of a programmer. So you did the right thing.
AJAX without jQuery is a bit tedious, and quite frankly, I don’t think I have ever seen anyone in last few years use AJAX without jQuery, except for demonstration purposes or to teach pure JS AJAX.
You can put your quiz inside a function (at least the part of the quiz to start the quiz), let’s say an init() function which will get the quiz started.
I had similar problems with loading json file. I was first trying with getJSON() method but it didn’t work. So I tried $.ajax() today and managed to make it work with async: true.
My quiz is in an object variable creatively named ‘quiz’ and this is the method for loading the questions, when its done it assings retrieved data to the allQuestions property of the quiz object and calls setPlayerName() method that prompts user for a name and starts the quiz.
Here is the quiz app, in its current state, questions are really just fooling around, I was more concerned about functionality so far.
well those two books lack explanation on JSON, i didnt saw any reminder for the getJSON at those two books,
In the “Professional JavaScript for Web Developers” book, chapter 20 (JSON) is a very short chapter and it covers EVERYTHING you need to know about JSON to develop JavaScript web applications.
JSON is a data structure that is used to transfer data to and from the server and to save data in an external source, such as a file or in localStorage in the browser. On the other hand, AJAX is a method for communicating with the server asynchronously.
You can use JSON as the data format to transfer data while communicating with the server via an AJAX call. So you are correct that JSON and AJAX do go “hand in hand.” But you don’t have to know AJAX to use JSON, although you will eventually have to know both technologies to develop production-ready JavaScript web apps.
I have created my first jQuery plugin that allows users to create an image slider that is populated via content from Instagram. It supports both a hashtag search and a @username feed.
I just checked out your code, and I have to say I am impressed. Very good work, Mate. But the demo on your site doesn’t appear to be working. I am using Chrome.
I know, the demo is hosted on my blog and good old godaddy has just gone down yesterday. It should be fixed over the weekend.
Sweet little quiz there, Boaz. I didn’t understand the PJ question. But as a soccer fan, I love the Messi question.
and now iv just finsihed reading your post on the final part of your post: OOP In JavaScript: What You NEED to Know.
and i think i got it…the only thing i didnt understood is, why creating objects (from constructor function), and creating a child objects…
beacuse i thought we need to save our questions in an external JSON file, and of course we cant make functions and so on in JSON.
Doing those advanced projects will definitely help. But be sure to follow and read these 16 JS concepts:
Thank you very much for you work in putting together this tutorial. I know that it wasn’t trivial and it’s been very helpful in my studies.
Also, if you are open to feedback, I think it would really help people to do the free Chrome DevTools course before starting. As a newbie, I didn’t understand your many references to the console and to writing code in the browser until I did that tutorial.
Lastly, I think people should do the jQuery course before trying to finish the basic project (at least one required jQuery and I couldn’t do it). Perhaps the jQuery course should also come before reading about the DOM in the JS for Professionals book because I found the book to abstract until I had a visual of what the DOM was and how it could be manipulated.
I also know that learning jQuery before building the quiz makes it much easier to develop the quiz, but the goal is to know pure JavaScript enough that you can use it to build a an app like the quiz. It is not essential or important that one use only JS, especially since most developers will use jQuery in their careers anyway. But the challenge of using JS will force you to learn JS well. And by the time you get to jQuery, jQuery will be a walk in the park.
Well, I personally don’t have much experience with PhoneGap. Is there a reason you need PhoneGap in particular?
No, I want to develop apps for mobile and tablet devices. PhoneGap is cross-platform and easy to use, so I chose it.
I have heard good things about PhoneGap, but I haven’t used it. It is indeed one of the best bet for mobile JS web apps, based on what I have read.
Besides PhoneGap, other technologies such as jQuery Mobile and even frameworks like Backbone.js (used along with responsive HTML/CSS frameworks like Bootstrap 3) are worthwhile technologies for mobile JS development.
Thanks for taking time to write such a brilliantly structured article on the JavaScript roadmap. Really appreciate your efforts!. Helped me a lot.
The only tough part is persisting the data (users who take the quiz along with their scores). The best way to do this is to use a database, in which case you will need to use MySQL or a NoSQL database like MongoDB (I recommend MongoDB).
1. Before a user takes the quiz, present the user with a simple text field asking for his name or email. Then when the user completes the quiz, save his name/email along with his score to the database.
2. And when you show the user his score, upon completion of the quiz, also show him the average score of other users—you can get this by fetching all the scores from the database and calculating the average. You can also show the highest and the lowest scores, so the user has an idea how his score compares with the best and worst scores. Again, you can get this data from the database.
I will put together a MongoDB tutorial, but I don’t think I will complete it soon. I will likely add it to the book I am writing. But you can find some good MongoDB tutorials online, although I haven’t find any that was thorough enough. They were good enough to get started though.
Hi Mr. Bovel. Do you have any suggestion(book or roadmap) for CSS, please? I am at week 4, and I have made the quiz and it works properly, but it isn’t look so good(because of lack of appearance).
I am sure there are some excellent CSS-only books out there, but I would recommend the following book because you will learn CSS3, HTML5, and Responsive Design in one go (You have to learn all 3 eventually, so you might as well do them together):
I’m just not entirely sure which book I should get. When you say “at least a bit of programming or web development experience,” well I’ve taken and passed a couple of intro to programming classes on plain old Java and Pascal before that, and I can make a very basic web-page in HTML and alter CSS (though I’ve never written it myself). Does that qualify as at least a bit? I’m just not sure if that’s enough that I should get the not-a-complete-beginner book.
You are definitely qualify as having some web dev experience, so get the Professional JS book. You will be fine because I actually explain nearly ALL the important JavaScript concepts on my blog, so you can always just read some of the blog posts, if there are some concepts that you don’t follow in the book.
Thanks a lot for posting your Angular.js quiz. It is very interesting to see your quiz and compare it with the others—considerably less code to begin with.
I would encourage other JS newbie developers to look at your code and go learn a bit of Angular.js to get a feel for what it is like to develop with a popular JS framework.
Really a wonderful post.. Though I am a web developer and using javascript in my projects, I haven’t learnt javascript using any books. After reading your blog I think it’s time to get a book and learn javascript progressively and completely. I’m going to start suggested learning plan.. thanks a lot:)
Hopefully in 2 months I’m gonna be on the right track to take a step forward with my front end career.
Hey Grzegorz!….. if you are looking for a succes story i can tell you that i was in my way to learn javascript to be a Front End Devoloper. 9 months ago I finished my studies as an artist in the university and i decided to start programming because i love the web, i took the roadmap in this Blog and almost 5 months ago i found job as frond en developer in this digital agency http://www.enigmind.com . I didnt sent and and email to Richard but a post a comment beeing so greertfully because of this great path to learn Javascript. Right now im not the greatets Front End developer, i still have too much to learn but if it wasnt for this path i will be probbably still looking for a job. Sorry for my bad english but this is not my main lenguage. Cheers.
If you read many of the comments above, you will see that many readers have been learning JS and developing the quiz application and improving their web-dev skills along the way. And I imagine they will eventually be world-class JS developers
Well, the idea is to type out all the example code that you will run or test, so that you get to properly understand each line.
But if you are not running the code or there is huge block of code that you think typing out will not help you, no need to type it out.
FWIW – I type out everything and I’ve learned what I need to be careful of when typing – what I’m likely to make a typo with. I think typing it all out, while tiresome, will help it stick in your brain. At least, that’s what I hope will happen.
Thanks so much for this! What a great resource! I was struggling figuring out how to teach myself so having something to follow makes it much easier.
In addition to CodeCademy, I am using Code Avengers. I think it’s a better resource with CodeCademy in that a) it makes you do more of the work and b) it has better help resources if you get stuck.
I am also using JSBin to test my code because I like that you can turn off the sections you don’t need at the moment which gives more space to see your code on a smaller screen. It also gives you tips if there is something wrong with your code.
You are welcome, Mandy. Keep the hard work and don’t give up You will be very happy when you accomplished your goal.
great stuff!! can’t wait for your article on meteor.js. in the meantime, i suppose i’ll have to purchase tom coleman’s discovering meteor.
I will definitely write about Meteor.js, but I prefer to do so after I complete the huge Meteor.js project I am developing right now.
Yes, I agree that getting the Discover Meteor book is the best bet at this point, since there is really no other book on Meteor.js.
Yup I’ve learned javascript/ still learning advanced javascript thanks to Richard, and im now learning mysql/php along with it and I can tell you ajax works flawlessly with mysql db..
I’ve been working my way through this although a little bit more slowly than recommended. However when I started chapter 14 of Professional Javascript for Web Developers I found the code not working and it felt like I was missing something vital.
After skimming the two skipped chapters I found that Chapter 13 has you create an object called EventUtil that’s used pretty heavily in chapter 14. Might be beneficial to have people read the beginning bit of 13 before moving to 14
Hahaha. No problem at all, Brett. I am glad to hear you are coding a lot. Thanks for the tip about chapter 14 and 13.
I ended up going through 12 and 13 and not skipping either of them to get back on track. I think you could probably get away with skipping 12 though as the two extra chapters add quite a lot of time(I think there were over 100 pages or so between them.)
Feel free to reach out to me on skype or twitter(brett_warner on both) if you need a study partner to bounce ideas off of. My pace is slightly slower that ideal though on this course.
hi Richard am interested in learning java script but I got no programming experience any suggestion, by the way thanks this site is so useful in helping make my mind up
You don’t really need any programming experience to learn JavaScript. It is a great language to start with. Join one of the study groups and get started as soon as you can.
is in the javascript roadmap we will be also learn dealing with cross browser compatibility and cross security issues ?
Is there any particular reason you’ve skipped chapter 13: events, in professional Js for web developers?
Apologies, just thought it was easier to digest before going into chapter 14. Nonetheless your roadmap has been a big help! I Thank you
Been looking for a proper guideline like these among the sea of resources about javascript for some time…thank you a lot Richard for all your efforts.. I promise to be a top class javascript developer one day, thanks again Sir..
Congratulations, Wanwu. Very good work there on the quiz. Now, keep learning and keep coding and go build amazing stuff!
Hi Richard, i’m on the course, and I learned to “like” the Flanagan book which I first found totally unsuitable to learning because of being quite complicated. Fact is, this book is thorough and can’t see how to master the language without this book. Examples are often unnecessarily inexpressive and complicated though.
IF I learn jquery, is it necessary to go trough the dom-bom manipulation chapters of the Flanagan book about standard JS manipulations ?
I had a long question on it but I can’t seem to post it here – am getting a ‘firewall blocked’ message?
… Some more from my probably too long question/comment! [ I guess that’s why I can’t get it to post ]:
– I’ve read that for cross-browser compatibility, and simplicity, the jQuery DOM API makes a lot of sense over vanilla Javascript unless you are a highly proficent in Javascript.
– I realise that there is a performance hit – download times as well as memory usage and performance for using any library, including jQuery
– Still, I don’t think my vanilla Javscript skills would be able to compete with jQuery at this time!
– How about backbone, angular and node.js – given I want to gain these skills would I really struggle if I didn’t go into the advanced Javascript stuff?
Indeed, jQuery makes it easy for the front-end developer to traverse the DOM and develop sites that are compatible with all browsers. You are correct, so using jQuery is recommended for production applications.
Note that jQuery is actually built with Vanilla JavaScript, so everything that you can do with jQuery, you can do with Vanilla JavaScript, but it is just a lot more work.
As a front-end developer, you will likely use a ton of jQuery in your career, so it makes sense to definitely learn jQuery thoroughly. Whichever source you find to be the best for learning jQuery, use that.
Now, even though you may know jQuery very well, it will still be useful (though not necessary) for you to read the DOM and BOM chapters. So, read the DOM and BOM chapters, if you can, to get a fundamental understanding of the stuff works and then learn jQuery.
As for Angular.js, I will be writing about this and all the other JS frameworks on moderndevelopertoolkit.com. For now, you still want to know jQuery, which is probably the easiest thing to learn with the most utility in all of web development.
I would rather recommend Ruby on Rails as a prototyping language, if you’re the startup guy or entreprenuer, trying to learn how to code, on the internet.
Hello, first of all I am so glad I stumbled upon this outline. Very helpful because most of the time I felt lost trying to learn javascript before. So now I have a question for you. I am trying to get a internship as a Front-end Developer and was curious to how you measure completion of this course with being qualified skill wise for an internship? I already know HTML5 and CSS3 fairly well and I am currently half way done with this course and I must say I am feeling already more confident in my javascript knowledge. But I was curious to what your insight was? Btw, thanks for this outline.
1. First, I don’t think you need to complete this entire course to get an internship. With an adequate enough of familiarity of HTML5 and CSS3, you should be fine.
2. I think if you complete this course and you practice afterwards by building a few applications, you will improve you readiness for a front-end job markedly. You should learn jQuery completely and, if you have sufficient time, learn Backbone.js, too.
So you should complete this course whether you get the internship position or not, and start building some small applications afterwards. This alone will allow you to learn an essential skill and make you marketable as a JS developer.
well, i want to learn javascript. want to learn the programming. but, what software? i mean, i can copy the code yes , but to where? and how do i know it is correct?
i am mac user… and now i want free software as i just want to try and learn, nothing about profession yet. any suggestion? i am kinda lost in the java world ….
2. To create your code and save them, you can use any editor like Sublime Text (which is great, and you can get it free) or Smultron (which is also free). And then you can open the .js (to HTML with embedded JavaScript) )file in the browser to test the code.
3. You can also test the code right in the browser’s console. You can Google for screenshots on how to do this.
Here is my first try at doing anything in JavaScript – really enjoying it so far. Not very good at the moment but I’m going to keep at it: http://jsfiddle.net/greenhulk01/LY36A/33/embedded/result/
hi Richard,am Stanley and am 18 years.i just want to say thank you very much for this course,its is really helping me.but i have a couple of questions which are troubling me very much and they are disrupting my progress.
(1)am just finishing chapter 9(professional javascript book) but i have trouble understanding regular expressions used in this chapter,honestly speaking the book didn’t cover much about regex.So,should i worry about them?(because i have a regular expressions cookbook but it has too many pages and i feel like it will slow me down on your course).
useragent detection script or all the code i have encountered in the book.this is has been my biggest problem,thats ‘why i didnt include it on number.most people dont answer me clearly.
(4)is it normal for me to just read code but fail to write.because right now i just cant write any real program like sliding images or making a date.(if its normal ,then after reading which chapter should i attempt this to do this things(mind you,am on chapter 9[zachas book]).
(5)when do you know you fluent in javascript and ready to move on to a server sided language(i know about node,js but i have always wanted to learn php or ruby)?
(6) someone asked how many hours you had in mind for this course and you said 2 hours but the thing is i stay home all day.so the question is,should i stick to 2 hours? and if not,how long should i take to finish this?i fail to give myself a deadline.can you give me one since i stay all day.i learn better with deadline and am a recovering procrastinator.so i need to fix my productivity.
(7)lastly,how long has your website been around.i cant help but notice how its ranking well on google.if its knew,did do you do a lot of seo or it just went on top.am asking this because when i finally learn this,i want to enter a tutorial and a learning web design niche .is it possible to make it top ten?
am so sorry for all this question,i just have never had satisfactory answers.please try to answer and i know your busy.thanks again for this sexy post and am telling you posts are always sexy.you are heaven sent for javascript learners.
Hi there! Thanks for posting this awesome guideline. I’ve been following it for a few weeks and I thought i’ll recommend a wonderful resource to practice programming in JavaScript.
codewars.com gives you step by step community build challenges to hone you JavaScript skills in particular areas, be it Algorithm design or basic fundamentals.
I just tried the first question on your homepage. It might be best to have the user enter a code-related answer, instead of an essay-type answer in the form of an sentence.
Actually you have to fix the code to make it work (like adding the semicolon) In the first example (most are randomly generated) you have to use the this keyword to reference the name variable in the parent function.
Hi Richard ! Thank you so much man , I really appreciate what are you doing for us , you’re really helpful , I was obsessed in learning Javascript 😀 😀 , I started learning it 2 times ago ! and I stumbled in both of them . And now I’m good with your Roadmap ! It’s awesome 😉 I have just completed the chapter 2 !
But I have a question (I don’t if you will reply it soon, but ..) about Codeacademy I think the track is changed !
Because you said in (week 4) : “Return to Codecademy and complete the JavaScript track by working through sections 6, 7, and 8 (Data Structures to Object 2).”
A other question : I didn’t understand the section of “Document Modes” in Chapter 2 ! Any other reference to get it ? !
You can ignore that discussion abut Document Mode completely. The author was sharing some background information about a compatibility mode for IE5.5 and older browser.
As a modern developer, you wouldn’t be needing the information discussed in “Document Mode” in chapter 2. It is practically useless to you. It was more relevant about 4-5 years ago.
I answered your other question before I saw your updated comment that it was a mistake on your end. No problem. I still have to update this post.
I have to spend some time updating some of the blog posts, especially this “How to Learn JS” one. I will try to do that in late December when I have a bit more time. I am too inundated to get to it sooner.
So I am going through this course of learning and, in accordance with your advice, I am writing out the code that I am coming across (in the Definitive Guide) into JSFiddle and … NOTHING ever happens ??? No results. Nada.
I have just finished chapter 3. And still … nothing. Am I to assume that this is normal? -Or am I totally missing the boat here? This is making my comprehension level drop significantly it seems since everything I’ve read is all just hypothetical stuff.
its normal Rookie.it happens to me each and every day.it has has to be a mistake in your code,maybe you forget to call the functions or you made some typos.simple things can break you code,yesterday when i was trying to make a javascript date,just one simple typo made it fail.just look clearly.Am pretty sure Richard has good solution..
I wish that you were correct Stanley. But I don’t think so … I am just typing out the very simple stuff as it appears in the first few chapters. It is not at all difficult to duplicate exactly.
I am wondering if I am somehow using JSFiddle incorrectly or something (?) since this is all new to me and I have no way to tell which end is up. (???)
Have you tried running the examples in a browser console rather than through JSFiddle? That might be a good way to narrow down whether it’s a code issue or a JDFiddle issue.
No, I have not. I do have the Firebug thing set up on my Firefox … but I really don’t know how to use it. I tend to get caught up in the minutiae (do I need to have an HTML file set up? -should I have an external JS? -or embed it in the HTML? etc. etc. etc.). Perhaps there is a simple “how to” type of tutorial out there about Firebug (?).
Most of my time so far has been going through the very beginnings of the codecedemy stuff and reading from both books.
Well,if thats the case,then try to download notepad++(the best free editor) and then make an html and js file and the link them.to create an html/js file,open new file and then then select language(its on the toolbar) and the in the js file,paste the following code:
if this doesnt work,go to chrome/firefox developers tool and then check the error and the line where the error occured.this should help find errors quickly.
If so, I don’t think that your advice would work for me as I am on a Mac and (I was under the impression) that notepad++ was for pc computers, etc.
This stuff is difficult enough as it is without trying to jump through all of these other hoops with outdated tools, etc. -Frustrating.
yes my reply was for you.sorry for the bad English,i wrote it when i was sleepy.good luck with learning javascript.
am sorry for my silly questions.recently i have just understood that the only way to learn programming is practice,practice,practice.i used to think that i had to memorize and know each and everything before i could start practice programming.i think it was because i was afraid i might fail.now i have learnt to face my fears because doing them makes a difference.That being said, i have started breaking and reversing other peoples code and seeing what works and doesnt,its cool to see how mistakes build you up.Currently,am now grasping the DOM,i hope in the few weeks i ,might be able to program some real cool applications from my brain and i cant wait to start the quiz project and practice * 1000.and i just found some interesting quotes,maybe it might motivate others who were/are in the same boat:
“Inaction breeds doubt and fear. Action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear, do not sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.”
Hi, i don’t know what to say but i have a long story with this blog and especially with this post I’ve read this post 6 months ago and i love it so much but i did’t bookmark it and it’s been a 3 week that i’am looking for this post and I’ve finally found it and this’s really one of the best and complete posts about Javascript thank you
Hi Richard , I have a little problem in understanding “Accessor Properties” ! the problem is : why I use underscore as a prefix of a variable ? !
” The underscore on _year is a common notation to indicate that a property is not intended to be accessed
Hey like the tut and trying to follow it but can’t say i am big fan of Professional JavaScript for Web Developers, it’s very dry and eager to give you a history lesson along and meaningless info at the time with unnecessary long way to explain something, sometimes ending up missing the point.
I find myself using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide on top of it with greater success.
Atlas, I understand what you mean: Some people don’t like to study from books like Professional JS for Web Developers, for the reasons you have mentioned.
I have written articles on some of the core topics covered in the book, so you can use those articles, if necessary. But since you have found a way to learn the language that works for you, stick with it.
But I’m confused (Scopes, Private values, private functions, function expressions, the function type ..) ! I found it more than a time WHY? !!! I just want to get it simply , resuming all what I need about that . I wish you understand my question, because I really need help
You can skip Chapter 7, if you are having trouble understanding it. The only lesson from Chapter 7 that is essential is the one on “Closures.” But I have written a full article on closures on this blog. So just skip Chapter 7 and read my article.
Awesome tutorial… really motivated me to go beyond simply doing tutorials, and actually start building applications.
Here is my Quiz app… I need to add better quiz content, but fairly happy with overall application logic and UX. I will continue to refine and improve as I learn more about JavaScript.
Thanks for starting the new study group on Reddit. I just tweeted the link. And I will add the link to this blog post in a couple minutes.
Richard of Stanley, besides the roadmap here, do you recommend any other resources like learnstreet, etc? What about eloquent javascript? Seems like the most popular choice for beginning javascript students.
Hi. I have a question regarding what book to buy. You stated that anyone with programming experience can get Professional JavaScript for Web Developers, I have programming experience in C/C++ and JAVA but no web development experience.
Hi! I just read the first 2 chapters of the Definitive Guide, and although I have some experience with HTML & CSS, even did some JS on Codecademy before I started the book, I DID NOT understand most of what the first chapters were talking about. I thought when it said the book is for people with no prior experience in Programming, that everything would be explained from scratch, but it doesn’t seem so. Should I not worry and try to keep going, or is there a FOUNDATION that I need to make sure I have in order to understand JS’s logic. I wasn’t great in Math, but I do have a BS (not in CS though)… I feel super discouraged, and don’t know what to think. Help..Thank you!
I am coming from a similar position and I would suggest getting Professional Javascript. I have bought both books and even though Zakas covers much more complicated material it is explained as well as it possibly could be.
Some examples are given using complicated mathematical examples but they are actually not as complex as the examples in The Definitive Guide!
Hey friend, I had same problem. Definitive Guide was very dry for me, and I could not understand anything.
Its very easy to understand, very little text, much more exercises. I recommended you, its cheap to.
Hello folks. i am very interesting in starting next Monday. Does anyone wants to form/create new/study group?
Example: Section 6. “Search Text for Your Name” – step 5/7. What the fuck is the point to this exercise? NONE. IT DOESNT EVEN SPELL OUT YOUR NAME (regardless of whether or not all of the characters of your name are in the body text).
Obfuscation != good learning. Retarded examples that are completely pointless, and furthermore don’t make sense != good learning.
Very grateful for this site–there’s a lot of good work here. I’ve tried several sites, and each has taught me something. I like your approach. But:
After faithfully following your “Learn JavaScript Properly” plan, I attempted the “quiz” exercise you described. It was like hitting a brick wall. I’d done every exercise and experimented with code, right up through Try jQuery, and–blam. Just–stymied.
Getting and displaying objects in arrays (quiz items) on a page? Didn’t learn how to do that. Tying Javascript/jQuery and form elements (radio buttons, etc.) together? Nope–didn’t really see that in the book or exercises.
Several other bits, but–am I missing something? The project and the learning just seem so far apart at that point.
I’m worried about the same thing. “Professional Javascript” is a great book (if a bit old at this point), but it’s very abstract. I mean, even when typing out examples and stuff it’s just a bit of a ‘duh’ feeling since of course alert() does exactly what the book just described alert() doing.
I feel weird not doing ANY examples at all until halfway through, and then plowing through a massive example. I’m worried I won’t know where to start (I’m about to complete week 4). Did you do anything to get around this, James?
I am new to programming. I went through the tutorial as suggested. I am unable to complete the quiz exercise on my own.
I just went through Code Academy’s 10 hour JS course and it helped me grasp some concepts I could never truly easily grasp. I would advise anyone to give it a shot. Your advice not to seems poorly-given. This course is step 2 for me.
Since ECMAScript 6 is around the corner, people who are learning ECMAScript 5 or Javascript now are just wasting their time?
Are there any major differences in AngularJS and AngularJS2? I firmly believe that only the syntax changes, but the concepts still remain the same.
I was wondering if there is a reason for skipping chapter 5 of “professional javascript for web developers”?
maybe a late reply but it was merely recommended reading ch. 6 first. In the next step was to read ch.5
Do you have any thoughts on IntelliJ and how it differs (better or worse) than webstorm. I’m using ST2 now but I’m sure to migrate to a more javascipt centric IDE once I’m at that level.
I tried reading “JavaScript for Web Developers” and I just could not get through it. It’s about the driest, most boring technical book I’ve ever (tried) to read. I do_not recommend it.
I just want to sincerely thank you for posting the JavaScript roadmap. I just started week 1 and it’s been great. And your site has so much useful information.
Thanks for the great course! JavaScript is my first programming language, and this guide made learning it much less intimidating.
If I want to learn javascript faster than 4-6 weeks, how many hours do you think I need to put in on a daily basis. I have some background on javascripts but never have written them myself ever, only have read and understood what they r doing. I would appreciate your response. And thank you for putting together this information. It is certainly very helpful.
I love this, I started and finished this roadmap a while back but can’t stop coming again for new stuff.
Just curious but why can’t the 5 little projects be found via the Codeacademy front end? What am I missing?
Now I am sure that there is someone who knows exactly how I feel trying to learn programming. Those words of encouragement are awesome! I will be back to give my testimony. Thanks for the push.
Hi Richard thanks for the great post. I’m pretty much done with the professional javascript for web developers books, and did the try jquery course already. What would you recommend I learn next? Handlebars js, bootstrap, node js, backbone, or your intermediate/ advanced roadmap? Thanks in advance!
I am Nicholas. I congratulate you for your post. It is really great. I assess you to be one of the great programmers. You do take all levels of abilities in to consideration to deliver your subject matter (you are a great teacher). As a .net developer I have read many blogs & articles and few are helpful especially to the new and average developers because they assume readers to know some concepts. as a result you get stuck and confused reading their articles. (Most do not give you guidelines at all and are very inpatient)
But Richard, with your advise, I have followed through to learn javascript properly, now learning backbone and Node.js. I cannot believe my eyes Richard you have made me a better javascript developer. To all reading this, as Richard said, you will be a better programmer if you make the harbit of writing programmes yourself. With the outlines in this blog, you will saved yourself many years of becoming a better developer. Many thanks Sir.
This is a really insightful page that I keep coming back to. However, if I may suggest one improvement, the page seems to be very big while majority of the page is taken up by comments. This can give an impression of a very daunting post, yet most of the pae is filled with comments and not the actual post.
i am going through “Javascript: the definitive guide”, but for some reason only certain examples compute in firebugg or jsfiddle … am i doing something wrong?
Secondly: perhaps silliness on my part, but it took me a while to figure out that the 6-8 weeks schedule refers to a (close to) full time commitment. I started this course alongside a job that eats up about 50 hours of my time per week, and I found that the schedule is too aggressive for me.
Lastly I would like to share my experiences with the two books mentioned by the author. My background: I have studied international management and started working in a support function for a software development company two years ago, in part due to the bad economy in Europe, in part due to an academic background that isn’t exactly high in demand. I have now moved to a new role in product development which requires me to understand JS.
I started with an old copy of The Definitive Guide (1998), then after one chapter got my hands on the most recent print. By chapter 4 I was slightly panicking; I would read a page three times and wouldn’t understand it at all.
I then started over with the Javascript for Professional Webdevelopers book. Although I still encounter difficulties (which is natural), I have found this book to speak my language much better than the Definitive Guide. “My language” meaning that the writing is more attractive to a non-technical reader, examples are clearer.
Just my two cents. If you feel you fall into the same category as I do – coming from a non-technical background – do yourself a favor and compare the two books first, then decide which one you’ll use. I can imagine that JS for Professional Webdevelopers is easier to digest.
I started this last week, and just ordered javascript the Definitive Guide yesterday. I check in today and decide to go to the top of the page only to find that you are changing your track to follow a different book.
Hi Rick, I am changing the book for beginners. I am not changing the regular road map. If you have ever programmed before or if you know just a bit about web development, the book you bought is the best book. But if you have never written code before and you don’t know anything web development, then one of the two new books will be ideal for you.
Thanks for the reply and for the heads up. I decided to make a copy of the lesson plan as it currently is with the reading references to the Definitive Guide. I have some minimal programming experience, but no web-development programming experience. So it is slow. My main interest is to be able to support and modify some .hta apps.
Sorry if I missed it somewhere in the comments, but I started the guide a few weeks ago and noticed it has been recently updated. Do you have a link to the old guide, that way I can keep that as a reference?
Look at the beginning of the actual study guide (not the beginning of the article), you will see two tabs, “Study Guide for Beginners” and “Study Guide for Experience Programmers.” Click on the latter tab. That is the previous study guide. I have not changed it, though I may do so soon. I will add two more Codecademy tracks to it (the “jQuery” track and the “Make an Interactive Website” track). I don’t plan to make significant changes to it.
Thanks for the tip, Kobe. I might have to change the study guide again in a couple of weeks to use the new edition of the book. But not will change anyway, since the 5th edition of the book may be quite similar to the 4th edition.
Have just came across your website today looking for JavaScript learning resources and really like the roadmap you have set out. I have seen that you have mentioned a new update to this post coming in the next few days and you have mentioned two new books. JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development and Beginning JavaScript. Will the new update to the road map include both these books or just one? and if so which one.
So for those of us who want to use the old guide, could you pretty please leave it up? I don’t want to have to get more new books and I think they’re still good (more in depth) compared to the ones you mentioned that are replacing them with.
Hi, I’m wondering if the second edition of the Professional Javascript book would be adequate for following this walkthrough. Are the two editions significantly different?
I’m still in the early steps of your roadmap (which is fantastic by the way) but had a question about your database recommendation. Is there any reason you specifically recommend MongoDB? Are there particular application types that it works best for? Curious to hear your early thoughts on Amazon Aurora, given it’s probably a very attractive pricing model. Thanks!
After reading the 2014 comments I’m a little confused… Is this now up to date? I’m starting fresh and I don’t want to go down the wrong track learning old information and/or using a book that is old or difficult to use. Can you please tell us if the track is completely up to date? Also the books…
Someone mentioned that the 5th edition of “Beginning javaScript” is coming out in a few months. But that book is many months from being ready, so we can’t wait on it, and there is no reason to wait. We are using the 4th edition, available for sale now.
I just finished the first two lessons of your original plan and now see that you have this new set of courses. Should I continue with the previous plan that I am already doing or just wait for the new course to come out?
Thank you so much for this wealth of information on javascript. I had a quick question. There is a new edition for Beginning Javascript due out in March of 2015. I realize you probably don’t know what is in the new edition of the book, but has javascript changed significantly since the last edition (2009) to warrant waiting for the new edition? I realize it’s only 3 or 4 months away, but if it there is a significant difference is it feasible to get started here without the Beginning Javascript book? Thank you for your time.
Eagerly waiting for the new JS courses to launch! And, you will actually help people with marketing themselves to find the dream job? WOW!
Are these upcoming courses something about MEAN (or similar equivalent) JS stack ? As You’ve mentioned self JavaScript is just 35% of what we need to know. The other courses (Meteor, Node, ect) seems to be served in a little bit “messy” order as it’s unclear what (framework?) should be learnt after (or progressively alongside with?) JavaScript.
I’ve started to learn JS totally from scratch (not following this site as I’ve found it just recently) around 2 months ago and I see progress! I want to change my fortunes in job market and I’ve found programming an interesting experience as I feel more and more a valuable person (and proud of myself!). Now I want to keep the momentum (despite many failures and sometimes the feeling I’m just doing myself a fool) and this site seems to be a promise it’s possible to became a web programmer/coder if there’s a dedication to it. Finally there’s a hope and light in the tunnel for people seeking for a change.
First, we will release the course website within three weeks and then the courses will follow soon afterwards. The courses will not be free, but they will be well-worth the cost. Here are just a few of the benefits you will get and why our courses will most beneficial and rewarding to you:
Our courses are painstakingly written and organized and exhaustively edited to ensure you move through the lessons effortlessly and comprehend the topics with ease. We use new and proven techniques to maximize understanding.
You will build a usable real-world application throughout each course, and you will also build your own unique app (that we have pre-architected for you) at the end of each course.
Every course is comprehensive: it covers all the essential and relevant topics, tools, and technologies. Everything you need to learn. Everything. Every course is rigorous: we focus deeply on the material that matters most. And every course has continuity: each lesson builds on the previous one.
You get to choose your final project from a list (each project unique to each student) of projects that we have pre-architected. When you complete the project successfully, either it will be used as part of a global project to end human suffering (yes, many apps are needed) or it will be used as a standalone app to help solve real problems in your community or somewhere else in the world. Of course you can choose to make your own app and do whatever you want to do with it.
After you complete your final project (your app) and the final exam, we will both prepare you for job interviews (including behavioral, programming, and technical questions), help you set up your Modern Developer Profile, as well as connect you with agencies and employers to find a job, even remote jobs. We partner with staffing agencies and companies of every size around the world.
Our format (an online interactive text-based class with schematics, images, and animations) is the most apt format for learning to build web applications. (Video screencast is not the ideal format for learning to build applications; you have to rewind and pause constantly and you never have easy access to crucial course material you will undoubtedly want to refer to time and again. Imagine using a video dictionary or paper book dictionary, as opposed to using a text-based digital dictionary.)
You have full access to the course material upon completion of each course, and forever afterwards, including future updates. Access the content easily and quickly with instant and accurate search, something you can’t do with video courses.
Again, those are just a few of the benefits. When we launch the website later this month, you will be see all the benefits and get more details on each course.
1. I just want to know if I should stop doing your other plan now and instead wait for the courses because it does take a lot of my time and I want to learn everything in the clearest way possible.
2. Also, I noticed you pushed back the courses start date: first it was going to open in 3 days, then in 2 weeks, now you are saying 3 weeks. I imagine you are just putting the final touches on… May we expect a couplre more weeks on top of that as well?
3. How do you expect this to compare, in hireability with hackreactor.com or other bootcamps out there?
4. any programmer home remedy fixes for carpal tunnel? I noticed my wrists are starting to hurt a little…
1. You don’t have to stop learning, but since you are short on time, you really don’t have to follow the current study guide, since we will cover everything (and a lot more) that is covered in the study guide above.
2. The date I posted was really for the “Modern Developer Technology Guide” and the course website. The actual courses are still a few weeks away. Unlike most online courses that teach you just JavaScript or any single technology, our courses teach everything (all the related and necessary technologies and tools you actually have to learn and use to build modern web apps). On top of that, we will build a real world web app throughout each course and continue improving the app in other advanced courses. And, we have to pre-architect a unique final project (web app) for each student. All the final projects will be used to help human suffering around the world. Seriously. I could go on and on, but you get the point. Our courses are comprehensive and require ample time to prepare. The bottom line is that the first course should be ready in late January and the others soon after.
3. Hireability is much different, since they don’t offer courses like we will. HackReactor is ridiculously expensive. Did you see the cost? It is not much different from attending an expensive University, which is totally unnecessary just to become a modern web developer. Nowadays people are dropping out of college to start startups, so why go in the reverse direction? Our cost will be about 60X less than Hack Reactor’s tuition. And you can follow our courses anytime and at your own pace, from anywhere in the world. You will learn as much and probably more and you will build a real project that you can be proud of, since it will actually solve real human problems around the world or in your community. Bootcamp is similar to HackReactor.
4. Yes, your wrist may hurt in the beginning, especially if you suddenly start typing a lot. I would recommend you check out your doctor (or even Google ), since I am not qualified to give you the best advise on carpal tunnel.
I have 3 more general questions about programming. Anyone with true proven industry experience is welcome to answer.
1. A question about age of programmers. I’m 37 and I would take your courses and would be serious to be a developer. I live in San Francisco and it seems that all the programmer here are young guys. Will a company be less likely to hire me based on age?
2. How easy is it to work anywhere in the world? If I wanted to find a job after a year of experience, is it common to find jobs where one can work remotely? Even say in another country?
3. In 2001 I got “MCSE certified” to work as a microsoft network administrator. I never actually worked as one but I did work in a help desk. I noticed that the technology changed compeletely after I learned what I had learned. Does this happen this quickly in programming as well? If I put hard earned time into learning html/css and javascript and the other things; next year will I then need to learn a whole bunch of other stuff or risk becoming an obsolete programmer?
a big thanks for the study guide!, I am now on first week, im taking my time now each day, im glad to share this to my friends!
I bought javascript 7th Edition Bible by Danny Goodman. Can I still follow your lessons by following the right section in the book I have corresponding to each of your lesson?
hai sir, is it possible to learnt java script in w3 school or not.may i know best way to learnt java script please
I just switched from Ruby to JavaScript and it is really weird for me. I want to learn JS from the ground up, ins and out about this language.
I was wondering if the courses will offer any “taster” for people to try and see how it’s structured before paying?
Don’t worry; you will get all the details about the courses soon. The course website will provide you with every detail you need. Be sure to enter your email in the “Receive Updates” form above, so that you will receive updates when the course website and the courses are released.
You should put a disclaimer on your pages letting readers know that you gain a percentage of sales from the amazon purchases. You could put it on your about page, where you imply that the only reason you are putting these pages up is to give back, when in fact you hope to gain some profit. And also, the long blurb about the upcoming course that you will be offering is exceptionally distracting when trying to access some of the pages, and the fact that the comments reload the page and put you back at the top is also annoying. The comment hierarchy is also backward–newest comments are on the bottom. Some of the pages are also exceptionally long but there is no navigation to move about them. As it is now, your site reminds me of those body building pages that offer ways to make quick muscle gains. That’s not sexy.
Hi the learning track is aggressive for someone who works, but I’m working my way through it at my own pace. I think the program is good. When will the other courses mentioned be posted? I’m waiting patently.
First of all, I love this tutorial blog. It’s fantastic and it has really helped me break ground learning javascript. A few notes on some of the subject matter when building the quiz.
2. Chrome won’t let me use AJAX without a server and was throwing me cross-domain request errors when I was running from a file from my computer.
I would like to start to follow this study guide, but for me its hard to get the books. Wold be hard for you to add a alternative study guide using one of the free js books from this site: http://jsbooks.revolunet.com/
Thanks again for this great course outline. This is my attempt at the first version of the quiz, with a few bullets from the ‘improve’ section:
Some background about me: I’ve entered the software industry 2,5 years ago coming from a completely different, non-technical, academic background with slim job prospects in my field of study. I landed a customer support role at a software company and stepped up to the role of product support engineer after two years. I support two senior developers and a senior manager (former developer also).
My job requires me to at least know JavaScript, but the team develops libraries for mobile applications and web applications of all sorts, so a lot of languages are covered across the team. I will not become a developer but I will be responsible for internal technical support and testing the teams releases. My manager is very cool in that he puts his trust in me and allows me to study on the job.
Having no experience with web development, the css and html parts of the quiz were tricky- and looking back I made it harder on myself by wanting to use neat animations from Animate.css. Next steps are to implement to quiz with our company’s software (not the version on jsfiddle) and to expand it using the ‘improve’ section.
so, i started this path about a year back and honestly dropped it. Didn’t like the book, felt it was dry. However I wanted to start it again but may be better with accountability. Is another group of persons doing this again?
I just spent 10 minutes on codeacademy learning how to type “string”.length, 2+2, and confirm(“foo”). It is the slowest, worst way to learn anything I have ever seen in 15 years of college, possibly except for watching videos. If you can’t learn this stuff in 1/10th the time, you shouldn’t be a coder.
The 5th Edition of Beginning JavaScript is now out. I’m going to buy it and follow this track! Thanks
For Beginners, I want to be clear how many of the Code Academy lessons I should do in week 1. I have completed HTML Basics, Build Your Own Webpage, HTML Basics II, Social Networking Profile, HTML Basics III,
and Clickable Photo Page. For week 1, I think I still need to complete CSS An Overview, Design a Button for your Website. Is that correct? And CSS Selectors, Sorting Your Friends Build a Resume, CSS Positioning and Build a Resume. Should I also complete these during my first week? Not clear what is considered part of the four tracts that the outline for the first week mentions when it says, “We will complete 4 Codecademy tracks.”.
I’m using the Professional Javascript for web developers book and the JSON chapter doesn’t cover how to use AJAX to connect to the file etc. Is there another chapter I should be reading to cover that?
Jack, stop complaining, it’s petty and rude. If you are jealous about what this guy is doing then do it yourself. You’ll then realize the huge amount of knowledge, time and effort required to produce a piece of work like this. Software development is a lifetime of learning and hard work. The author has every right to earn a small amount of commission if you buy a book that he recommends. He is also giving his expert advice on which books to buy and so helping you avoid wasting money on others that may be unsuitable. That advice alone more than justifies the commission that Amazon will pay. And remember it doesn’t cost you a penny. Why don’t you show your appreciation, buy a book and read it along with all the other free content on this excellent learning resource. You may as well. You don’t seem to have much else to do!
Thank you SOOO much for this guidelines. I’ve been looking for something like this for a time. I was one of those people who tried to learn javascript from here and there without any structure. I’m so excited for this course!
Hi thank you for the superb tutorial, my question is can I read Head First JavaScript programming instead of Beginning JavaScript book because both of these books are meant for absolute beginners. which one is better??? .
recently i have started learning progrmming languages….i m intrested in java script….how could i learn it in easy way…i m beginner in programming never done coding before….

Hello, I was feeling lost trying to learn Javascript on my own and I believe your guide will really help me. Thank you for your efforts and I look forward to working through your well organized program.
I’m not learned yet JavaScript, but I wish I will learn this language. This article motivated me to learn JS as soon as possible. Thanks javascriptissexy.com for this excellent guide for beginner and expert.
Hi, visual learner here. I saw your suggestion for JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development to replace Beginning JavaScript, and it looks like that is the book for me. But I was trying to get an idea of which chapters would replace which, because they don’t really line up together, and I was wondering if maybe you could update us with the alternate chapters of the second book, if possible. Just so that I can make sure I am reading the right sections.
Anyway, thank you for this great resource, and if I end up having to just get both books then I will do it, because this has been the best resource so far since I can’t afford to take the courses on your site just yet.
Question- Can I substitute CodeSchool with Codecademy to satisfy the study guide? I just subscribed to CS and would like to use that as it seems to be more challenging than Codecademy. Also, should I just follow the same order of topics in CodeSchool to that of what I should be reading in the book?

Nicely guided. Being web designer, i desperately need to learn javascript but could not step up forward. Can you help me in learning Javascript? mail me at : arulgg@gmail.com
Apparently a lot of the “try it out” sections in the 4th edition beginner javascript is outdated and doesn’t really work any more. The 5th edition works just fine though FYI.
Thanks for building this guide. I came to the end of codecademy and got stuck pretty hard building my site and trying to contribute to github. After diving into the reading materials and doing these end of chapter exercises I can see why.
I am a designer and programming is totally new to me. I started with Codcademy’s Javascript track like you said. They started with the very basics of programming which was something that really really help me understand the core concepts of Javascript. The book you referred further helped me clarify the concepts. I can’t find any words to thank you for taking your time to show beginner like me a path to learn javascript programming. Thank you very much Richard.
first many thanks for what you are doing it’s absolutely an outstanding work here helping all the community 😀

Where can you experience beautiful, exciting art of all kinds? In Jackson Hole, the answer is: Almost everywhere you look!
I don't think anyone wants to hear more about the election, but no one reads this blog anyway, so you're safe. Or, er, no that doesn't make sense, but nothing about this election made sense, so that's fitting. Or something. I don't write a lot about politics anymore, and I'm not generally interested in knee-jerk analysis, but that's all we've got right now. My instinct is try and understand what happened in a broad sense, and everyone is so shell-shocked right now (even the "winners", mostly) that they're just reverting to their previously held biases. From what I can see, almost every explanation for the election played a role. I won't go so far as to say that there were 118 million reasons why people voted the way they did, but to pin it all on one thin explanation is also pretty foolish. Statistics failed us pretty well in this election, so I want to know more about that, and about why things are the way they are. This is easy to say for me, and others are in much worse shape, but I'm trying not to let all the anger and fear or joy and elation influence me too much.
Election 2016: Exit Polls - Various demographics can be interesting, but the real goofy part is that literally all of the polling up until the election was dramatically wrong, yet we're treating these exit polls like gospel. The polling was wrong, let's base our diagnosis of the election on more polls! Intuitively, most of these aren't that surprising, but that's kinda the point. Intuitively, Donalt Trump had no real chance of winning either.
Voter Turnout Fell, Especially In States That Clinton Won - Turnout numbers, at least, are probably more reliable. It was a douche and turd election, few seemed to actually like who they were voting for, and that generally leads to lower turnout. Yes, I know that you think the choice was clear, but the majority of Americans seemed pretty apathetic about their choices. But here I am speculating based on polling again. Oof.
A Running List Of Reported Racist Incidents After Donald Trump's Victory - This shit is unacceptable. I don't think bigotry was the main driving force behind Trump's victory (partly because I don't think there is a single, main driving force, but rather dozens of smaller ones), but it's impossible to ignore this wave of xenophobic bullshit. I have not personally seen anything like this and I'm hoping that it will quickly subside, but I've read too many stories like this since the election. If you can do something about it, please do.
Louisiana student 'fabricated' story of hijab attack, police say - Well, shit. I'm consistently baffled by stuff like this. There's enough genuine bullshit going around, why do you have to support those that would dismiss it by fabricating an attack?
Bystanders yell anti-Trump taunts as man beaten after car crash - And hey, this ain't great either. What the hell is going on.
Stumped by Trump’s success? Take a drive outside US cities - A lot of stuff from before the election suddenly seems more relevant these days:
While Trump supporters here are overwhelmingly white, their support has little to do with race (yes, you’ll always find one or two who make race the issue), but has a lot to do with a perceived loss of power.
Not power in the way that Washington or Wall Street boardrooms view power, but power in the sense that these people see a diminishing respect for them and their ways of life, their work ethic, their tendency to not be mobile. (Many live in the same eight square miles that their father’s father’s father lived in.)
Thirty years ago, such people determined the country’s standards in entertainment, music, food, clothing, politics, personal values. Today, they are the people who are accused of creating every social injustice imaginable; when anything in society fails, they get blamed.
The places where they live lack economic opportunities for the next generation; they know their children and grandchildren will never experience the comfortable situations they had growing up - surrounded by family who lived next door, able to find a great job without going to college, both common traits among many successful small-business owners in the state.
This has been a pretty common thread that I've seen. Many have been dismissing this view or blaming it on something other than what it is. Of course, I'm doubting that Trump can actually provide what these voters think, but its hard to dismiss their complaints. It also illustrates the divide between city and rural, which is not really new. But where there used to be at least some semblance of balance in our culture between this geographic divide, it no longer feels that way. The divide is growing. I realize it might be silly to look at horror movies for insight here, but hey, I just spent a month and a half watching them, and one thing that often pops up is the city/country divide. Carol Clover wrote about this in a chapter concerning rape-revenge films like I Spit on Your Grave and Deliverance and delved in to a more general "Urbanoia":
The city/country split is by no means confined to the rape-revenge film - or even revenge films in general. An enormous proportion of horror takes as its starting point the visit or move of (sub)urban people to the country. ... Going from city to country in horror film is in any case very much like going from village to deep, dark forest in tradional fairy tales. ... One of the obvious things at stake in the city/country split of horror films, in short, is social class - the confrontation between the haves and have-nots, or even more directly, between exploiters and their victims.
There is, of course, lots to unpack there, and as mentioned above, this can't explain everything, but it does seem to be a base disagreement that is driving divisions in this country. People in the city/country divide are dismissing each other with ever more vigor, and that probably plays a small part in what's going on here.
To the supporters of Donald Trump - Jason Kottke wrote a bit about this in July and tied it to Tyler Cowan's description of Brexit:
Many Americans share a frustration of the current political system and how it is wielded against us in our name by skilled political practitioners, but I do not believe the US is a country filled with small-minded, intolerant racists, despite the perplexing level of national support for a proudly dishonest and bigoted TV personality, whatever his keen political instincts. Trump is the one lever being given to those frustrated voters for sending a message to their politicians and many are choosing to use it despite many of the reasons listed in that letter. Sending that message is more important than its potential consequences.
This goes to the "outsider" view of the election, another common theme. Again, I doubt Trump will actually be able to deliver on what these voters actually want, but their complaints are valid. Part of the Trump win? Sure, but not all of it, which also seems to be a common theme.
Trump Won Because Leftist Political Correctness Inspired a Terrifying Backlash - This is another example of someone using the election to harp on one of their hobby horses, but it's not entirely wrong either.
If you're a leftist reading this, you probably think that's stupid. You probably can't understand why someone would get so bent out of shape about being told their words are hurtful. You probably think it's not a big deal and these people need to get over themselves. Who's the delicate snowflake now, huh? you're probably thinking. I'm telling you: your failure to acknowledge this miscalculation and adjust your approach has delivered the country to Trump.
There's a related problem: the boy-who-cried-wolf situation. I was happy to see a few liberals, like Bill Maher, owning up to it. Maher admitted during a recent show that he was wrong to treat George Bush, Mitt Romney, and John McCain like they were apocalyptic threats to the nation: it robbed him of the ability to treat Trump more seriously. The left said McCain was a racist supported by racists, it said Romney was a racist supported by racists, but when an actually racist Republican came along—and racists cheered him - it had lost its ability to credibly make that accusation.
This is akin to the political-correctness-run-amok problem: both are examples of the left's horrible over-reach during the Obama years. The leftist drive to enforce a progressive social vision was relentless, and it happened too fast. I don't say this because I'm opposed to that vision - like most members of the under-30 crowd, I have no problem with gender neutral pronouns - I say this because it inspired a backlash that gave us Trump.
Once again, I don't think this is the only reason the country went for Trump... but it played a role.
I understand that there is anger and fear right now. But, I just got through 8 years of hearing from extremely conservative friends and family about how Obama is not their president. It did not make me want to lend credibility to anything they said regarding him after that. Like it or not, Trump will be your president. Claiming otherwise is the most divisive thing you could do right now. He does not have a mandate and by all means, let there be fierce opposition to every unconstitutional and harmful policy he proposes. The important thing is to keep this country a place where you can openly criticize your president, assemble to protest your president, read about your president in the free press and where a president can be impeached if necessary and most of all, where power continues to peacefully be transferred from one president to the next one.
I could keep going on here, but if there's one thing I'm trying to keep in mind, it's that there's no easy explanation for an election result, especially this election. Everyone who is writing about it seems to think they've identified that one, key component... and it just happens to conform perfectly to their worldview. Voter turnout, bigotry, third party voters, politically correct wolf-crying, city/country divide, immigration, bathrooms?, single-issue voters, capitalism/socialism, Russian influence (fucking Russia?), the list goes on and on and on. No one of these things put us where we are, but we can't really dismiss any of them out of hand either.
One other thing I've noticed in the past few years, on both sides of the divide, is a lack of respect for free speech. I feel like it's been constantly dismissed in the past few years in favor of [insert preferred ideology here]. Again, this goes both ways. Trump has repeatedly threatened free speech because he's such a crybaby. Many on the left decry speech they disagree with too (you could argue that the politically correct stuff feeds into that). But now we're really going to need free speech. This country has safeguards to protect against wannabe authoritarians, and free speech is one of them. We need to be vigilant about stuff like that. One of the reasons I'm always cautious about executive power and the expansion of federal power is that you never know who's going to wield it next. You may have been comfortable with Bush or Obama wielding certain powers, but now Trump has them. Are you still comfortable?
Unfollowing angry folks. Love you guys, but I need to limit my intake of anger or I can't work. You're still great. Hope you find joy again.
I think @Jezebel's "Fuck your ideas, why won't you vote the way we say you inferior ignorant bigot fucks" strategy just might work.
Amidst an election some are arguing is only about racism, David Duke got 3% of the vote. He received 38.8% in 1991 https://t.co/rnl5tI3ijv
Protests are a good thing. So is harsh, even silly, language aimed directly at those in power. The root indicator of a free country.
Alright, that's enough of that. I'm still trying to understand and none of the above is meant to dismiss or harangue anyone with unwanted advice. The only advice I have comes from Bill and Ted: Be excellent to each other. We now return you to your regularly scheduled SF/Movies programming.
I am way late in responding here but what the hell, why not? I do want to say good on you for the idea that it isn't just one big thing that drove the election the way it went but more likely a bunch of different, little things. There's been a lot of political discussions between acquaintances I've been lurking in on across various social media (mostly lurking, because I think I blew out all my will to debate politics on the internet years ago) and if it's taught me anything it's that the people I was surprised to see voted for Trump did so for equally surprising reasons.
Cheers Dave, It's still appreciated. I haven't written much about politics in a while, so I'm glad to see it resonated at least a little bit, and like you, I've been seeing more diverse explanations than is typically reported. Doing my best to keep a level head, because I learned a long time ago that getting pissed off doesn't make me very productive.

Greetings to all my friends and family. I have finally, after far too many years, updated the website to reflect the changes in my life. One of the biggest changes is that I have the wonderful Carol Pruzan in my life again after 40 plus years. I think the other two that are most significant would have to be having my music back again, and IBM pushing me into an unwilling and early retirement.
As part of this new website, I will be including copies of my original music, and if I can make some good recordings, the inclusion of some music files, lyrics and chords. All the music that I post is considered copyrighted material, but if anyone likes something and wishes to perform it for profit, I ask only that you contact me to let me know in advance.
I will also be posting some photos and family news as the days progress. I am going to attempt to be more active in keeping this current. Let me know what your thoughts are, and I may even include you here as well!!
Click on projects (above) to go to my project page. From there, links are available from which you can reach my music, movies and other things that might be of interest.

Do you see many children playing outside when you drive home from work? Although kids once spent long periods of time outdoors in previous generations, today's youth are less likely to enjoy spontaneous games of hide and seek or kickball. In fact, parents of eight to 12-year-olds reported that their kids spend three times as much time using computers and watching TV as they do playing outside, according to The Nature of Americans National Report. Unfortunately, lack of outdoor time can make it hard to see clearly.
Lack of exposure to sunlight has been linked to an increased incidence of myopia in children. Myopia, commonly called nearsightedness, makes it difficult to see distant objects clearly without prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses. The refractive error occurs when the eye becomes too long from the front to the back. As a result, light rays don't focus directly on the retina, but in front of it.
Although wearing glasses has always been a part of childhood for some children, myopia rates have been increasing lately. Genetics certainly plays a role in myopia. Children of myopic parents are more likely to develop myopia themselves, but inheritance isn't necessarily the sole cause of nearsightedness. Close work, like reading or working on computers for hours at a time, may increase the chance that a child will develop the refractive error.
In most cases, myopia is merely an inconvenience, but it can cause other eye problems in adulthood if it's severe. Retinal tears, cataracts, retinal and vitreous detachments, glaucoma and macular degeneration may be more likely to occur if you need corrective lenses greater than 5 diopters.
In the past, myopia rates remained fairly steady, but that's changed in the last several decades. Myopia cases increased by 66 percent from 1971-72 and 1999-2004, according to a National Eye Institute Research Study. Researchers believe that the increase is due to fewer hours spent outdoors and increased reliance on digital devices, like smartphones, laptops and tablets.
Increasing outdoor exposure can have a very beneficial effect on kids' eyes. Chinese children who spent an additional 40 minutes outdoors every day experienced a lower level of myopia when compared to their classmates who remained indoors. Another study determined that children who have myopic parents but spend 14 hours outside weekly have the same risk of developing nearsightedness as peers whose parents aren't myopic.
Although it may not be possible to prevent every case of myopia, you can reduce your child's chances of becoming nearsighted by:
Encouraging More Outdoor Time. Spending an hour or two outdoors every day is a simple way to protect your child's vision.
Limiting Digital Devices. Reducing the time your child spends playing games or surfing the Internet not only offers protection against myopia, but also prevents painful back and neck pain that can occur when your son or daughter bends his or her neck to view digital devices.
Requiring Frequent Breaks. Whether your child is an avid reader or gamer, ask him or her to take breaks every half hour for at least 20 minutes. Breaks are the perfect time to spend a little time outdoors.
Provide Foods That Nourish the Eyes. Foods that offer vitamins A, C, E or other nutrients necessary for good vision can help your child reduce his or her risk of developing several eye disease and conditions, including cataracts, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. Vision-friendly foods include carrots, peppers, whole grains, dairy products, salmon, citrus fruits, blueberries, spinach and other dark, leafy vegetables.
Increased outdoor time, reduced reliance on digital devices and regular visits to the optometrist can help you protect your child's vision. If it's time for a vision exam, or your son or daughter has been complaining of blurred vision, headaches or eyestrain, call us to schedule an appointment.

Yesterday, we learned that the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of Westboro Baptist Church and their protests at the funerals of service men and women. Westboro Baptist Church, which is Baptist in name only, has been in the news often during the past few years for their protests and use of hate speech. At one of their protests, you are likely to see signs that read, “Thank God for Dead Soldiers,” “God Hates Fags,” and “You’re Going to Hell.” These are not our kind of Baptists. These are the kind of people who give Baptists a bad name. These are the kind of people who are participating in things that do not show the love of God to a lost and dying world. I see no way to condone anything about the actions of these people. And yet, this ruling is good news.
As much as we would like to see the Westboro Baptist Church protests stop, this ruling is a victory for free speech. Let’s turn this around. Not that long ago, a street preacher in another country was out preaching the gospel. A gay police officer decided he didn’t like the guy, asked him what the Bible said about homosexuality and took the preacher to jail when the preacher gave an honest answer. The only justification for taking someone to jail for that is that it cause someone (the police officer) emotional distress. The good news for this country is that in an overwhelming decision of 8 to 1, the Supreme Court ruled that even something as emotionally distressing as telling grieving people that they are going to hell while they are attending the funeral of their child isn’t a valid reason to limit the freedom of speech.
Had this ruling gone the other way, it is conceivable that anyone who disagreed with something we had to say would claim emotional distress and take us to court. Christians would have lost the most because of this. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but the Bible is emotionally distressing for the lost. Even the Bible itself tells us this. “For the Word of God is living and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” (Hebrews 4:12)
Yes, I wish Westboro Baptist Church would let families grieve in peace, but this court case is a great victory for the First Amendment protections we enjoy. It is this freedom that protects us not only when we are preaching and teaching within the walls of our church buildings but when we are out on the streets of our community.
Steve Laube talked about this book trailer on his blog the other day. Okay, I’m impressed with the production quality, but it doesn’t really give me any reason to buy the book. It doesn’t really tell me anything about what I can expect to find in the book if I read it. What is the benefit to me?
At first, I thought it was a pro-life book, since it showed the image of a baby on the preview, but that doesn’t appear to be the case. The title of the book seems to imply that it is a list of prices. I can’t think of why I would want that, though I doubt that is what it is. My conclusion is that this trailer is a huge waste of money.
What do you think of trailers for books? Do you think they are beneficial or are they all a waste of money? What do you think of publishers requiring their authors to pay for trailers for their books?

(1) That the Association works through existing channels to make an input to European regional policy development.
(2) That local twinning links are reviewed to see if they can be better co-ordinated into a sub regional framework.
1.1 This report identifies regional European issues where the Association may wish to consider whether and how it can influence policy to benefit Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. These issues are now framed in the context of the European strategy and agenda for SEEDA and SEERA.
2.1 At the European level, Counties are regarded as regions as they are the level of elected government below the state. Counties, including Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, have been involved in European activity over many years and have taken full advantage of opportunities to influence European regional policy through networks such as the Assembly of European Regions (AER) and the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions (CPMR). These have offered both access to political activity and lobbying for regional issues and the opportunity to work on partnership projects and exchange experience with regions across Europe – within and beyond those of the 15 Member States of the European Union. Hampshire County Council has had a European strategy for many years that reflects its role as a European region.
2.2 The establishment of Regional Development Agencies and Regional Chambers have added a new dimension to local authorities' European activity. SEEDA, in its Regional Economic Strategy (RES), includes a short introductory section on the European dimension and will be developing a European strategy. The RES identifies key issues for the South East in terms of its location, its position as a business gateway to European markets and partnership opportunities in training, research, regeneration and development.
2.3 SEEDA is committed to working with SEERA, and they have set up a Joint Europe Committee (JEC), made up of five Members from each and jointly serviced by SEEDA's European officer and a local authority European officer from the South East European Officers Group.
2.4 SEEDA is also committed to setting up South East representation in Brussels and is in discussions with local authorities that currently have representation as to how these may be brought into partnership, and also with those that do not as to whether they wish to "buy in" to a South East representative office. There are still a range of issues to be worked through including premises, management and functional questions.
2.5 A new funding framework for the European Union comes into place for the period 2000-2006. This is as a result of consultations over the past couple of years on Agenda 2000. The major changes are in the objective status areas and the beginnings of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, to prepare the way for enlargement. It is not yet clear what the role of SEEDA and GOSE will be in new funding arrangements, but there will be a stronger regional role in some programmes – for example the European Social Fund, where programmes will have to be related to the RES.
2.6 This year's European elections have returned, for the first time, a group of 11 South East MEP's. They were elected on a list system and represent the region. There is no longer geographical constituency representation.
2.7 The above framework of changes in regional bodies, funding and representation raise a number of issues where the Association should consider how Hampshire and the Isle of Wight can ensure the particular interests, strengths and issues of this area can be reflected. These are:
It is important to keep MEP's informed of issues of importance to the Association where they can lobby on its behalf. South East MEP's are on the following committees of the European Parliament:
The Hampshire/Isle of Wight Brussels office produces a regular newsletter to keep MEP's informed of current issues, and the Association can make use of this if it wishes to.
3.2 Hampshire and Isle of Wight will continue to be active members of AER and CPMR, and there may be other networks constituent authorities belong to which could be useful. This provides another route for lobbying on issues and for developing partnerships.
Current membership of the JEC includes Bryan Davies from SEEDA and Councillor Harry Rees from SEERA, both of whom can be useful local contacts. The JEC is advised and supported by the South East European Officers Group, which is regularly attended by officers from Hampshire, Isle of Wight and the two Cities.
Hampshire and the Isle of Wight currently have a partnership with Dorset for the Brussels office, and the premises are shared with Basse-Normandie region. These arrangements will continue at least in the short term while SEEDA negotiate on South East representation.
Funding opportunities for this area will become more restricted with the new funding framework, and projects will need to be well focused and presented. KONVER, for defence diversification and which has been of considerable benefit to Hampshire, disappears. A bid has been put forward for Hampshire to be designated an eligible area for INTERREG III A to support cross-border, maritime activity with its partner region of Basse-Normandie. The case has been strongly supported by Districts and the Cities and other Hampshire organisation as well as GOSE and MEP's. If successful, this programme would bring significant funds to Hampshire.
3.6 The main source of structural funds will be the European Social Fund (ESF) for skills and training. This will be allocated on the basis of regional plans which will need to link to SEEDA RES. The local authorities currently run a network group for ESF, which Hampshire, Isle of Wight and the Cities attend and it will remain important to input to this group.
3.7 As the new funding framework develops and it becomes clearer how funds are managed and disbursed at a regional level, there may be a need to consider whether and how this area can best be represented on any management committees that are set up.
There are a number of specialist areas where Hampshire and the Isle of Wight have expertise and experience that should be used to contribute to European policy development – for example rural development and the opportunities for new activity under LEADER+. Currently this work is being pursued through the Committee for Rural Hampshire and links with MAFF. Environmental issues are clearly important to Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. The New Forest is currently benefiting from funds from the LIFE environmental programme and work is also underway on developing bio-diversity indicators with EU funded support. This work should provide experience and expertise that can be disseminated to inform best practice and future policy. Hampshire has been particularly successful in attracting funds for IT/telematics projects – eg ROMANSE, TourISt INFOVILLe projects – which support the EU's Information Society policy development. Again, these provide models for other regions to learn from.
3.9 The Isle of Wight has received substantial funding under the LIFE programme for two projects carried out by the Coastal Management Unit. One of these was a pilot project on Coastal Management, the results of which are being fed into the 5th Environmental Action Plan and will thereby influence European environmental policy.
4.1 This report has tried to identify European issues on a regional basis where the Association needs to keep informed and where it can influence policy development. It is clear that there are existing channels of communication both at Member and officer level where Hampshire and the Isle of Wight authorities make a contribution.
4.2 The report has not addressed more local issues of projects and partnerships – twinning and other links which make a contribution to local economies, raise direct local awareness of European issues and provide grassroots examples of European activity. It may be worth looking at these local links to see if they can be put into a more coherent sub regional framework, to add value to their activities.

The original Ping Glide wedge was one of the best cavity back wedges in the market and now Ping has put a little spin on it with version 2.0.
The same clean lines and Hydropearl chrome finish repel water to enable the Glide 2.0 to slip through the turf and this is a professional looking wedge.
The main change is a slight refinement of the grooves by Ping using their precision milling to steepen the sides of the walls on the grooves by 4°.
On the lower 46° to 52° lofts this increases the side wall angle from 16° to 20° and there is also an extra groove on the face too. On the higher lofts from 54° to 60° the wall is also now up 4° to 28° and these wedges get two extra grooves.
Ping claim that on full shots you will get an extra 200rpm in the dry and 1000rpm in the wet, which is pretty signficant. Out on the course the grip was certianly there and this is a good improvement on a groove that was already one of the better performing ones.
There is the same choice of 4 sole grinds to vary the bounce, from the lower bounce Thin Sole (TS) through the Standard Sole (SS), Wide Sole (WS) and the Eye Sole (ES), which has the inverted cavity from the classic Ping Eye 2 wedge and is particularly good out of sand.
Compared to the previous version, the soles are very similar in shape with the numbers now on the toe and provide the right level of bounce for the required shot.
There is a decent amount of heel and toe relief if you like to play around with opening and closing the face and this works really well on the higher lofted 58° SS, which had a lovely balance and was easy to flip the ball up.
The only change in the lofts is that the SS starts at 46° instead of 47°, so there is no 48° version and that is probably because this is there as an alternative to the 45° or 46° set wedges that you get in the i200 and iBlade irons respectively.
As most specialist wedges are blade style and most irons these days are cavity backs of some description, then the Ping Glide 2.0 will fit into most sets as it will keep the cavity back theme going and I like that concept.They will of course blend in particularly well with the Ping i200 and iBlade thanks to the similar looks.
The 2.0 also retains the longer Dyla-wedge grip that gives you reference points if you like to grip down the shaft in order to vary the distance the ball goes with the same length of swing.
This is a clever device and it is good to see it continued as an option to the standard variable width Ping grips.
All the models come with Ping's AWT 2.0 Wedge shaft which weights slightly less than the previous CFS shaft and should give a little higher trajectory.
Overall this is another great wedge from Ping and more of a fine tuning of the original Glide, because when it comes to cavity back wedges, they have already hit the target.
In January 2018 Ping extended the range with the Glide 2.0 Stealth wedge, which is the same shape and style as the original but in a black QPQ (Quench Polish Quench) finish.
Ping claim that the darker finish reduces glare and makes the head look smaller at address, which it may do, but I have yet to be blinded by a club and bigger is better in my book.
The only other difference is the milling of an extra half groove in the space at the bottom of the face to add a little extra spin, especially on those shots hit lower on the face and we are not talking thins here.
It still performs just as well as the standard model so if you prefer this darker look, especially if you get some good wear marks going, then the Glide 2.0 Stealth wedge is going to steal the show.
After 20+ years of Cleveland wedges I was curiously shopping different brands this spring. I took a 56 demo out to give it a go. I was quite impressed after my trial session. I bought a 50,56, and 60 all with the SS grind. They have been in the bag for four months. Just excellent performing wedges. Forgiveness, accuracy, and great bite. So happy I switched.
Had an old $20 56 degree sand wedge with a bent shaft and scratch up head. Decided I needed an upgrade. Bought the 56 WS and boy was it an upgrade! I knew when I stopped a shot dead from 20 yards in the next holes tee box when I missed a shot left I had a keeper. This wedge has transformed my game from about 80 yards in. I have had more kick in birdies from 60-80 out since October with this wedge than I’ve had in my entire golf career prior. I’ve always been good at flop shots around the green and from the bunker so this has not been that impactful there but from those crucial yardage’s for 2nd shots after big drives or coming in on a par 5 for a 3rd I have never been able to control my spin and distance like I can with this wedge!
Spinny wedges, man! Compared with other top name wedges, from 1k to 2k more spin on full shots. If you need to spin a quarter chip shot from 5 ft off the green to a pin down hill 5 yards away, I don't know any other club that can make it stop like these. Flop shots really flop, too! I let one of my playing pards use my 60 degree and he tried to steal it! Well, he tried to bet his driver for my wedge, but his driver wasn't a Ping so no deal, baby! THEN he put it in his bag. (He's an easy mark, so I forgive his kleptomania most times). I have 52, 54, 58, 60 and a couple of different grinds, so I mix and match. Yeah, I loves me some short game! If you don't like yours, send it to me and I'll send you a B* B* driver that I just won in a bet!
I was fortunate enough to get a 60 degree 2.0 wedge thin sole version through PGA Tour caddie I know & damn, I never thought I'd like Ping wedges, but this wedge is off the hook. Love it - it's a great wedge.
I have the 54 degree SS. Wow! Amazing! I can now execute the flop shot with confidence. It really does 'glide' through the rough easily. This transformed my short game to the next level and more. Need the 58 degree SS next.
Played a few rounds with new wedges 52ss and 58 es. Love both and the 58 is butter from the traps. Also, SS is great as well. Have played Vokey for sometime now and can say these are more forgiving. Would recommend to anyone looking to increase their short game.
Seriously good wedges. Anyone from Tour player to high handicap can benefit from these with the right specs. They are also the highest spinning wedges on the market!

Hello, of course this article is in fact good and I have learned lot of things from it about blogging. thanks.
I’m really loving the theme/design of your blog. Do you ever run into any internet browser compatibility issues? A small number of my blog audience have complained about my blog not operating correctly in Explorer but looks great in Firefox. Do you have any solutions to help fix this problem?
Nice post. I learn something totally new and challenging on websites I stumbleupon everyday. It’s always helpful to read through articles from other writers and use something from their web sites.
I do not even understand how I stopped up right here, however I assumed this submit was good. I don’t realize who you’re but certainly you are going to a well-known blogger should you aren’t already. Cheers!
This design is wicked! You certainly know how to keep a reader entertained. Between your wit and your videos, I was almost moved to start my own blog (well, almost…HaHa!) Great job. I really enjoyed what you had to say, and more than that, how you presented it. Too cool!
The new Zune browser is surprisingly good, but not as good as the iPod’s. It works well, but isn’t as fast as Safari, and has a clunkier interface. If you occasionally plan on using the web browser that’s not an issue, but if you’re planning to browse the web alot from your PMP then the iPod’s larger screen and better browser may be important.
Hands down, Apple’s app store wins by a mile. It’s a huge selection of all sorts of apps vs a rather sad selection of a handful for Zune. Microsoft has plans, especially in the realm of games, but I’m not sure I’d want to bet on the future if this aspect is important to you. The iPod is a much better choice in that case.
If you’re still on the fence: grab your favorite earphones, head down to a Best Buy and ask to plug them into a Zune then an iPod and see which one sounds better to you, and which interface makes you smile more. Then you’ll know which is right for you.
Sorry for the huge review, but I’m really loving the new Zune, and hope this, as well as the excellent reviews some other people have written, will help you decide if it’s the right choice for you.

Tiger Woods, seeking to clinch the first FedEx Cup title, is among 20 golfers who will return today to finish their opening rounds at the Tour Championship in Atlanta after rain cut short play yesterday.
Tim Clark, who wasn't eligible for the tournament a week ago, beat the three-hour deluge to tie the course record at East Lake Golf Club with an 8-under-par 62. He has a one-shot lead over Padraig Harrington and is four ahead of Tiger Woods, who completed 11 holes.
After heavy rain soaked the course's greens, which are still recovering from damage caused by drought, Tiger Woods laughed when asked about their condition. The world's No. 1-ranked golfer, who led the FedEx Cup points list entering the final event, had five birdies and a bogey.
``The greens were interesting,'' he said. ``I hit them up there and they bounced all over the place and somehow went in.''
Of the other players who can win the FedEx Cup, Phil Mickelson, Rory Sabbatini, K.J Choi and Aaron Baddeley were 1- under after 12 holes, while Steve Stricker -- second in the points list -- was 1-over through 11. Just 10 golfers completed their rounds.
Clark earned a spot in the tournament, the final leg of the U.S. PGA Tour's FedEx Cup schedule, with a fifth-place finish at last week's BMW Championship near Chicago. Because he ranks 27th on the points list and isn't one of the six players able to win the FedEx Cup title, Clark said, he didn't practice.
``I didn't expect much,'' the 5-foot-7 Clark, a 31-year-old South African, said in a press conference. ``I've just sort of shown up and come to play. I guess it worked out.''
Tiger Woods birdied his first three holes, draining a putt from more than 30 feet to go to 3-under. He smiled and shrugged his shoulders after it fell in.
``It bounced to the right, I thought I missed it; it bounced to the left; I thought I missed it; then it bounced to the left, I thought I was going to miss it left, and then somehow it wiggled back to the right up the hill and it went in,'' the 31-year-old golfer said.
Tiger Woods, who won his 13th major title at last month's PGA Championship, followed a bogey at the fifth hole with birdies on the sixth and ninth holes. Adam Scott is tied with Tiger Woods at 4- under with five holes to play in his first round.
Harrington, the British Open champion, shot 6-under 29 over his final nine holes, including four consecutive birdies to finish the day. As he walked off the 18th green, the Irishman joked that he wanted to keep playing.
``Let's got to the first tee,'' he said to a group of spectators. ``It's always a good day when you can finish with four birdies.''
While Tiger Woods lamented the soft, bumpy greens, Harrington said they reminded him of the putting surfaces in Ireland after the winter months.
``I'm pretty familiar with them, especially at this pace,'' he said. ``If they were hard and fast and they were like that, it would be real tough. It would be a nightmare.''
John Rollins, among those to finish the opening 18 holes, and Mark Calcavecchia, who got through 16 holes, are tied for third at 6-under.

1) Arpeggios: tracks based on arpeggios (broken chords). Instruments used are arpeggiated analog synth’s, but also pizzicato strings, marimba and log drums. Tracks are open sounding, supporting, not distractive, great for documentaries and repp’s.
2) Cinematic Pads: tracks based on pads/drones, ideally suited for dramatic content. Tracks are bigger, fuller sounding than on the Arpeggios, but there are various underscore versions of most tracks, so you can easily switch between intensity/mood.
3) Piano Moods: a lot of solo piano tracks, but also a couple of pop oriented tracks (with underscores) and tracks layered with strings. Moods range from tranquil/serene, sad, to tension/suspence.
There are 10 new tracks on this CD, each with several underscore versions so you can edit them more easily. The main theme is vintage, so what can you expect? A lot of Fender Rhodes (see pic below), real analog synths, fat, funky basslines and guitars, punchy drums, uptempo tracks and a couple of downtempo funk-ballads. All the songs have underscore versions.

The UEC, a federal body reponsible for the management of clean and fair elections in Utania, has finalised the electoral boundaries that pave the way for political polling and the federal Parliamentary election to be held.
Fourty-one electorates, representing of between half-a-million to one-and-a-half-million citizens each, have been finalised after months of finalising a draft that satisfied all parties: the Parliamentary parties, the President and the UNV "Point South" Administration, which will continue to have a monitoring role alongside the UEC in the upcoming election. Between two and five MP's will be elected from each electorate, each MP representing about 300,000 citizens, by a system called "Multiple-Member Cut-off Proportional" (MMCP). The total number of MP's will be 137.
With the electorates finalised, the pressure is on the President to now make legal political polling, thus opening the final chapter of Utanian Democracy: the first free national election. The election will be called by the Prime Minister, but cannot be held any later than August 31st.
A more complete description of Utania's forthcoming election will be available in coming weeks. (c) 300ap, UPA.
Recently, I’ve been visiting local farms and nurseries to check out the how the locals have constructed their greenhouses and the creative ways in which they are heating and cooling them.
My first visit was to a lovely, little dwelling in Old Fort called Huckleberry Ridge Farm. The owners, Ken and Judy, have built a small greenhouse that they use to grow greens during the winter months. There is an infrared system that heats the dirt the on table beds where the greens grow. They supplement with a wood stove and small fan to circulate the warm air on cold winter nights which has substantially, lowered their heating bills. They’ve cleverly, placed bubble wrap on the inside of the roof covering for added insulation as well as insulating the backwall and using bagged leaves on the edges of the greenhouse. They’re always seeking more efficient ways to heat the space and to increase temperatures during winter to grow more food. A phase change material of 70 to 80 degrees F would be a perfect fit to store the heat for later use, for decreasing fossil fuel consumption and burning less wood.
Judy and Ken’s specialty is fine rabbit meat. They have beautiful, healthy rabbits which they process themselves at the farm, chickens for eggs, various greens and vegetables and lively ducks and geese that roam the property! I can attest that their rabbit meat is delicious and they’ve got the best tasting eggs we’ve had thus far!

DIASPORA Infrastructure Development Group (DIDG) has acquired a 50 percent stake of the country’s sole manufacturer of rail slippers Fort Concrete and will inject $3 million into the Gweru-based company to start manufacturing the slippers for the rail track rehabilitation project.
DIDG won the $400 million tender to recapitalise and operate the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) together with Transnet of South Africa.
DIDG executive chairman Mr Donovan Chimhandamba said the investment company has acquired half of the stake of Fort Concrete as part of its NRZ revitalisation strategy which includes rail track rehabilitation.
“This is part of the DIDG strategy. For us to be able to get NRZ up and running we need to capacitate the value chain industries that provide critical equipment and services to the parastatal, the NRZ project itself one of the key areas is track rehabilitation. On track rehabilitation the biggest component is the provision of slippers. So we went around in the region and we discovered that there was a company in Gweru which used to supply slippers to NRZ and the company is Fort Concrete.
The company was owned by Aveng Infraset. We are concluding a transaction where we will have 50 percent stake in the company.
Our intention is to get the railway slipper manufacturing plant up and running ahead of the track rehabilitation programme we have with the RBZ,” he said.
Mr Chimhandamba said the company intends to set up a new and modern plant at Fort Concrete and increasing its production capacity to about 880 slippers a day.
“We are looking at spending more than $3 million on the plant revitalisation exercise. We are bringing in new equipment. We are bringing in a batch mixing plant because the one which is there is obsolete. We are going to bring in modernised equipment.
As we speak we are producing 300 slippers a day. We have an order of 10 000 slippers from NRZ. But for the track rehabilitation project, we need about one million slippers,” he said.
The revival of Fort Concrete, which also produces concrete material for the construction of roads, bridges dams, will have far reaching implications on the construction industry as well as the Southern African Region in terms of rail network.
The company was handed over to the employees by the owners, Aveng Infraset, 10 years ago after business dwindled due to economic challenges. Fort Concrete used to employ 160 people but has since downsized its workforce to about 30.
As a small community nonprofit, volunteers are an integral part of meeting our mission, and we deeply value the passion and energy that each of our volunteers brings to AAMB. We could not do it without our volunteers. WITHOUT U THERE IS NO U-S!
There are always opportunities for new volunteers to join AAMB in our mission to inspire and educate all on the history, arts, and culture of Africans and African-Americans. There are a number of ways that you can volunteer to help us as we strongly believe everyone has strengths and skills that can benefit others.
We offer internships and student volunteer opportunities for those in school as well as a flexible volunteer schedule for adults who want to make a difference.

Scientists, engineers, and analysts are confronted with ever larger and more complex sets of data, whose analysis poses special challenges. In many situations it is necessary to compare two or more datasets. Hence there is a need for comparative visualization tools to help analyze differences or similarities among datasets. In this paper an approach for comparative visualization for sets of images is presented. Well-established techniques for comparing images frequently place them side-by-side. A major drawback of such approaches is that they do not scale well. Other image comparison methods encode differences in images by abstract parameters like color. In this case information about the underlying image data gets lost. This paper introduces a new method for visualizing differences and similarities in large sets of images which preserves contextual information, but also allows the detailed analysis of subtle variations. Our approach identifies local changes and applies cluster analysis techniques to embed them in a hierarchy. The results of this process are then presented in an interactive web application which allows users to rapidly explore the space of differences and drill-down on particular features. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying it to multiple distinct domains.

Molecular simulations and modelling means altering the science of enzymology. Computational enzymology is a rapidly developing area, and is studying the theories of catalysis, challenging 'textbook' mechanisms, and also identifying the novel catalytic mechanisms. Also increasingly, modelling is contributing directly towards the experimental studies of the enzyme-catalysed reactions. Potential practical applications in this area include interpretation of the experimental datas, catalyst design and also drug development.

Ed Summers of Estero and Bob Williams and Mike McMillan of Fort Myers Beach meet up on Wednesdays as The Pearl Street Band to jam out to a few of their favorite songs at Truly Scrumptious in Santini Plaza.
Bill Veach, left, is the unofficial fourth member of the band and often appears as their special guest to collaborate. Veach plays guitar and cajon.
While the ice cream shop is usually closed for dinner, Wednesdays are an exception. The band gets meal and the customers get free live entertainment for the once-a-week dinner special.
And the Pearl Street men don't have trouble filling the diner with friends, family and fans. They even have a set of regular listeners.
But once the three men - and usually a special guest musician - pick up their instruments to play a tune, it's clear why they attract their own fan base.
Claiming "Americana" as their genre, the Pearl Street Band strums to blues and ballads thrown in with a little island-folksy stint.
"They always mix in a different artist with their core group," Chuck said. "And it's a nice mix of covers and originals."
The three "core" members would often play together in the area. Then, they were asked if their band could perform at a local fundraiser.
Listeners aren't going to hear the same portfolio as other places on the island, said Williams, one of the band's guitar players. Williams and McMillan are both songwriters; Summers, the base player, is happy to strum along to their tunes.
The three men also try to collaborate with other local artists in their style, each week featuring a guest. The band, and the special guest, often practice on Tuesday before playing to the public at Truly Scrumptious.
"We're not an open mic, but we're open to collaboration with some practice," Williams said. "When a guest comes in to play, we have to figure out on the fly how to work with them while they play their own material."
Bill Veach, another island resident, is an unofficial fourth band member and frequent special guest. A songwriter himself, Veach also plays guitar and a cajon drum, adding some percussion into the strings band.
"I was a long-haired rock and roll drummer in high school," Veach said. "I played guitar for a while and re-entered playing when I retired."
Collaboration and expanded opportunity doesn't end of Fort Myers Beach: the four men are all members of the Americana Community Music Association, an organization based in Fort Myers that draws together singer-songwriters from the southwest Florida area together to collaborate and grow together. The website defines Americana as a contemporary music genre incorporating various American styles, including country, roots-rock, folk, bluegrass, blues and R&B. The organization hosts about 60 events a year, including a weekly show held Saturdays at its main rented venue, the All Faiths Unitarian Congregation at 2756 McGregor Blvd., Fort Myers.
"We have under-the-wire, not famous yet, musicians touring with a local opener," Williams said. "There's an emphasis on original music."
Veach said playing for the ACMA was some of his first experiences playing his own music in front of an audience with the guitar. When he used to play drums, he was hidden in the back. Adding the fact that at the ACMA, he's playing in front of other songwriters, he used to get nervous.
Williams said he and the other band members encouraged Veach to keep trying it out, because the group is very relaxed and not intimidating.
The ACMA holds events elsewhere in the county as well; some of its members, including the Pearl Street Band, will be participating in the Lovers Key Songwriters at Sunset, held in the beach gazebo Thursday, Jan. 4, beginning at 4:15 pm. A barbeque will be held before.
McMillan, Williams and Veach all write original content and they all have a different way of going about it. Williams and Veach often think of the lyrics before thinking of the music, but Veach said he'll sometimes re-write a whole song because he found a sound he liked.
McMillan is opposite: usually, the tune comes to him first, long before the words settle in. The words have to have a connection to the music, he said.

What Matters at the Election Finish Line—Sunday Political Brunch - November 4, 2018—What Matters at the Election Finish Line --…
Weiss: Midterm Elections are Here - Your Vote Sends a Message to Congress—Weiss: Midterm Elections are Here - Your Vote…
This week Jews around the world celebrate the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashanah marking the beginning of the year 5777. As a traditional new year’s greeting we wish each other L’shana tova, or may you have a year full of goodness. We don’t wish each other a happy new year but rather wish for a good year. With all the turmoil and mishegas (craziness) in the world around us it seems like an important time to consider the difference.
In one of his most memorable Rosh Hashanah sermons, my friend and now retired, Rabbi Les Gutterman indelibly seared into my brain the literal translation of L’shana tova and the distinction between happiness and goodness. He posed a very interesting question to the congregation which has stayed with me over the years. “What if our founding fathers had proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence that our inalienable rights included life, liberty, and the pursuit of goodness instead of the pursuit of happiness? Would we be better off if we valued goodness above happiness? Rabbi Gutterman’s questions always make me think and this one was no different. I have been pondering his question and the difference between happiness and goodness ever since.
It seems to me that happiness is a state of mind and goodness is more of a state of being. Happiness is more inwardly focused and transient while goodness is more outwardly focused and a value or character trait that doesn’t come and go. I started listing words that come to mind for both happiness and goodness.
Happiness is more individually focused. What will make me happy? How can I make you happy? While not always the case happiness tends to be about receiving rather than giving. Goodness is more community focused. What will be most helpful to others? What charitable act or kindness can I provide to a neighbor or someone less fortunate in the community? To see the goodness in someone is to see one’s essence and strength.
Nothing against the pursuit of happiness but if it were possible to amend the Declaration of Independence I would advocate for asserting our inalienable rights for life, liberty, and the pursuit of goodness.
If our society was based more on the value of goodness than individual happiness I think we would make more progress on the big societal issues of our time. We would treat each other with more respect and civility. We would make more progress in transforming important social systems including our health care, education and government systems. We would take our environmental stewardship responsibility more seriously. We would work even harder with a generosity of spirit to leave behind a better world for future generations.
Here’s to the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of goodness. L’shana tova. May you have a year full of goodness.

If your blog has received a threatening letter from Adaptive Affinity please leave details in the comments section below.
In 2007 I bought some business cards from Vistaprint. After that purchase clubprem.com and highstreetmax.com started taking money from my visa without my knowledge. Highstreetmax.com and clubprem.com are both owned by Adaptive Affinity. The total amount taken was ?252.05. I did some digging on the internet and published my findings in this post http://www.hubbers.com/index.php/i-got-scammed-by-vistaprint-and-adaptive-marketing-and-adaptive-affinity-ltd-and-amazon/.
Well it turns out the honest people at Adaptive Affinity don’t like my blog post so they have threatened me in a nameless and unspecific way. what’s more they have threatened other bloggers with similar letters!
We are writing on behalf of Adaptive Affinity Ltd and refer to the webpage listed above. This web page contains a number of allegations regarding Adaptive Affinity and its partners that are inaccurate and defamatory in nature. It is our view the contents of the blog is causing and could continue to cause
serious reputational harm, not only to Adaptive Affinity, but other organisations to which it also refers.
The accusations made on this web page are simply untrue and no proof is offered to validate these claims. Here is a sample list of false and/or inaccurate statements made on this web page which warrant its immediate removal:
1. I did some further investigation…and found that the internet servers hosting http://www.clubprem.com/ and http://www.highstreetmax.com also hosts all of these dodgy websites also owned by Adaptive Marketing.
2. Strangely the call centre that I got through to in Jamaica were more than happy to refund all of my money in less than a week. (Adaptive Affinity?s call centre is in the UK and not in Jamaica).
3. Basically they steal as much money as possible and refund the people who kick up a fuss. I imagine most people ask for a refund at the end.
4. The following domains have been added since I wrote this post in September which means that the scam is alive and well.
These are but a few of the statements that have been made and there are many more on the page that are offensive.
The language used on the page, both by you and comments left by third parties is unacceptable and suggest to the ordinary user that the practices of Adaptive Affinity are unethical or at worst illegal. The entire web page in itself is an unfair attack on Adaptive Affinity and its partners. These are legitimate businesses with legitimate business practices.
Although the burden of proof lies with you to prove the truth in these statements made, as proof to you (and not for publication elsewhere) that Adaptive Affinity is a legitimate business we can confirm that less than
one half a percent of the millions of consumers marketed to and the many thousands of members enrolled in Adaptive Affinity?s membership programs complain about their memberships.
Adaptive Affinity has always followed high standards of responsible corporate practice. We regularly undertake quality controls to ensure our respective business practices comply with or exceed industry standards and applicable law. These practices extend throughout the organisation. We rebut the assertions made in this Blog and accordingly we request that it is removed with immediate effect.
As the primary publisher and the person who exercises direct editorial control over what is published we would like to point out that you are responsible for all the posting on your site. This matter can still be resolved without incident if you act very quickly to our satisfaction now. However, if you fail to do so, we reserve all our legal rights and remedies in respect of this matter. We also reserve all our rights and remedies (in respect of all relevant posts) if you are involved with any other posts about us or if there is any other publication made as a result of your posts.
Please respond to this letter by return and in any event within 7 days of the date on which it is sent with full details of the actions and the timeframe you will be taking to urgently rectify this matter. Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated.
Adaptive Affinity have also sent the same letter to my web host in the hope that they will stop hosting my site.
I am currently reducing clutter around my flat by selling my old DVDs and books on Amazon’s marketplace. Today I sold ‘Die another Day’ for 13p. Normally this works out to be marginally profitable as Amazon give you more for postage that items cost to post. But on this particular item Amazon charged almost all of the sale price and the postage as commission. The breakdown is as follows:
Individuals selling at Marketplace pay a GBP 0.86 per item completion fee, plus a closing fee of 17.25% of the sales price (11.5% for Electronics & Photo items) for each item sold.
Which seems steep and it makes it unprofitable to sell (or buy) really cheap DVDs or books on Amazon. This is a real shame because in the past I have bought a few 1p (plus postage) books from Amazon.
The postage for this DVD would cost 66p so I have cancelled the order and now the DVD is going to one of the charity shops on Finchley Road which is a much better idea. I guess in this way Amazon are doing a good thing. By making it unprofitable to sell the nickel and dime stuff they make it much more likely that old books etc end up in charity Shops.
A friend helped me get my blog post brought to the attention of the New Zealand Herald. They ran this story titled Fans put hard word on NZRU over agent’s ticket charges on the day of the final autumn international against England.
The thing that got me about the article is that when Ms Faisandier from STIL was asked where all the money went she couldn’t say.
She told me on email that it was “about 50/50”. Strange she wasn’t prepared to make the same claim to a national newspaper.
The other thing that struck me was that when NZRU were asked they didn’t have a clue either! I wish we could all run our businesses in such a haphazard manner where letting millions of dollars of potential revenue slip through our fingers wasn’t such a big issue.
NZRU commercial manager Paul Dalton said he could not say what percentage of the money gained by STIL came back to the rugby union.
This quote astounded me because the Herald also had this story where they indicate that the NZRU financial situation isn’t that strong at the moment.
The NZRU is on track to post a small profit this year, a much improved situation from the one predicted six months ago.
You’d think that if they were that broke they’d be wondering if they could have had some of the millions of dollars that have been added to All Black tickets in the UK over the last few years.
This is so true. Gordon Brown got into government in 1997 on the promise that he would bring an end to destructive booms and busts in the property market.
Eleven years as Chancellor (the money guy) and Prime Minister later he has presided over the biggest boom of them all. And now the evidence of his initial bold claims is starting to disappear from government websites. Shameful.
If your tickets have been marked up by STIL please leave the details in the comments section at the bottom of this post.
Earlier this year Grant, Cam, Russ and I purchased tickets to the Ireland, Wales and England rugby tests against the All Black in the UK this November.
The purchase was made through Sports Tickets International Limited who are, according to their site, the Officially Licensed Match Ticket Company of the New Zealand Rugby Union (“NZRU”).
The total amount that my Visa was charged was 922.85 but when I picked up my tickets yesterday the face value of all 12 tickets came to a meagre ?632. This means that STIL added on a whopping 46% to the price of the tickets!
STIL have added a handling fee to the face value of each ticket. This fee covers the cost of making this facility available (including website and software charges, travel, administration, wages and processing fees), and as a result the face value of the tickets will not equate with the amount charged. Any income, which remains at the end of this project, once all costs have been paid, will be returned to the NZRU to assist with the development of Rugby in New Zealand.
I have copied and pasted the below from the Terms & Conditions Page on the STIL website, hope this helps.
If we assume that our tickets are the average price then STIL is making roughly ?25 per ticket. If we also assume that they have 5000 tickets per game to sell then they will have 25000 tickets which means that they will take ?625,000 or 1,766,519 New Zealand Dollars (today’s exchange rate is 2.826) to perform the duties mentioned above.
I have emailed them again and asked them how much money is returned to NZRU for the development of NZ rugby.
So NZRU get nearly ONE MILLION NEW ZEALAND DOLLARS for the development of NZ rugby which is good. And it costs STIL nearly ONE MILLION NEW ZEALAND DOLLARS to sell Kiwis in the UK tickets to 5 games of rugby.
So you are saying that it costs nearly one million New Zealand dollars to provide tickets for New Zealand fans for 5 games of rugby?
I am not sure where you are getting your figures from and where you are going with this, but we will not be following any further line of communication.
If you like, we will take you off our database, and recommend you purchase your tickets direct from the host unions in future.
You know what I am getting at Margaret Faisandier, you are profiteering from loyal All Black fans!!!
Out of respect for the loyal fans and for the good of rugby in New Zealand in the future I recommend NZRU take the following actions:
1. NZRU should have a regular (two yearly?) and transparent tender process for the job of selling UK tour tickets to New Zealanders in Europe. This will minimise the cost and maximise any revenue for NZRU.
2. NZRU should make a clear statement about what percentage is to be added to the tickets and how much of that money goes to the development of New Zealand rugby. I am sure that most Kiwi fans won’t mind contributing to the ABs via their tickets especially given the economic pressures NZ faces from European teams. The key thing is that NZRU should be open and honest about it so that the fans don’t feel scammed or ripped off.
A friend of a friend (NZ is a small country) helped me get this issue brought to the attention of New Zealand’s biggest daily newspaper. They ran this story titled Fans put hard word on NZRU over agent’s ticket charges on the eve of the All Black match against England at Twickenham.
It’ll be interesting to see what happens from here. NZRU clearly don’t know what is going on in their own back yard and millions of dollars have been wasted over the last few years leaving fans feeling bitter and ripped off (see the comments below). What will NZRU do?
My friend from university got two England v All Blacks tickets for Twickenham from STIL Rugby and he paid ?100 for each.
When the tickets arrived they had a face value of ?50 each and they were in the worst part of the stadium!
All Blacks autumn international tickets have gone on sale through STIL. The cheapest tickets available to the worst seats at Twickenham were roughly &#pound;100 meaning that STIL are still adding a 100% markup to All Black tickets. The STIL website terms and conditions now says this:
But there still isn’t any indication as to how much of the hundreds of thousands of dollars added to All Black tickets by STIL are returned to the NZRU to assist with the development of Rugby in New Zealand.
I have set up an online petition stating that Amazon should stop circulating advertising material for VistaPrint. Hopefully if we get enough signatures Amazon will stop doing business with these scammers and we will get them where it hurts the most – their bank account!
If you have been scammed by VistaPrint please include details of how much money they took from you in the comments section at the bottom of this post.

Last Friday I had the honour of being best man at my Kiwi mate Bundy’s wedding to an English girl called Laura Clark. As part of my duties I had to read the telegrams from people who couldn’t make the wedding. One of them included this cracker paragraph referring to the current very unpopular New Zealand Prime Minister, Helen Clark:
First off, my apologies that I couldn’t make it up there to talk you out of it. You see, Helen Clarke likes my money. So you can blame her for my lack of funds, and the need to bypass time off so I can work even harder to get my own share of the pie. Vote National.
You know people are really feeling it when they start giving voting advice in telegrams to be read on the other side of the planet.
What was even funnier was that the bride’s mum’s first name is Helen (for her last name see above). The Kiwis in the crowd were pissing themselves.
On Sunday we spent 8 hours on England’s wonderful railway service (making a journey that should have been 3 hours) to Monkey World in Dorset. Monkey World is sanctuary for monkeys that are saved from all over the planet. Some were kept in research labs for in one meter cages by themselves for year after for year. Others were pets that got too big to be pets any more.
Finally on the Monday off work we took our bike out to the country and covered them in mud. My bike the Canondale “Road Warrior” did okay in the muddy conditions despite it’s skinny road wheels.
Half way through the day the front tire split and I got two consecutive punctures which I fixed while everyone else was enjoying their lunches.
This is a photo from McDonalds’ special Rugby World Cup menu. I would suggest adding the following menu items. A low calorie bag of hot air for Australia. A very blunt instrument (probably a spoon) for South Africa. Something bland and disappointing for England. A bag of sour grapes for Stephen Jones to eat. A doormat for France after their first performance. And nothing dangerous that the Kiwis might choke on.
We touched down in Marseilles to the amazing news that Argentina had convincingly beaten the hosts France in the opening match. This is shocking news as the team that comes second in the so called pool of death will head to Cardiff to face the All Blacks. France ideally wanted to delay this encounter until Paris for the final where they would have had home ground advantage. Now they are playing for their lives and have to beat Ireland just to have a chance to progress out of the pool.
It took us a couple of hours to clear customs and clear up the booking mess made by our Etap hotel after they gave out rooms out to anyone and everyone who asked for them before we arrived. Thankfully we asked for a room from another couple and all was sorted out.
By the time we caught up with Russ, Russ, Cam and Phil who took an earlier flight they were well smashed. I took a great video of Phil ripping of a locked drinks fridge. There was little chance of getting caught as the French bar owners were drowning their sorrows.
Up at 11 the next day the nine of us decided to walk to the game as it was a very sunny day. Stopped for a beer on the way. When we got to the stadium we settled in and Cam spent forty euros on alcohol free beer for everyone. That was nice of him.
The Italians made an early mistake by ignoring the Haka. The snub must have really ticked off the All Blacks because it only took them 68 seconds to score their first try. Eighty minutes later the Italians had let in 10 more tries and the All Blacks took the game 64 – 14. Allowing the Italians one intercept try and another late one off a poorly judged kick in our own 22. The intercept was the worrying one as it was an intercept by Australia that put us out of the last world cup and we seem to give one away every game these days.
After the game we had a couple of beers (with alcohol) and a meal for the first court session. After only 24 hours on tour we had enough fines to finish off a bottle of Lemoncini between the 9 of us.
An all night drinking session followed. Later on in the evening we even met Brad Butterworth OBE the Kiwi yachtsman who won us the Americas cup and then went to work for another syndicate and won it back off us. It didn’t make him very popular at home. He was very approachable and seemed like a good guy.
I went home around one or two and managed to dislocate my thumb on the way. Luckily it popped straight back in. Some of the boys who got in around five were warned by friendly locals that they were drinking with that it was too dangerous for them to stay out. Apparently some of the other locals were looking for a fight with Kiwis and it was no longer safe to be out in Marseilles. We woke the next day to find out that three of our group had been pick-pocketed for mobiles or wallets (although one may have had that done by the local guy she was kissing). Someone also saw a guy on a scooter try to steal a handbag off the passenger seat of a parked car. Marseilles is a nice town but it seems you have to be pretty vigilant or the locals will rob you blind.
On Sunday we had a relaxed start and the boys had a topless swim (when in Rome) with the locals at one of the beaches.
In other rugby news. A lot of the minnow teams made their major league counterparts look decidedly average. Samoa were only down 9-7 after 30 minutes. Ireland barely subdued Namibia 32-17. America made England work for every point of their 28-10 victory. And Canada led Wales 17-9 after 45 minutes.
I recently had a package shipped form the USA with DHL. On arrival there was an outstanding charge for VAT of ?1.25 which DHL set about collecting, along with their ?12.22 administration fee!
The only other valuable skill I had was dealing with spreadsheets. After getting my first spreadsheet job (9 interviews), I picked up a VBA manual on my bosses desk and read it through. I then ended up picking up more and more technology skills and ended up as a software engineer. Partially, the passion came from the fact that you could model mathematical reasoning so well in programming, which was a pleasant surprise (esp given I’d never programmed).
It’s not just working hard, although that was a part of it. I was trying to make the best of every opportunity that came by, and I think a lot of people ignore those opportunities because they’re scared of change or unwilling to open their mind and take on another job that might not seem so interesting or great, but ends up being your dream career.
Wow, these salaries and success stories are amazing, and making me wonder what I did wrong. I earned my BS in Computer Science in 1986. Now, after an MBA and an MS Risk Management, two lay offs, a few missed/blown opportunities, and the Great Recession, my 2013 annual salary is exactly the same as 1999 – well under $100K, in a mid-sized, mid-cost, coastal FL city.
I am a highschool student with some questions. First of all I wanted to know the importance of volunteer work for getting into a high end school (I currently have straight A’s as well.) Second are AP classes beneficial even if a college I would like to go to doesn’t accept them. And lastly I am interested in being a Petroleum Engineer so any info you have on that field of work would be cool. Great article by the way!
Thanks for sharing. Parents will definitely find your info helpful! We agree with you on public universities. My wife and I went to city universities and both of us majored in Computer Science in the early 80’s. My wife is the smarter one and she went to college for free. My parents paid 6K for my 4.5 years. It around $450 per semester back then. I think we got a great education. I can’t imagine parents paying over 50K plus per year these days.
Households may also be differentiated among each other, depending on whether or not they have one or multiple income earners (the high female participation in the economy means that many households have two working members[15]). For example, in 2005 the median household income for a two income earner households was $67,000 while the median income for an individual employed full-time with a graduate degree was in excess of $60,000, demonstrating that nearly half of individuals with a graduate degree have higher earnings than most dual income households.[8]
I think this post is totally on point. Starting from high school, you are paving the path. I also think choosing the right career is key. I have been a court reporter for 18 years, and my best year I made 270k, and in my worst year, I made 160k. Even with taking time off to have a baby, last year I still made 140k. I also think it’s true you have to hustle. I have recommended becoming a court reporter o so many people! But none of them have wanted to put in the effort to train and work their butts off. I turned 40 this year and also became a millionaire. Greatest feeling! And I didn’t have to sleep with someone not as good looking as me, LOL! Love your posts. Keep up the good work.
The latest annual inflation rate is 1.3 percent. It was 1.5 percent in 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s well below average, but gas, food prices, college tuition and the cost of health care have taken the biggest bites out of six-figure incomes. The latter two, plus the cost of housing, have risen faster than the rate of inflation over the past decade.
The only thing I will counter with is that there must be at least some interest in the field or grades and job performance will suffer. For my kids, who will be in college after we’ve all been hooked to the Matrix (unless we already have?) in 20 years, I’m going to highly recommend double majoring: one passion major and one practical. Double majors really are a great value and not always that time consuming if you’ve already eliminated pre reqs with APs.
I went through the entire training after which I started wondering, “Is this how to make 39,041.46 consistently every month?” Maybe it is or maybe not, depending on how you want to look at it. If you’d like to consistently make $39,041.46 per month in your dreams, I think it’s entirely possible. But if not, I seriously doubt it because of what contents the training is made of.
It seems that people are slightly repelled from sales pages since the experience imposes a decision making at a speed not of their choosing i.e. they are aware of the funnel and quite frankly suspicious of being manipulated (this is where trust building kicks in, but sometimes just…). For that reason, using editing techniques and somewhat less obvious copywriting techniques can make a huge difference. Give the full disclosure that you are selling, sure, but make it so that the reader is in a different mindset. I for one like to make the sale page looking like any other article on the site. Magazine style articles, with pictures, opinions, personal experience, advice… When my style of expression and writing feels as dispersed through the article as it is through any other segment of my site, I know that the page would appeal more to visitors.
and finally, it is possible to find someone who is genuinely earning that high. They tell the truth when asked how to do it? that it requires intensity, focus, education/training/learning, stating power to not let hurdles stop you, know your market and all of your competition intimately.They had money to start with from a family member, giving them the chance to get set up to do all of th items listed above. They almost always have 1 close partner that works right beside them to collaborate with.
Here’s how Amazon Associates works. People Googled “gifts for writers,” then clicked on the ideas we shared in our post, which took them over to Amazon.com. Regardless of whether they bought that item we recommended, they then continued to do their holiday shopping, stocking up on all sorts of random gifts, from electronics to clothing to books. And because they clicked on our link initially, we earned somewhere between four to 10 percent of whatever they spent on Amazon during the next 24 hours.
The income disparities within the top 1.5% are quite drastic.[44] While households in the top 1.5% of households had incomes exceeding $250,000, 443% above the national median, their incomes were still 2200% lower than those of the top 0.1% of households. One can therefore conclude that almost any household, even those with incomes of $250,000 annually, are poor when compared to the top 0.01%, who in turn are poor compared to the top 0.000267%, the top 400 taxpaying households.[original research?]
Based on the marketing, you earn 100% commissions on sales and on upsells. The promotion throughout the site makes these products sound like sure-fire winners, especially as Michael Cheney has already made a lot from them. That's not a bad commission rate! Seriously, I love when companies pay high commissions, but you have to promote good products if you want to keep those commissions and avoid refunds.
… ensure that long, multi-topic pages on your site are well-structured and broken into distinct logical sections. Second, ensure that each section has an associated anchor with a descriptive name (i.e., not just “Section 2.1”), and that your page includes a “table of contents” which links to the individual anchors… you won’t see it on the results all the time — only when we think that a link to a section would be highly useful for a particular query.
Long-Tail Keywords – specific keywords usually with 3-7 individual words in a phrase. They are highly targeted and MUCH easier to rank for than broad keywords (all mine are long-tail). The lower your domain authority (check using OSE), the less competitive (more long-tail) your keywords should be. If you can get more specific and the keyword still shows up in Google Autocomplete, Moz Keyword Explorer and other keyword tools… choose the SPECIFIC one.
But I have a question… Do you really think that those who don’t attend the top schools won’t be as successful? (Coming from someone who doesn’t go to Colombia or UCD) What are your thoughts? Should they transfer from a cal state to a UC? Or should they complete their bachelors in a cal state and then proceed to get their MBA in a higher ranked university?
First, I’m still going to school, so haven’t started earning at my full potential yet. Second, I’m hoping to (at least eventually) have a job as college professor, so my work income will be roughly $65,000 (as you’ve mentioned in past posts), and so I’ll need to build alternative income sources to close the gap. That’s my story, and I’m sticking to it.
I would counter and say not to get a petroleum engineering degree but rather a mechanical or chemical degree and find a job in the O&G industry. Petroleum degrees limit you to a specific industry and from what I’ve heard (I’m in the industry) many companies are now leaning towards those with mechanical or chemical degrees over the once popular petroleum degrees. Further when the industry hits a down turn like we’re currently in, those with the more general engineering degree will have a better shot at finding work in other industries.
Not that I recommend this as a permanent lifestyle, especially if you want to have kids some day, but you could always take one of those “Most Dangerous Jobs” as an oil platform worker, Alaska crabber, etc. which pay well, or even get into a decent skilled job in a manufacturing facility with a base of say, 50-60K after a few years, but work every shift of overtime you can get your hands on. Granted, I used to see many people miserable doing this, but they were bringing in 6 figures as a mechanic, pipefitter or in some cases, even HS level line workers. Finally, you can get a side job – like blogging!
I am starting a new job soon (30/m/renter/$12,000 IRA) but importantly, no debt. $56000/year with a 5% 401k Match. I am having trouble determining whether I want to go all in on the 401k and forgo the ROTH IRA. Or go partial in on the 401k ($10,000/year) + max ROTH IRA. After all, the after income-tax dollars are going to be in the second lowest braced (15%).
Income is commonly used to measure affluence, although this is a relative indicator: a middle class person with a personal income of $77,500 annually and a billionaire may both be referred to as affluent, depending on reference groups. An average American with a median income of $32,000[7] ($39,000 for those employed full-time between the ages of 25 and 64)[8] when used as a reference group would justify the personal income in the tenth percentile of $77,500 being described as affluent,[7] but if this earner were compared to an executive of a Fortune 500 company, then the description would not apply.[9][10] Accordingly, marketing firms and investment houses classify those with household incomes exceeding $250,000 as mass affluent, while the threshold upper class is most commonly defined as the top 1% with household incomes commonly exceeding $525,000 annually.
The GI Bill works exactly as it is intended. I’ve used both the Montgomery and the Post 9/11 as I served during the transition and participated in both. There is always a 4-6 month delay to get started. It’s because the VA is very slow to get things moving. You can apply as soon as you get accepted in most cases which for me was several months before I got out of the service. The program is not a fraud because of the red tape. Could it be better? Of course! But it’s not a fraud because it doesn’t pay you right away.
Great article, thanks. My question is slightly off the affiliate topic. I am curious about how Authorship will effect people running blogs on different topics.I run a marketing creative firm and want to start moving into information product sales, but I want to be able to write about our firm expertise (membership marketing) as well as try out products and blogging for people who want to start creative firms. How will people who want to write on unrelated areas manage things like G+ profiles as Aurthorship and authority become bigger deals? Do you think it will be a problem in Google to have the same author writing about different topics?
My conversion rate went from 2.5% to 8% just by including Facebook polls where SiteGround was rated #1 (here’s last year’s poll) plus Twitter screenshots and Facebook conversations. Whether it’s Amazon reviews or social proof, you NEED to include outside opinions. You can also use WP Rich Snippets to allow people to leave a review about the product/service on your site and get those review stars in Google (you will want to use their front end submit add-on).
Hey Camron. The only way to achieve those figures is to build your own business and become your own boss. It takes hard work and dedication, and it ALWAYS takes money to make money on some level. If you want to make a million dollars, you best believe there are start up costs. The key is to find the right opportunity, with a low start up cost, and an IMMENSE support system in place. You need to find Mentors who have already achieved what you want to achieve and emulate their daily actions and habits.
Anyway, back to this program called the Seven Figure Franchise. There have been many affiliate programs that have come and gone over the years promising all sorts of wealth and prosparity. Now don’t get me wrong, I do believe that people make money with affiliate marketing, but like some of the people her have mentioned, you have to do it in the right way.

p.s the mechanics of this particularly industry is old hat for me, and historically I’ve built multiple 7 figure net profit businesses using old tech like ‘telesales. I’m interested in SEO because I just think that cold calling and interrupting people is just inefficient and SEO sounds/feels like a really good way of giving people the information that they are searching for without bugging the s&1t out of them.
I’ve indeed ignored the very significant factor of personal satisfaction of the job and have just focused on the financial aspects. This is something I constantly struggle with myself…how much value am I really providing to the world by helping some oil company increase profits? On the other hand, I can rationalize that the world needs energy, and engineers help find it.

I could not disagree more with the title of this post. Six figures does absolutely mean something, as long as you don’t make poor financial decisions. You chose to buy all that crap, the worst decision being to buy that expensive house. I am 29, make six figures, and live comfortably. The reason why is because I was able to increase my income while keeping my expenses down. It’s really that simple. Of course, everyone’s life situation is different and normally expenses go up the older you get. My point is that Six figures does mean something as long as you are fiscally responsible. The title of this should be more along the lines of “dumb decisions I made once I started making six figures”.
Having that level of job security must feel great and re-assuring. When I visit other personal finance forums (particularly on reddit) half of the success stories seem to come from computer science majors. It might be the perfect blend of degree value, job availability, and work levels/flexibility. The ability to freelance or work remotely seems to be another potential benefit.

The top programs for petroleum engineering are offered by public universities, notably The University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M, Louisiana State University, and Colorado School of Mines.  Much of the value of a PE degree comes from being able to obtain the best education on the market from public schools like these rather than obscenely priced private schools.
But if you want to make money – there are things to do besides be an engineer and having been one of those that did a bachelors, medical degree and post doc before I ever had a real job – worked fine even with the loans. I was the first in my family to acheive a graduate degree, paid for it with loans, but my niche career choice I found out about during my pathology traing way down the line worked out.
There are a limited number of scholarships available for flight students but I wouldn’t count on those; competition is fierce and there are very few awarded. Anyone starting now and taking the civilian path to a flying job needs to be prepared to make a hefty initial investment. There’s really no getting around that, but as you said there loans are certainly an option. Also, for those with prior military service, the GI Bill can be used for flight training. Hope this helps.
I believe for many people including myself, the elusive passion that yields happiness and fulfillment is still unknown even well into adulthood. Personally, if money wasn’t a factor I’m not sure what I would be doing…and that’s what I’d like to figure out. In the meanwhile though, building financial independence can provide options down the road and keep you flexible.
If you lack the time to read the details of the review, here’s the short version: Michael Cheney’s Commission Black Ops isn’t as the sales page claims. Your chances of making $1000 per day with it are very slim. You’ll discover that there’s really nothing exceptionally revealing or new about it. Some of the information in it are actually stuff you can get for free on the Internet. I provided proof for all these within the main body of the review below.
Hi, thanks for another awesome article. I understand EVERYTHING on this subject but what’s the best course of action when your website is lacking a tight focus? My site is based around the concept of stop doing the things you hate and start doing what you really want. Which started out with ‘how to quit your job’ but I thought that was too limiting so now it now covers all aspects of lifestyle, interacting with others, thoughts on life and health & fitness.

Interesting and motivating article. I didn’t take high school very seriously, and I only took my last 3 years of my 4.5 years of college with strong intentions to succeed. I got my GPA back up to a 3.33 from a 2.76 and landed two summer internships with Fortune 500 companies during school. I now work at one of those said companies and will gross just north of 85k after base salary, relocation, and sign-on bonus (also, could be closer to 88-90k depending on my performance bonus).
Want to earn a six-figure salary? Choose your next career path carefully, and get ready to make a serious investment in education. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook, only 55 out of 818 listed occupations offer median salaries of $100,000 per year or more—and 53 of them typically require at least a bachelor’s degree.
The most important lesson I got from the book is the importance of choosing a niche; it helps build a loyal community, get expertise and great, contextualized advertising. However, except for the generic "start by identifying your own interests, passions, and energy levels for topics", there's not a lot of direction about how to choose a profitable niche. There also isn't much about search engine optimization (which I fortunately covered in another book) or about keyword research. However, a lot of the things that Rowse and Garrett hold important (niching, ads, etc) aren't necessarily the be-all and end-all of popular blogging.
Nicely written and so helpful info. Having too much advertisement in a site is so painful for visitor cause it makes the site look cheaper. Instead, If one can limit the number of one’s advertisement and have some affiliation it would be way cool and wouldn’t be so harsh for the visitors . You have shared some significant point for affiliate marketing . Thanks for sharing
I could talk about unions forever, Alice! I didn’t in this post because I didn’t want to get too lost in the weeds for people who aren’t part of the profession. My parents are both retired union workers, and I will be part of a union for as long as I can be. Sadly, the right-to-work nonsense is rubbing off, and we just got a letter from our union saying that it is now optional to be part of a union. I have to be honest and say that teachers’ unions (at least in our area) aren’t what they used to be. But as long as I can, I will fight for mine. So glad you spoke up, Alice! Your building is lucky to have you!
In the old days of SEO you’d build backlinks using relevant anchor text. So, for example, if you wanted to rank for “bonsai trees” that would be the link text you’d use in your guest posts. And then the Panda update happened and Google took a swipe at unnatural link profiles which meant that SEOs started making their anchor text more natural (things like “click here to read the rest”).
The typical middle-class household in the United States is no longer a one-earner family, with one parent in the workforce and one at home full-time. Instead, the majority of families with small children now have both parents rising at dawn to commute to jobs so they can both pull in paychecks... Today the median income for a fully employed male is $41,670 per year (all numbers are inflation-adjusted to 2004 dollars)—nearly $800 less than his counterpart of a generation ago. The only real increase in wages for a family has come from the second paycheck earned by a working mother. – Elizabeth Warren, Harvard Magazine.[15]
If you have an inclination to chemistry, biology, can present your science well and work well across line functions, the biotech / pharma industry is a great place to build a career. And it’s not cyclical. Huge unmet need in so many diseases and the constant demand for more efficacious medicines will always require innovative young scientists to come to the fore.

Sam, I follow and reference your “just start a website, dammit” advice and started my own a few months back. Goal is to post once every 7-10 days, and move that to once a week, soon. Without being “that guy” I’ll post the address below if you’ll allow it through. The site is very niche and (as far as I can tell) very unique. Well, maybe the end result in my
While White households are always near the national median due to Whites being by far the most prevalent racial demographic, the percentages of minority households with incomes exceeding $100,000 strayed considerably from their percentage of the overall population: Asian Americans, who represent the smallest surveyed racial demographic in the overall population, were the found to be the prevalent minority among six figure income households.
Hey Tom, thanks for this tutorial – it’s a good thing to get a tutorial like this from a trusted person like you and not from the thousands of (sometimes) confusing articles about passive income/affiliate marketing/clickfunnels and what not that I come across from time to time, I am making a living as a web designer and I have been thinking of pivoting from design and creative work to focus on passive income but didn’t know where to start. This is the perfect foundation article I have seen so far and I ‘d like to ask if you have any further reading/guides/videos on affiliate marketing that you’d recommend. I like to do my deep research before starting :) One more thing, there are some broken or missing images in this article, it could be my browser but check from your side too because there are quite a few images (e.g your Mercedes) that are missing. Thanks
Thanks for sharing this information. I actually work as a Project Management consultant in the technology and healthcare industry but I really want to get into construction project management because I love architecture I was also interested in natural resources project management just for a change but, it is very difficult to switch from one industry to another any advice?
Similar situation to Every Cent counts. I graduated with BA in political science from a relatively unknown school. I’m 26, but will break 6 figures in 1-2 years max (95k currently). Currently I have offers for 110-130k not including bonuses (I like my job so refusing for now, because work-life was suffering). I read up on in-demand tech skills like advanced analytics and software engineering. That’s how I did it. You don’t need to work at google, just be solid at programming and know in-demand skills.
Get good grades, go to a top school, get hired by a prestigious company in IT, finance or become a doctor, lawyer, engineer. DUH!!! Nothing Earth shattering that I didn’t know. If you don’t have the aptitude for those careers, you’re screwed for 100K salary I guess. Actually, you can become an entrepreneur, buy a franchise, write and sell a screen play to a hit movie, write a best seller, or offer specialized personal services to rich people (chef, trainer). Of course there’s also pornography. The sex trade makes billions.
Electrical engineers can crush it out of the park. Think startups and stock options. There’s not too many startups in oil industry, and I’m guessing only high level employees get stock. In electrical engineering, low level employees get stock. For me personally, despite earning a very high salary, it’s nowhere near what I made from stock… salary is almost negligible.
It’d be hard for Google to argue with this content not adding value. After all, some of the guides have received close to 10,000 shares and have been used by the brands themselves to educate their own customers. Generally speaking, each guide takes about 40-50 hours to produce, and is benchmarked to beat the best existing piece of content on the topic in virtually every aspect (from design and share-ability, to page speed and on-page SEO).
Most of the blogger or site owner are wanted to earn money by their blog or paid domain. Maximum time people choose affiliate marketing because of this sector has lots of opportunity to earn. But all of them are not follow the appropriate way or may be they do not know the way to do affiliate marketing. In fact i want to say that reading is post they are gain some easy idea to do affiliate marketing and they will be able to earn like you.
Amazon’s affiliate program is the most popular of them all. I don’t participate myself (yet) but the majority of affiliate marketers I know use Amazon because… it’s Amazon. You can review products you have used or write tutorials (eg. how to connect computer to TV) and drop an affiliate link to an HDMI cable… just a couple examples. You may want to build relationships with the manufacturers so you can get products before they’re released – giving you time to create a review before the product is launched and capture sales during peak buying times.
How to Get This Job: The American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends beginning preparations for your career as early as high school, by taking advanced classes in biology and chemistry and volunteering in hospital settings. Anesthesiologists must complete four years of college, four years of medical school, one year of internship, and three to four years of residency. Many opt for an additional fellowship year to train in a subspecialty like pain management, cardiac anesthesiology, or critical care medicine.
Michael Cheney claims he makes an almost effortless $39,041.46 every month. It’s interesting to note how he makes that figure with its fractions consistently. How’s that possible? Amazing! He further claims that his Commission Black Ops includes the best sales tactics known to the human race that even stark newbies can use to amass a fortune for themselves.
Take every notion, feeling, experience and expectation that you have on poetry and throw it up in the air, just take everything you’ve ever known about it and toss it aside. Not because the boundaries of what makes it so are being broken, and not because simple fundamentals and poetic structures are being altered, no that’s not it at all. Simply take a deep breath, relax and remember that nothing is off limits, nothing is too right or too wrong or completely outside the box(pun totally intended). So untie that bow, put your hand on the corner and open…open the book and take in that fresh page aroma and all the splendid “flavors” that is poetry.
My name is Justin Bienvenue, I was born in and reside in Massachusetts. I am a friendly and outgoing person. Always enjoy meeting new people. I graduated high school in 2006. As an author and poet, I have three published books, A book of Horror Poetry entitled, The Macabre Masterpiece: Poems of Horror and Gore published in 2011 and a Western Horror, A Bloody Bloody Mess In The Wild Wild West published in 2013 and Like A Box of Chocolates published in 2014. While I mainly enjoy writing poetry I have recently expanded my horizons and started writing stories, narratives and short stories. I enjoy writing and it always makes me satisfied to have others enjoy my work. I like to be creative and different, always trying new things. I have a background in creative writing which really helped me develop my writing and expand my imagination. When I’m not writing I also enjoy playing games and watching sports such as football, baseball and basketball. I also enjoy the outdoors, always playing sports whenever I get the chance and going for walks to gather my thoughts looking for my next best creative idea. Some of my interests include, History, Egyptology, Ufology, The Wild West and The Civil War.
Like a box of chocolates was an interesting collection of poetry. One word to describe it would be eclectic. The author writes about various topics, some dark, some lighter, and the poems themselves varied from more literal to a bit more metaphoric.
As a poet myself, I read this collection with a more critical eye, looking for depth and nuances and things that made me stop and think. This collection was more on the simpler side, which is not a bad thing. The differences between the pieces showcases the author's range of creativity. I have read a lot of poetry that I just could find no meaning to, but with this collection I was able to see where the author was going with his words, what picture he was trying to build for the reader, or what emotion he was trying to invoke.
It's a good start towards a serious path as a poet if that is what the author wishes to pursue. Go on and give this a read.
always trying without giving up and embarrassment , continue to fight as long as we can maintain it :)

Abstract: In order to increase the utilization of renewable energy sources and to reduce the need of generator-provided ancillary services and inefficient peaking generation, buildings are progressively transforming into smarter electricity consumers and active participants in power system operations. In this work, an R-C thermodynamic model of building that strongly relates to the power consumption of heating ventilation air-conditioning system (HVAC) is firstly introduced. To offer the aggregated flexible HVAC power to the grid as regulating power, we propose a building-aggregator-grid contract framework and formulate a robust model predictive control (MPC) algorithm which both maximizes the profit of aggregator and minimizes the payment of each participating building to optimally declare power flexibility. Lastly, simulation results on a group of real and hypothetical buildings validate the feasibility of the proposed method.

Thanks for such a great publish. I’m bringing my yorkie/shih tzu mix to the Philippines subsequent month thru Delta, i have already got an import permit from BAI. My question is, as i used to be looking out online on tips on how to journey pets, i noticed in the Philippine COnsulate webpage that i must have my well being certificates authenticated, i checked with BAI and it isn’t their requirement. now im wondering if i dont have it authenticated will it’s an issue. Did u need to have yours authenticated? I am from Saipan, Northern Marianas a US Territory and our Phil COnsulate is in Guam.
Some of the long run crew members with fifteen or more years flying might win a really perfect schedule just like the Dallas-to-Hawaii trip. The period of the flight was eight hours every approach which would give them solely 4 journeys a month to fulfill their minimal base hours. With all of the reserves in place, hardly any extra time was accessible.
Here’s an thought: Check your gauge and prime off your tank before heading into the park! The drive between there and most campgrounds is 12 to twenty miles a method.

Those of us that live in the Atlanta Metro area are all pretty familiar with Buckhead. And I have lived here for a little over 22 years... but I have a connection that goes back WAY before that.
I lost my father in 1997, and he never lived here... but he did visit Buckhead... LONG ago. He visited me several times after I moved to Atlanta in 1989, but when he was still a kid, he was passing through Buckhead with a few teammates. He was a student at the Columbia Military Academy in Columbia, TN, and on the Rifle Team. They had just completed a competition in South GA, and were passing through on the way back to school. It would have been around 1946... and my father would have been around the tender age of 14.
The driver of the car stopped in Buckhead for a short break. While he was out of the car, my father made a quick run into one of the local bars (yes, there were bars there then, too...) and bought a beer. He was in his Military Academy uniform, and the bartender probably assumed that he was a soldier...
True to his nature, we drove down to Buckhead one day... probably around 1995 or so... and he was able to show me the exact place that they were parked, as well as the bar where he got the beer. It wasn't a bar then, and now it doesn't even exist as a building, but we found an old picture... and he was right on point.
Oddly, my dad was never really a beer drinker. He joked that if he'd bought a 6-pack at that time, it might have been a lifetime supply.

Youth from the Berlin chapter of Youth for Human Rights International celebrated their freedom as part of the Youth for Human Rights International 2006 World Tour.
Although they are too young to remember the 27 years when the Berlin wall separated families and prevented East Germans from access to the West, these youngsters know that when the wall came down in 1989 that act became a symbol of freedom prevailing over oppression.
Youth for Human Rights and the Church of Scientology International have created 30 hard-hitting public service announcements (PSAs) to bring each of the 30 Articles of the Universal Declaration to life, to educate youth on their rights and responsibilities. Four of these PSAs were released in the German leg of the world tour including, appropriately, Article 9, which states:
The purpose of Youth for Human Rights International is: “To teach youth around the globe about Human Rights, thus helping them to become valuable advocates for the promotion of tolerance and peace.”
For there to be peace on earth reaquires the recognition and the upholding of Human Rights for all peoples. In alignment with the Aims of Scientology which are "A civilization without insanity, without criminals and without war, where the able can prosper and honest beings can have rights, and where man is free to rise to greater heights," Human Rights mus be made a fact. This is why the Church of Scientology International helped produce the Human Rights PSAs and why so many Scientologists are involved in getting them out broadly so everyone can see them and learn their rights.

GE on Tuesday unveiled new findings on how food and beverage manufacturers in the Middle East can achieve major improvements in efficiency, productivity, quality, sustainability, and agility by implementing digital industrial solutions. Released at Gulfood Manufacturing 2018, the white paper is entitled “Digital Transformation: A Bold Future for MENA Food and Beverage Manufacturing.” It examines how regional manufacturers are juggling multiple challenges – including a need to continually improve manufacturing quality and consistency, operational efficiency and productivity, and sustainability, health and safety standards – in an environment of rapidly changing consumer preferences.
The report finds that manufacturers and their partners across the F&B value chain can leverage powerful new digital applications and systems, known as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Industry 4.0 or Digital Industrial, to gain a competitive advantage today and prepare for an increasingly dynamic environment in the future.
In the face of rising input and labor costs; increasing demand for flexibility and agility on manufacturing lines; margin pressures that put a premium on process efficiency, productivity, uptime and quality; and a need for greater integration across manufacturing, distribution and retailing, digital industrial solutions can position manufacturers for success. The white paper identifies several Digital Industrial solutions particularly suited to the needs of F&B operators in the region, including Asset Performance Management (APM), Field Service Management, Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), and Digital Twin software.
“In looking at the current state of operations of many food and beverage manufacturers in the region, we see enormous opportunities for major enhancements to operations through the implementation of digital industrial solutions,” said Ali Saleh, Chief Commercial Officer in the Middle East, Africa and Turkey for GE Digital.
“We see that digital solutions can help manufacturers achieve operating efficiencies exceeding 95%, and realizing as much as a 10% reduction in both total cost of ownership and cost of production. While offering companies greater flexibility and a platform for innovating new products and services – and even new business models – digital industrial solutions give manufacturers the tools to deliver better efficiencies and quality for their customers,” he added.
According to the white paper, regional manufacturers can use digital industrial solutions to achieve the following outcomes:
• Shorter outage, repair and maintenance times by ensuring that the right engineers are available at the right time with the right equipment, parts, equipment history and repair expertise.
In addition to direct operational improvements, implementing these digital solutions in parallel with a companywide digital transformation creates a powerful platform for innovation. This is realized through new, more effective ways of manufacturing, or through entirely new lines, products or business models.
Also detailed in the paper is GE Digital’s work with Obeikan. Together, the partners are implementing a range of digital industrial solutions across Obeikan’s manufacturing operations. Several of its lines are already implementing these solutions, with the company ultimately looking to achieve auto-pilot manufacturing. Obeikan has also established Obeikan Digital Solutions as part of this partnership, which provides digital transformation services to F&B manufacturing companies in the region. — SG
Baked eye shadows are a must. So I thought it was a must to try. Firstly, baked eye shadows are mixture of mineral pigments and baked – usually in the sun- in order to set and give us a new incredible smooth texture. It can give us two looks, a dry application will give us a more natural finish but the wet – OMG – will give us a more intense dramatic look. It last longer than the normal eye shadow. They are using different pigments in order to have a –sheer- marbled look.
I have bought it online, in navy blue color at $22.00. Well for one shadow you can’t tell that is cheap but it is a bright and enough shimmery as it should be. It blends beautifully. It doesn’t age well, for some reason if you want to keep it for few months it will lose some kind of its formula., but if you are a person that will use regularly the specific eye shadow it worth to at least give it a try!
When I saw their marbled colours I fell in love with them and I’ve bought a punch of them (terracotta, khaki, malt, glitter pine, bronze, gold) on the unbelievable price of $1.00 each. Of course, I was a little skeptical on the begging if the formula was good upon its price. When I took them in my hands I was so a-m-a-z-e-d! The application is smooth and blends easily, the formula worth everything and they doesn’t age at all. All colours are enough pigmented and work beautifully dry and wet!

All babies suck their thumbs at one point or another, some even before they are born – expectant parents have seen it on the ultrasound! It’s a typical phenomenon that is completely harmless – up to a certain age. Sucking their thumb won’t cause long term damage while your child only has baby teeth, but when their permanent teeth start to come in the habit can begin to affect their smile long term.
Babies and small children often suck their thumbs to cope with stress and tension, or to to calm and settle themselves down. The habit is developed during feeding when they are infants, whether they are breastfed or bottle fed. Sucking is actually an instinctual reflex that babies are born with! This is a very important reflex because it makes eating possible.
Because thumb sucking makes babies feel secure (like a pacifier), some might eventually develop a habit of thumb sucking when they’re in need of soothing or going to sleep. Parents should monitor how often their child sucks their thumb, and if they child is actually sucking or just leaving their thumb in their mouth.
Children can suck their thumbs when they are very young without damaging the alignment of their teeth or jaws, but once their permanent teeth start coming in, around age 4-6, this habit can begin to cause long term issues. Prolonged thumb sucking most often causes issues like an anterior open bite (when your front teeth don’t come together but your molars do), a posterior crossbite (where your front teeth overbite and your molars underbite, creating a misalignment that crosses over around the canines), or an anterior excessive overjet (deep overbite where your top teeth significantly overhang your bottom teeth).
In more extreme situations, excessive thumb sucking can lead to bigger issues like the narrowing of the jaw or palate, altered breathing patterns, abnormal swallow patterns, hindered speech, or abnormal tongue rest. These issues typically only arise when the thumb sucking is chronic and lasts much longer than average. Pacifiers that are still used too late into development can also cause some of these same issues.
Replacement behaviors and solutions will work differently for different kids, so you may need to try a variety of solutions before you find the one that works best for your child. The first step should be having a conversation with your child about the thumb sucking. Communicate your concerns in terms that they will be able to understand, and see if reasoning and reminders are enough. If this does not work, you can try tactics like chewelry (‘jewelry’ designed for children to chew on when they are transitioning out of thumb sucking) or bad-tasting nail polish that is safe for kids. No matter what you try, be sure to praise your child when you notice that they have not been sucking their thumb. This will help reinforce their new habit.
While thumb sucking can help babies develop the muscles in their mouth, this benefit is maximized by early infancy. If these tactics do not work for you and your child, talk to your pediatric dentist for additional suggestions and support. We are here to help!

ECOtality, Inc. of Scottsdale, Ariz., a leader in clean electric transportation and storage technologies, on March 6 announced it has entered into a commitment with Nissan North America and Pima Association of Governments (PAG) to help establish electric vehicle (EV) charge infrastructure throughout Arizona's Pima County.
In conjunction with the anticipated 2010 launch of Nissan's zero-emission electric vehicle, ECOtality will initiate its EV Micro-Climate program in the Tucson region to promote sensible policies, intelligent deployment of charge infrastructure, and strong public awareness to foster the successful consumer adoption of grid-connected electric vehicles.
"ECOtality is uniquely positioned to assist Nissan and PAG in implementing the proper policies and physical infrastructure necessary for a seamless consumer transition to electric vehicles," said Jonathan Read, president and chief executive officer, ECOtality. "Working with relevant stakeholders, from policymakers to utilities, ECOtality will utilize our extensive EV installation history to ensure the implementation of charging infrastructure is done properly and efficiently, while minimizing the cost to public- and private-sector participants."
ECOtality, PAG, and Nissan have committed to work together to establish an EV Micro-Climate Working Group in Pima County that will unite strategic regional organizations to help streamline the rollout of charge infrastructure and public launch of grid-connected vehicles. In conjunction with these efforts, Nissan has committed to make available a supply of electric vehicles to the region's public and private fleets in 2010, the year Nissan's electric vehicle will be ready for the commercial market.
While the implementation of public charge infrastructure is planned to support the launch of Nissan's zero-emission vehicle, public charging stations in the Tucson region will meet all EV charge system standards (including the SAE J1772 Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler Specifications) to be universally compatible with new grid-connected vehicles of other major automakers.

A study of Old Grey Kladruber horses suggests that the heritability of insect bite hypersensitivity (sweet itch) is “medium to high.”
A long-term study from the Czech Republic confirms that horses can inherit a susceptibility to the allergic skin condition known as “sweet itch,” which is technically known as insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH).
A reaction to the saliva of culicoides and other biting midges, IBH often causes itchiness so intense that horses rub affected areas hairless or raw. It has long been suspected that IBH is inherited because the problem is more prevalent in particular breeds, such as Icelandic Horses.
The Czech study focused on Old Grey Kladruber horses, a native warmblood breed, at the National Stud in Kladruby and 10 private breeding facilities. The same person visually inspected the horses over a period of 13 years, from 1996 to 2009, scoring the severity of any signs of IBH at each observation. A total of 1,209 observations were entered in a database, along with information about each horse, including location, age and pedigree. Thereafter, the data were analyzed.
In statistics, the degree of a trait’s heritability is expressed on a 0 to 1 scale, with 0 meaning that none of the variability of the trait among individuals is the result of genetics and 1 meaning that genes are responsible for all the variability. The Czech researchers found the heritability of sweet itch susceptibility among the study horses ranged from 0.305 to 0.626, depending on the factors considered in the calculations. These numbers, the researchers say, indicate the heritability of sweet itch is “medium to high, so there is a possibility to reduce the prevalence of IBH by selection.”

I cannot believe we’ve already made it through a full workweek as MSBA 2016 students. It seems like it wasn’t that long ago that I was filling out the application, convincing my parents that spending a summer in New York was an amazing idea, and calling home in a flurry of excitement when I was accepted. It was actually not that long ago that I was nervously packing and saying my goodbyes for the summer. I can’t believe I ever considered not applying, and now that I’ve spent a week with the other program participants, I can’t believe I was nervous about meeting them.
“MSBA speakers continue to surprise me with the small lessons they teach that can be applied to my preferred path.”
The annual first-Friday Office Field Trip to Madison Square Garden was doubly special for me because I am interning in their Corporate Hospitality department (and because I didn’t have to fight the crowds at Penn Station to get to our evening program for once – still getting used to my loss of personal space in NYC). I can already tell The Garden is a special place to work. On top of being the ultimate space to learn hospitality and service, all of the full-time employees are so welcoming and seem to truly care about the student associates. I have not passed a new face in the office that has not stopped to extend a handshake and learn my name. Many have also offered their time to teach me what they do, even if their job is completely unrelated to mine. Everyone from my direct supervisor to her boss’s boss’s boss has an interest in creating sport industry professionals who will be successful in whatever they do.
This desire to see the student associates become well-rounded members of the sport industry is closely reflected by the programming of MSBA. I was hesitant at first when I learned the focus of our MSG panel would be sales, especially because I think the reason I prefer service is because I’m definitely not aggressive enough for sales. However, MSBA speakers continue to surprise me with the small lessons they teach that can be applied to my preferred path. Even though the sales professionals from the panel stated that they were “stewards of the brand” who “sell memories,” it occurred to me that they could not be so sure of the product they were selling if it were not for the service professionals. The sales team may sell the memories, but the service team creates them. Similarly, the sponsorships team designs partnerships, but the service team keeps it strong. My chosen area of corporate hospitality and premium services is rather niche, but it will require me to work closely with individuals from almost every other aspect of the company (and I can already prove it – in my first week, we met with more departments than I can name, some of which I didn’t even know existed!). If the MSBA programming can continue to deliver even small takeaways each day like the one from Friday, I know this will be the most valuable summer of my life.

Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet (c.1715—11 July 1774) was an Irish official of the British Empire. As a young man, Johnson moved to the Province of New York to manage an estate purchased by his uncle, Admiral Peter Warren, which was located amidst the Mohawk, one of the Six Nations of the Iroquois League. Johnson learned the Mohawk language and Iroquois customs, and was appointed the British agent to the Iroquois. Because of his success, he was appointed in 1756 as British Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the northern colonies. Throughout his career as a British official among the Iroquois, Johnson combined personal business with official diplomacy, acquiring tens of thousands of acres of Native land and becoming very wealthy.
Johnson commanded Iroquois and colonial militia forces during the French and Indian War, the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War (1754–1763) in Europe. His role in the British victory at the Battle of Lake George in 1755 earned him a baronetcy; his capture of Fort Niagara from the French in 1759 brought him additional renown. Serving as the British Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the northern district from 1756 until his death in 1774, Johnson worked to keep American Indians attached to the British interest.
William Johnson was born around 1715 in County Meath, in the Kingdom of Ireland.[2] He was the eldest son of Christopher Johnson (1687–1764) of Smithstown, Co. Meath and Anne Warren, daughter of Michael Warren of Warrenstown, Co. Meath and Catherine Aylmer, sister of Admiral Matthew Aylmer, 1st Baron Aylmer.
His mother Anne was from an "Old English" Catholic gentry family who had, in previous generations, lost much of their status to Protestant English colonists.[3] Christopher Johnson was descended from the O'Neill of the Fews dynasty of County Armagh. William Johnson's paternal grandfather was originally known as William MacShane, but changed his surname to Johnson, the Anglicisation of the Gaelic Mac Seáin.[4] Some early biographers portrayed William Johnson as living in poverty in Ireland, but modern studies reveal that his family lived a comfortable, if modest, lifestyle.O'Toole (2005), p. 37[5] Although the Johnson family had a history of Jacobitism, William Johnson's uncle Peter Warren was raised as a Protestant to enable him to pursue a career in the British Royal Navy. He achieved considerable success, gaining wealth along the way.[6]
As a Catholic, William Johnson had limited opportunities for advancement in the British Empire.[7] Never particularly religious, Johnson converted to Protestantism when offered an opportunity to work for his uncle in British America.[8]
Peter Warren had purchased a large tract of undeveloped land along the south side of the Mohawk River in the province of New York. Warren convinced Johnson to lead an effort to establish a settlement there, to be known as Warrensburgh, with the implied understanding that Johnson would inherit much of the land.[9] Johnson arrived in about 1738 with twelve Irish Protestant families and began to clear the land.[10] He purchased African slaves to do the heavy labor of clearance; they were the first of many slaves bought by Johnson.[11]
Warren intended Johnson to become involved in trading with American Indians, but Johnson soon discovered that the trade routes were to the north, on the opposite side of the river from Warrensburgh.[12] Acting on his own initiative, in 1739 Johnson bought a house and small farm on the north side of the river, where he built a store and a sawmill. From this location, which he called "Mount Johnson", Johnson was able to cut into Albany's Indian trade. He supplied traders with goods who were going to Fort Oswego, and he bought furs from them when they returned downriver. He dealt directly with New York City merchants and cut out the previous middlemen at Albany.[13] The Albany merchants were irate, and Warren was not pleased that his nephew was becoming independent.[14]
Johnson became closely associated with the Mohawk, the easternmost nation of the Six Nations of the Iroquois League. By the time Johnson arrived, their population had collapsed to only 580, due to chronic infectious diseases unwittingly introduced by Europeans and warfare with competing tribes related to the lucrative beaver trade.[15] The Mohawk thought an alliance with Johnson could advance their interests in the British imperial system. Sometime around 1742, they adopted him as an honorary sachem, or civil chief, and gave him the name Warraghiyagey, which he translated as "A Man who undertakes great Things".[16]
In 1744, the War of the Austrian Succession spread to colonial America, where it was known as King George's War. Because of his close relationship with the Mohawk, in 1746 Johnson was appointed as New York's agent to the Iroquois, replacing the Albany-based Indian commissioners.[17] The newly created "Colonel of the Warriors of the Six Nations" was instructed to enlist and equip colonists and Indians for a campaign against the French.[18] Recruiting Iroquois warriors was difficult: ever since the so-called Grand Settlement of 1701, the Iroquois had maintained a policy of neutrality in colonial wars between France and Great Britain.[19] Working with the Mohawk chief Hendrick Theyanoguin, Johnson was able to recruit Mohawk warriors to fight on the side of the British.[20] Johnson organised small raiding parties, which were sent against the settlements of the French and their Indian allies.[21] In accordance with New York's Scalp Act of 1747, Johnson paid bounties for scalps, although he realised this encouraged the scalping of non-combatants of all ages and both sexes.[22] In June 1748, Johnson was made "Colonel of the New York levies", a position that gave him additional responsibility for the colonial militias at Albany.[23] In July 1748, word was received of a peace settlement. The Mohawk had suffered heavy casualties in the war, which lessened Johnson's prestige among them for a while.[24]
In 1748, Johnson built a new stone house upriver from Mount Johnson, which became known as Fort Johnson.[25] The home was heavily fortified when the next war approached. In 1755, Johnson shifted the primary meeting place for diplomatic councils between the British and the Iroquois from Albany to Fort Johnson.[26] He also bought houses in Schenectady and Albany to stop at on his business trips to New York Town.[27]
After King George's War, Johnson was caught between rival New York political factions. One faction was led by Governor George Clinton, who had appointed Johnson as New York's Indian agent and, in 1750, appointed him to the Governor's Council.[28] Governor Clinton urged the New York Assembly to repay Johnson's outstanding wartime expenses, which amounted to £2,000.[29] Repayment was blocked by Clinton's political rivals, a faction led by Lieutenant Governor James De Lancey, who was connected to the Albany Indian commissioners whom Johnson had supplanted. De Lancey was also the brother-in-law of Admiral Peter Warren, which added to the strain in the relationship between Johnson and Warren.
An exasperated Johnson resigned as New York's Indian commissioner in 1751.[30] When Warren died in July 1752, he left nothing to Johnson in his will. Although Warren died a very wealthy man, in his will he required that Johnson repay the expenses incurred while settling Warren's land.[31]
In June 1753, Hendrick Theyanoguin and a delegation of Mohawk travelled to New York City, where they announced to Governor Clinton that the Covenant Chain—the diplomatic relationship between the British and the Iroquois—was broken.[32] The British government ordered Clinton to convene the Albany Congress of 1754 to repair the Covenant Chain.[33] At the Congress, the Mohawk insisted that the alliance would be restored only if Johnson were reinstated as their agent.[34]
Johnson's reinstatement as Indian agent came the following year, just as the French and Indian War, the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War, was escalating. In 1755, Major General Edward Braddock, sent to North America to direct the British war effort, appointed Johnson as his agent to the Iroquois.[36] Although Johnson had little military experience, he was commissioned as a major general and instructed to lead an expedition against the French fort at Crown Point.[37] His troops were provincial soldiers paid for by the colonies, and not regular soldiers of the British Army, which meant that he had to deal with six different colonial governments while organising the expedition.[38]
Johnson initially had nearly 5,000 colonials at his command, but General William Shirley, the governor of Massachusetts who had been commissioned to lead a simultaneous expedition to Fort Niagara, shifted some of Johnson's men and resources to his own campaign.[39] Tensions escalated as the two generals worked against each other in recruiting Native allies. The dispute was complicated by the unusual command structure: as Braddock's second-in-command, General Shirley was Johnson's superior officer, but when it came to Indian affairs, Johnson was theoretically in charge.[40] In time, Shirley would blame the failure of his expedition on Johnson's refusal to provide him with adequate Indian support. According to the Johnson biographer Milton Hamilton, historians usually portrayed Johnson as acting unreasonably in the controversy with Shirley, but Hamilton argued that Johnson was reacting to Shirley's clumsy Indian diplomacy, which harmed the British relationship with the Six Nations.[41]
Marching north into French territory, in August 1755 Johnson renamed Lac du Saint-Sacrement to Lake George in honour of his king.[42] On 8 September 1755, Johnson's forces held their ground in the Battle of Lake George. Johnson was wounded by a ball that was to remain in his hip or thigh for the rest of his life.[43] Hendrick Theyanoguin, Johnson's Mohawk ally, was killed in the battle, and Baron Dieskau, the French commander, was captured. Johnson prevented the Mohawk from killing the wounded Dieskau, an act memorialized in later paintings of the event.[44]
The battle brought an end to the expedition against Crown Point, and Johnson built Fort William Henry at Lake George to strengthen British defences.[45] In December, tired of army life, Johnson resigned his commission as major general.[46] General Shirley, who had become the commander in chief upon Braddock's death, sought to have Johnson's commission as Indian agent modified so that Johnson would be placed under his command.[47] But Shirley was soon replaced both as governor and commander in chief, and Johnson's star was on the rise.[48]
Although the Battle of Lake George was hardly a decisive victory, the British needed a military hero in a year of major setbacks, and Johnson became that man.[49] Claims that Johnson had been disabled by his wound early in the battle, and thus did not participate in the victory, did not reduce the recognition given to him.[50] As a reward for his services, Parliament voted Johnson £5,000 and King George made him a baronet.[24] "Never was such an insignificant encounter so generously rewarded", wrote the historian Julian Gwyn.[51]
In January 1756, the British government made Johnson sole Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the northern colonies. This position gave him great influence and power, since he would report directly to the government in London and would not be controlled by provincial governments, as the Department was a military one.[52] Of all the Indian nations in the northern colonies, Johnson was most knowledgeable about, and most closely connected to, the Iroquois Six Nations, especially the Mohawk. As superintendent, he would make the Iroquois the focus of British diplomacy, promoting and even exaggerating the power of the Iroquois Confederacy. Johnson also began a long process of trying to control Iroquois diplomacy, attempting "nothing less than the refurbishment of the Iroquois confederacy with himself as its centre".[53]
Although Johnson was no longer a British general, he continued to lead Iroquois and frontier militia. In August 1757, after the French began their siege of Fort William Henry, Johnson arrived at Fort Edward with 180 Indians and 1,500 militia.[54] Greatly overestimating the size of the French army, British General Daniel Webb decided against sending a relief force from Fort Edward to Fort William Henry. The British were compelled to surrender Fort William Henry, after which many were killed in an infamous massacre. Stories circulated that Johnson was enraged by Webb's decision not to send help, and that he stripped naked in front of Webb to express his disgust.[55]
With the war going badly for the British, Johnson found it difficult to enlist the support of the Six Nations, who were not eager to join a losing cause. In July 1758, he managed to raise 450 warriors to take part in a massive expedition led by the new British commander, General James Abercrombie.[56] The campaign ended ingloriously with Abercrombie's disastrous attempt to take Fort Carillon from the French. Johnson and his Indian auxiliaries could do little as British forces stormed the French positions in fruitless frontal assaults.[57]
Johnson, in green, is depicted in Benjamin West's iconic painting The Death of General Wolfe, although he was not present at the event.[58]
In 1758, with the capture of Louisbourg, Fort Frontenac, and Fort Duquesne, the war's momentum began to shift in favour of the British.[59] Johnson was able to recruit more Iroquois warriors. In the summer of 1759, he led nearly 1,000 Iroquois warriors—practically the entire military strength of the Six Nations—as part of General John Prideaux's expedition to capture Fort Niagara.[60] When Prideaux was killed, Johnson took command.
He captured the fort after ambushing and defeating a French relief force at the Battle of La Belle-Famille. Johnson is usually credited with leading or at least planning this ambush,[61] but the historian Francis Jennings argued that Johnson was not present at the battle, and that he exaggerated his role in official dispatches.[24] The conquest of Niagara drove the French line back from the Great Lakes. Once more, Johnson was celebrated as a hero, although some professional soldiers expressed doubts about his military abilities and the value of the Iroquois in the victory.[62] Johnson commanded the "largest Native American force ever assembled under the British flag."[63]
Johnson accompanied General Jeffery Amherst in the final North American campaign of the Seven Years' War, the capture of Montreal in 1760. With the fall of New France to the British, Johnson and his deputy George Croghan spent much time negotiating with the former Indian allies of the French. In 1761, Johnson made a 1,000-mile (1,600 km) round trip to Detroit to hold a conference with the regional American Indians.[64] Johnson confronted the assembled chiefs about the anti-British rumours that were circulating among the Natives, and managed, for the time being, to forestall outright resistance to the British military occupation of the West.[65] Normand Macleod met Johnson at this conference and returned with him to New York. Macleod was later appointed as commander of Fort Oswego, on Lake Ontario.[66]
After the French and Indian War, Johnson hoped to concentrate on expanding and improving his land holdings.[67] In December 1760, the Mohawk of Canajoharie gave Johnson a tract of about 80,000 acres (320 km2) north of the Mohawk River.[68] This grant proved to be controversial because other land speculators had already obtained licenses to purchase lands that the Mohawk released for sale, but Sir William had not.[69] In 1769, after years of manoeuvring and lobbying, Johnson finally gained royal approval for the grant.[70] This was one of several large tracts of land that Johnson acquired from the Mohawk and Iroquois using his position as a royal Indian agent. By the time of his death, Johnson had accumulated about 170,000 acres (690 km2)[22]</ref> and was one of the largest land owners in British America, surpassed only by the Penn and van Rennsalaer families.[citation needed] According to historian Julian Gwyn:
In all this he acted no differently from dozens of other speculators in Indian lands. He was distinguished only by the great advantages he possessed through his office and through his long intimacy with the Indians. He was indeed one of their principal exploiters....[51]
In 1762, Johnson founded the city of Johnstown on his grant, about 25 miles (40 km) west of Schenectady, New York, north of the Mohawk River. He named the new settlement, originally called John's Town, after his son John. There, at Crown expense,[51] he established a free school for both white and Mohawk children.[71]
Outside the town, in 1763 he built Johnson Hall, where he lived until his death. He recruited numerous Irish immigrant tenant farmers for his extensive lands, and lived essentially as a feudal landlord. He also purchased African-American slaves to work as labourers, especially in his lumber operations. Johnson had some 60 slaves working for him, making him the largest slaveholder in the county and likely in the province, comparable to major planters of the South.[72] In 1766, Johnson organised St. Patrick's Lodge, No. 4, a Freemason lodge, at Johnson Hall, and was installed as its master. His nephew Guy Johnson succeeded him as master of this lodge in 1770.[73]
Johnson was a strong supporter of the Anglican Church in the colony.[74] To counter the influence of French Catholic missionaries in western New York, in 1769 he paid for the construction of an Anglican church for the Mohawk of Canajoharie, a village the British called the "Upper Castle". The building, later used by European-American congregations and known as Indian Castle Church, still stands near Danube, New York. It is part of the Mohawk Upper Castle Historic District, a National Historic Landmark.[75][76] In 1771, Johnson built St. John's Episcopal Church in Johnstown, but soon complained that it was "small and very ill built." Within five years, he arranged for a larger church of stone to be constructed to accommodate the growing congregation in Johnstown. The historic church is still operating.[77]
In 1763, Pontiac's War resulted from Native American discontent with British policy following the French and Indian War. For several years prior to the uprising, Johnson had advised General Jeffery Amherst to observe Iroquois diplomatic practices, for instance, awarding gifts to Native leaders, a practice they considered an important cultural symbol of respect and significant to maintaining good relations. Amherst, who rejected Johnson's advice, was recalled to London and replaced by General Thomas Gage. Amherst's recall strengthened Johnson's position, because a policy of compromise was required with the Indians, and this was Johnson's domain. Johnson negotiated a treaty with Pontiac in 1766, which finally ended the war.
From July to August 1764, Johnson negotiated a treaty at Fort Niagara with about 2,000 American Indians in attendance, primarily Iroquois. Although most Iroquois had stayed out of the war, the Seneca from the Genesee River valley had taken up arms against the British, and Johnson worked to bring them back into the Covenant Chain alliance. Johnson convinced the Iroquois to send a war party against the Seneca involved in the uprising, but otherwise the Iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as Johnson had desired.[78]
Johnson was a proponent of the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which called for tighter imperial control and restraint of westward colonial expansion. Johnson negotiated the details of the boundary defined in the Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768. Against instructions from London, Johnson pushed the boundary 400 miles (640 km) to the west, enabling him and other land speculators to acquire much more land than originally authorised by the British government. Johnson was strongly criticised for exceeding his instructions, but many of the land speculators were well-connected in the government, and the expanded boundary was allowed to stand.
Native American discontent continued to grow in the west in the 1770s. Johnson spent his final years attempting to prevent another uprising like Pontiac's War. Pursuing a policy of divide and rule, he worked to block the emergence of intertribal Native American alliances. His final success was his isolation of the Shawnee before Dunmore's War in 1774.
In his lifetime, Johnson gained a reputation as a man who had numerous children with several European and Native American women.[79] At the time, men were not ostracised for having illegitimate children, as long as they could afford it and supported them. One 20th-century scholar estimated that Johnson had perhaps 100 illegitimate children,[80] but the historian Francis Jennings argued that "there is no truth in wild stories that he slept with innumerable Mohawk women."[24] In his will, Johnson acknowledged children by Catherine Weisenberg and Molly Brant, German and Mohawk, respectively, with whom he had long-term relationships. He implicitly acknowledged several other children by unnamed mothers.
In 1739, shortly after arriving in America, William began a relationship with Catherine Weisenberg (c. 1723–1759), a German Electorate of the Palatinate immigrant. She originally came to the colonies as an indentured servant, but had run away, perhaps with the help of friends or relatives.[81] According to tradition, she was working for another family near Warrensburgh when Johnson purchased the remainder of her indenture contract, perhaps initially to have her serve as his housekeeper.[82] There is no record that the couple ever formally married,;[83] Weisenberg was Johnson's common-law wife.[24] The couple had three children, including daughters Nancy and Mary (Polly), and a son John, first christened under only Weisenberg's name at Fort Hunter.[84] The senior Johnson later arranged for his son John to inherit his title and estates as John Johnson.[85] A grandson of Sir William Johnson was the 3rd Baronet Sir Adam Gordon Johnson who was, through his mother Ann Watts, descendants of the Schuyler family, the Delancey family, and the Van Cortlandt family of British North America.[86][87]
At the same time, Johnson had a relationship with Elizabeth Brant, a Mohawk woman by whom he had three children: Keghneghtago or Brant (born in 1742), Thomas (1744) and Christian (1745); the latter two boys died in infancy.[88] About 1750, Johnson had a son named Tagawirunta, also known as William of Canajoharie, by a Mohawk woman, possibly Margaret Brant, Elizabeth's younger sister.[89] Johnson may have also been intimate with the sisters Susannah and Elizabeth Wormwood, and an Irish woman named Mary McGrath, by whom he appeared to have had a daughter named Mary.[90] Mary, Keghneghtago (Brant), and Tagawirunta (William) received inheritances in Johnson's will.[91]
In 1759, Johnson began a common-law relationship with Molly Brant, a Mohawk woman who moved into Johnson Hall and lived with Johnson as his consort for the rest of his life. Molly was the older sister of Joseph Brant; her younger brother joined the household when he was young. Johnson's relationship with Molly gave him additional influence with the Mohawk. The couple had eight children, all of whom received land from Johnson in his will.[92] A grandson of William Johnson and Molly Brant was William Johnson Kerr who married Elizabeth Brant a daughter of Joseph Brant and granddaughter of George Croghan.
Johnson died from a stroke at Johnson Hall on 11 July 1774 during an Indian conference. Guy Johnson, William's nephew and son-in-law (he had married Mary/Polly), reported that Johnson died when he was "seized of a suffocation."[93] His funeral in Johnstown was attended by more than 2,000 people. His pallbearers included Governor William Franklin of New Jersey and the justices of the New York Supreme Court. He was buried beneath the altar in St. John's Anglican church, the church he founded in Johnstown. The next day chiefs of the Six Nations performed the traditional Iroquois condolence ceremony, and recognised Guy Johnson as Sir William's successor.[94]
During the American Revolution, the rebel New York legislature seized all of Johnson's lands and property, as his heirs were Loyalists. In 1960 Johnson Hall was named a National Historic Landmark. It is a designated State Historic Site and open to the public.
Johnson's most important legacy is the comparatively peaceful co-existence of Anglo-Americans and Indians during his tenure as Indian Agent for British North America. As an adopted Mohawk chief and husband, according to Iroquois law, of Mohawk Mary Brant, he was a trusted counselor and member of Mohawk nation and, through that affiliation, the Five Nations of the Iroquois. That position gave him standing not only to lead Iroquois into battle on the side of the English, but also to negotiate two treaties of Fort Stanwix, modern day Rome, New York. While the treaties deprived many Indians of land without their knowledge, they gave favourable terms to the Iroquois, and resulted in decades of comparative peace between traditional Indian residents and new settlers.
Co-existence was part of Johnson's other major historical legacy: the protection of British sovereignty and Anglo-American settlement as a bulwark against French control of northern New York State and the Great Lakes region more generally. Johnson was instrumental in sustaining British-Iroquois alliance through the Covenant Chain, which consolidated both Iroquois and British territorial and commercial interests against the rival Algonquin and French interests in New France before 1763. After Britain assumed control, Johnson eventually won a political dispute over Indian policy with Lord Jeffery Amherst, who disdained the Iroquois alliance Johnson had so devoted himself to nurturing and defending. It was to Johnson that Pontiac finally surrendered after the eventual failure of the rebellion named for him.
Old Fort Johnson, his first home built in 1749, is on the Historic American Buildings Survey. It is currently the home of the Montgomery County Historical Society, which operates a museum, gift shop, and holds events. Guy Park Manor, built in 1773, for Sir William's daughter Mary (Polly) and her husband, his nephew Guy Johnson, is also open to the public.
The Johnstown High School mascot is the "Sir Bill" in Johnson's honour (or "Lady Bill" for all-female teams). The teams' sportswear often depicts Johnson's silhouette, wearing a tricorne hat.[95]
Johnson appears as an antagonist in the 2012 video game Assassin's Creed III, and he is killed by the game's protagonist, Connor Kenway.[96] He also makes an appearance in the 2014 video game Assassin's Creed Rogue.[97]
Wilderness Empire (1968) by Allan W Eckert tells Johnson's story through the device of historical fiction by extracting information from historical documents and filling in imagined events and dialogs to make the telling more accessible to the average reader.

May 2017 has seen a slight drop in average fuel prices, mirroring a similar drop in the price of a barrel of oil, which is now bang on $50.
The most expensive place to buy fuel is the South East of England, whereas if you were willing to drive to the North East you'd find the cheapest prices at the pumps (although the minimal 1.5p per litre difference would quickly negate any benefits!).

This quantity includes 3 lengthy lecture sequence through J. L. Colliot-Thelene, Kazuya Kato and P. Vojta. Their issues are respectively the relationship among algebraic K-theory and the torsion algebraic cycles on an algebraic kind, a brand new method of Iwasawa conception for Hasse-Weil L-function, and the purposes of arithemetic geometry to Diophantine approximation.
Therefore, we can also obtain the theorem of permutability by this symmetry. 9 can be applied not only to the AKNS system, but also to many other evolution equations, especially to the Lax pairs whose U and V are polynomials of λ. On the other hand, we also show that those Darboux matrices include all the diagonalizable Darboux matrices of the form λI − S, and any non-diagonalizable Darboux matrix can be obtained from the limit of diagonalizable Darboux matrices. 138) n−j Vj (x, t)λ , j=0 Uj ’s and Vj ’s are N × N matrices.
Since r− (ζ) and r+ (ζ) are holomorphic in C+ and C− respectively, their zeros are discrete. These zeros are the eigenvalues of L. The set of all eigenvalues of L is denoted by IP σ(L). 270) has a nontrivial bounded solution. σ(L) = R ∪ IP σ(L) is called the spectrum of the operator L. Its compliment C − σ(L) is called the regular set of L. Property 4. If r− (ζ) = 0 and r+ (ζ) = 0 hold for ζ ∈ R, then IP σ(L) is a ﬁnite set. Hereafter, we always suppose r− (ζ) = 0 and r+ (ζ) = 0 when ζ ∈ R. First we consider the eigenvalues.

'We're being unfairly accused': Teen Vogue dismisses 14-year-old girls during meeting after anti-Photoshop protest
A group of teenage girls staged a protest outside Teen Vogue's offices on Wednesday, asking the fashion magazine to publicly commit to using 'Photoshop-free, diverse images of real girls.'
Holding signs and walking arm-in-arm, Carina Cruz and Emma Stydahar of the girl-fueled Spark Movement, staged a mock runway show in the middle of Times Square in an effort to give the editors, and the world, an idea of what real girls look like.
petition to the magazine with more than 20,000 signatures, however they told Jezebel the editors reactions were not what they expected.
Runway protest: Demanding that Teen Vogue use real girls and healthy looking models, 14-year-old protesters held a mock fashion show before delivering deliver 20,000 anti-Photoshop signatures
They explained: 'We walked in, there was no handshake, no “my name is”, none of that. Just, “you sit here, you sit there. So you wanted this meeting – what do you want to say” We said what is in our petition… They proceeded to take out handfuls of magazines with little Post-It notes in them, [marking] what they perceived to be diverse images.
'Most of them were thin African-American models. It was a good start – we love seeing women of color in these magazines. But two or three an issue – and all of them super stick skinny – isn't what we're looking for.'
Emma added that the meeting consisted of the editors telling the teenagers that they hadn't 'done their homework', and that 'Teen Vogue is a great magazine, being unfairly accused.'
Both Emma and Carina were inspired by 14-year-old fellow Spark member Julia Bluhm's recent quest and anti-Photoshop protest against Seventeen magazine.
Some success: After 14-year-old fellow Spark member Julia Bluhm staged an anti-Photoshop protest against Seventeen magazine, the editor-in-chief publicly responded (left), which inspired the Teen Vogue protest (right)
After she delivered a petition with 25,000 signatures to ban Photoshop from the magazine, the editors publicly promised not to alter girls' faces or bodies.
However, at the same time, Seventeen magazine didn't outright agree to stop Photoshopping its models and celebrity subjects, and also did not commit to publishing any un-retouched photo spreads.
Miss Bluhm's crusade, while not wholly successfully, was still met with public consideration by the magazine's editor-in-chief, Ann Shoket, surrounding the points the 14-year-old brought forward.
And as Jezebel noted, when Miss Bluhm met with editors at Seventeen, there were cupcakes and a tour of the office.
Jezebel wrote: 'What Emma and Carina are asking for goes beyond banning Photoshop. They want a wider variety of faces, disclosure if a pimple is removed – a magazine they can relate to.'
As it states in their petition, the girls only want magazines to stop altering natural bodies and faces so that real girls can be 'the new standard of beauty'.
The girls also explained their reason for targeting Teen Vogue, simply because they see the magazine as the leader in its teen-targeted field, with the most power to affect change.
Teen Vogue’s Senior Public Relations Director, Erin Kaplan, said in a statement: 'Teen Vogue makes a conscious and continuous effort to promote a positive body image among our readers.
'We feature healthy models on the pages of our magazine and shoot dozens of non-models and readers every year and do not retouch them to alter their body size. Teen Vogue pledges to continue this practice.'

And to you; thank you Joe Hockey. We will get to the Budget and economic issues in a moment, but first, Tony Abbott told the Press Club that he is the best person to lead the Government. Now considering the Government's fractured relationship with the electorate, what does that say about the rest of you?
Well, it says that we’ve got to work harder for the Australian people to ensure that they get more jobs, better quality of life and have hope for the future. Now, we've seen over the last 12 months, a significant surge in employment, running at three times the speed of what it was under Labor; nearly 600 jobs created each day last year compared to around 200 the year before. But we still have challenges in terms of the Budget and the economy. At the moment, we are spending over $100 million a day more than we're collecting in revenue. Now that's unsustainable, particularly given we're spending nearly $40 million a day on the interest on the debt that we have.
They do matter to the Australian people but the leadership issue is, as Peter Reith has written this morning, ‘the leadership genie is now out of the bottle’. Won't the leadership have to be settled before it is allowed to drag on too long and so it will enable you to get back to those issues that matter?
Well, you see Alison, there's lots of commentators; there's lots of commentary from former Members of Parliament…
…And I would say to everyone, focus on your own job and doing your job at your best rather than speculating about other jobs. You know, what matters – what matters to everyone, is how we are going to make Australia better and that's what we're focused on.
And your name has not been mentioned as one of the possible contenders for the job, if indeed Tony Abbott departs. Do you still harbour ambitions to lead the Liberal Party?
We've had five governments – five governments in eight years, Alison. Australians want stability and certainty and that's what we are offering with a policy platform that fixes up the mess we inherited and builds jobs for Australians. I would say to everyone, if you continue to worry about your own job as a Member of Parliament, you will surely lose that job. You've got to focus on others.
And Tony Abbott is one MP who is clearly worried about his job. He said yesterday to the Press Club that he can only be fired by the voters, not by his colleagues. Is he making himself immune to party authority?
Hang on, hang on, when the Labor Party had a rotating leadership, all the Members of the Liberal Party prosecuted the argument that Kevin Rudd was elected by the people, Kevin Rudd should be fired by the people.
Whatever – other people can have views. That was the line we prosecuted, that's the line we believe. Now, there is no good that can come from having constant change in leadership when Australians want us to focus on what's good for them rather than what's good for ourselves. So, let me be very blunt: we want to focus on small businesses, on families. Tony Abbott made a number of important announcements yesterday about cracking down on unlawful foreign ownership of Australian residential real estate, about having a proper register for agricultural investment by foreigners, and importantly, lowering the threshold for approvals. Things like this make a difference to people's lives because ultimately we want to lower the cost of living; make Australia more prosperous.
And that's fair enough but many within the Liberal Party are still vexed by the fallout from the Queensland election. It's not just Peter Reith who has had his say this morning, so too Peter Costello. He says the Queensland Government was mangled by the Federal Government, not just the $20 Medicare co-payment, but also the knighthood for Prince Philip. He’s described that – or he's written about it being the barbecue stopper of the century. Can you afford to ignore the sentiments of someone like Peter Costello?
I think Tony Abbott dealt with that yesterday by saying that all the honours for Australia would be given to an independent council where Australians have the opportunity to nominate and it's made by that independent council, not by any single Member in the Government or any Prime Minister or anyone else. So, that's been dealt with. But let's focus on what matters to every day Australians. We've got lower electricity prices, we've got fuel prices that have dropped so significantly they're equivalent to two interest rate cuts, and we've got low interest rates that may well end up even lower over time. So, the challenge for every day government is to focus on what matters to the Australian people, not on what matters for the self-interest of local Members.
And some of your MPs are focusing still on knighthoods though. You've got a couple of back-benchers proposing a Private Members Bill to abolish imperial honours all together. You're a Republican; will you be supporting that Bill?
Look Alison, we'll see what comes forward in the circumstances but, you know, that's a side issue – that's a side issue.
Do you know what my job is? To focus on the fact that we're spending – as a government – $100 million more everyday than we're collecting. The fact that every day, we're spending $40 million on interest, on the debt Labor left behind, and that interest bill is growing. So, that's my job. I would urge everyone to focus, in government, on their job. Do your best for Australia and stop focusing on self-interest.
And it is your job to put together the next Budget, which will come down in May. The Prime Minister said yesterday that the Commonwealth Budget will not be put together at the expense of the household budget. Are you ruling out any fresh savings measures akin to say, the GP co-payment or the higher education reforms? In other words, will this be a pain-free Budget for households?
That's what we are endeavouring to do. The challenge, as I said, is that we are spending $100 million more every day, than we are collecting in revenue. Now, the Labor Party keeps standing in the way of our attempts to reduce that spending. We are trying to do our best to get that level of expenditure down, because if we lower the level of expenditure, we don't have to increase taxes…
…And yesterday, the Prime Minister said, we want to do everything we can to lower the taxes for small business because that is the engine room of the Australian economy. And if we can free up the taxation and regulatory burden on small business, I think what you will see, Alison, is a compelling story that helps to deliver greater growth and more jobs for everyday Australians.
And what about the tax burden on bigger business? The Government is reframing its policy agenda. The Paid Parental Leave Scheme is gone, but the 1.5 per cent levy on big business to pay for it; can you clarify if that Levy will still be applied?
We'll have more to say, as we get to the Budget, about that. We want to, obviously lower all taxes – company tax, personal income tax. We want to lower the burden but we've got to also lower expenditure over time. Now, in relation to the levy, we are working that through but I'd say to you, Alison, again, one of the things the Prime Minister focused on yesterday was childcare and you know, it is a big issue for families. If we can lift the level of workforce participation of women in Australia – the same level as that of Canada, our economy would be $25 billion a year bigger, which means more jobs and greater wealth for everyday Australians. So, what we've got to do is invest more and focus more on a flexible childcare system, and importantly, give women greater choice.
Big business will be the beneficiary of a stronger economy. You know, that's the fact. Big business and shareholders benefit from a stronger Australian economy. There's many levers that are available to government but we are working that through to build the prosperity people expect.
And Treasurer, that takes us to economic reform. Queensland voters quite emphatically rejected Campbell Newman's privatisation program. Won't that mean that other governments will be more reluctant to pursue asset sales, infrastructure reform? Where does that leave your policy of asset recycling? You must be worried that voters are spurning the idea?
We have been approached by the ACT Labor Government to be the first signatory to our Asset Recycling Program. And why? Because governments haven't got the discretionary money to be able to build the infrastructure that Australia really needs. Now, either you recycle the money you have and still keep assets in the hands of the Australian people or investors. I mean obviously, you know, you can't pick up a road or an electricity grid and take it overseas. It will still perform its function and people spend a lot of money buying those assets – it's still got to deliver electricity or water or traffic. So, what we are focused on is how we can get the best out of taxpayers' money and build more. Now, our Asset Recycling Program does that. It is absolutely essential for NSW, which is, you know, the beacon of strength in the Australian economy at the moment. I can't believe the East-West Link in Melbourne; I mean, how absurd that the Victorian Government by cancelling East-West, is about to spend $1.2 billion not to have a road, and if they spend $1.5 billion they would have a massive road.
But is there going to be the political heart among these governments to pursue these reforms considering the voter backlash? Don't you need to reassure voters, for example, that asset sales won't necessarily mean higher prices? That's what people are worried about.
I think that is important, you make a good point, Alison. I think we need to work harder on communication, there's no doubt about that. Last year, we spent the year with our heads buried in the books trying to make things add up, trying to deliver the change that strengthens the Australian economy over time. Now, because we did create three times the number of jobs every day that occurred under the last year of Labor, it started to work but there's more work to be done and obviously communication is part of that. When we release the Intergenerational Report in a few weeks’ time, that will engage – through that – we will engage in a detailed conversation at every street corner, at every town hall with the Australian people about how we can collectively meet head on the challenges of the future and embrace them.
And are you prepared to have that conversation in the NSW election, which is next month? It's your home State, so too the Prime Minister’s. Have you both been invited to campaign to help out Mike Baird?
He's the Prime Minister for the whole of Australia; I'm the Treasurer for the whole of Australia. I'm not someone who is parochial about State interests, Alison. I don't see State borders. I put the whole country first and I expect others would do the same.
Look, I'm not going to get into sort of speculation about speculation. Alison, look, I think we need to get back to the basics and that is to focus on what's in the best interests of the Australian people and that's what we’re going to do.

Pishin-Pajouh Cultural and Art Institute was established in 1997 by a group of archaeologists who were granted the needed certificates by the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. As its objective, the Institute seeks to promote studies on Iran, especially from archaeological and anthropological viewpoints. The institute enjoys its position as being among the first NGOs of its type. It was established at a time when Iranian cultural heritage authorities were gradually starting cooperation with the private sector.
A considerable portion of the first years following inauguration was spent in endeavors to attract government authorities, including the Iranian Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts, and Tourism Organization and the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, to collaborate, and this came about only after several years of activities to prepare the needed groundwork.
The activities of the Institute have been divided into three categories—namely, research, publications, and gatherings and exhibitions. Considerable contributions have been done in each division at provincial and national levels. What follows only covers activities related to ICH.
It is worth mentioning that the achievements reported below have been accomplished with close, constructive collaboration with the Anthropology Research Centre to the Iranian Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization.
Ethnographies (fieldwork on clothing, food, rituals, and language among other tangible and intangible cultural features)
Accomplished in forty days by a team of twenty anthropologists, the project resulted in the 2008 release of the following five volumes of books on Isfahan and its people, on the occasion of nominating Isfahan as the Capital of the World of Islam:
Two exhibitions on Iranian rituals and clothes on two occasions of the Iranian Cultural Heritage Week were held. Each lasted for ten days and hosted approximately 400,000 visitors.
Pishin Pajouh participated in this exhibition following an invitation by Dr. Yadollah Parmoun, Director of the Linguistic Atlas of Iran National Project and the Director of the Tehran ICH Centre. At the event, Pishin Pajouh presented the Linguistic Atlas of Iran as well as other achievements of the country in the field of intangible cultural heritage, including its inscriptions on UNESCO Lists.
The implementation phase of the Linguistic Atlas of Iran was proposed by the Pishin Pajouh Institute, constituting a major step to protect and promote intangible cultural heritage throughout Iran. Following this proposal, the project was immediately approved and supported by the Research Institute to the Iranian Cultural Heritage, Handicrafts and Tourism Organization (RI-ICHHTO). Based upon a thirty-five-year-old background of linguistic documentation and a firm computational programming during which the project manifested as a computational linguistic atlas, the implementation phase started with linguistic data entry. The team members, thirty experts with an MA or PhD in linguistics, were first trained by Dr Yadollah Parmoun in a one-month workshop. The first phase of data entry resulted in the transcription of 10,000 linguistic interviews, using the standard International Phonetic Alphabet.
Stabilizing national unity by proving the presence of a shared linguistic heritage in the background of the superficial linguistic diversity observable throughout the Islamic Republic of Iran
Iranian Ministry of Science, Research and Technology, especially the subsection involved in preparing the Comprehensive Scientific Map of the Islamic Republic of Iran to determine the Iranian cultural priorities and to cooperate properly with the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Section
By the end of the first phase, the project was elected by the Deputy for Technology to the President’s Office, Islamic Republic of Iran, among the thirty most prominent projects of the Republic. The contractor to the project—namely, Pishin Pajouh Cultural and Art Institute—was praised as the active private sector institute.
Following this, the project took part in the Simorgh Exhibition of 2010, and was visited by a great number of prominent governmental figures, Members of the Cabinet, governmental managers, and ordinary people.

Its insulting in its timing and the delusion that a teenager's "me too" is a right of passage. The disparity in size (Hammer's giant) and childlike looks (Timothee Chalamet) adds unseemliness to its presentation. Hammer distributes much awkwardness and little desire, maybe because he realized the discomfort of its subject.
Man/boy love is tricky if you don't account for its repercussions. It doesn't represent the gay community but it indicates that straits will stick it to anything and that uniting in sex will not absolve our confusion.

i just visited ltsp website , looks as a very sound solution, but i have one question left open, will it run the 3D windows programs , like for example CAD apps?
i have seen on the site that it can run windows apps, so it would be linux desktops and an windows 3D cad program
the workstations would run a linux desktop, but should also be able to run windows apps like for example 3D cad,
stgraber, highvoltage: I'm going to create some start/stop etc substitutes to prevent upstart daemons from starting in the chroot while the ltsp client is building
stgraber, highvoltage: I just tried building a fat client with stgraber's ppa in my sources, and I got this:
So I'm going to create those substitutes in /var/lib/ltsp, and put them into $PATH before /usr/sbin.
knipwim: what options? I was thinking an option to copy the root's password on the server, from the shadow file... :)
I think you could just go ahead and commit it... since 4 out of 6 distros don't want it in common/, I don't see any point of keeping it there
thats up to the distro .... where its usualy managed via packaging ... which indeed gentoo doesnt use
and since ltsp-update-image is also used for creation of fresh images you cant check for existance of an nbd image
Hi. I have trouble getting my clients to login to the server. Clients boot OK, SSH works, but after login the client returns to the login screen. I got i working for a short while. By changing the default session in gdm on the server, but now it is broken again after just 5 min. Any ideas?
(I was trying with tftp 10.160.31.10 == localhost to see why it wasn't working... it does work now, but I don't know why!)
ogra, can you remember what was the deal with DEBCONF_FRONTEND? Does it help anywhere, or can I just disable it for fat clients?
astbis: can you also try putting XSERVER=vesa in lts.conf, to verify that it isn't something X related?
given that i never made it actualy work right you could as well back out to noninteractive though ... but test the CD install if it still works then
It is already VESA. My lts.conf settings worked fine until for a short while ago. But suddenly, without me at the server the clients refused to login.
It has been a little over 10 years since Roan Jones built the engine for the vehicle he later went on to assemble on his own - the same ride he is proudest of today.
"Building your own car and competing with it, trust me, you have so many butterflies in your stomach to know it is a product of you, by you, from you," he told Automotives.
"My car came from scraps," Jones said. "Ninety per cent of my car is from other people's cars. Where they don't need those parts and they throw them out, I use them. I think everything can be recycled. Everything on my car is a product of something that somebody threw away."
For Jones, the inability to afford something is a driving force for innovation, a lesson he learned as a youngster. When his parents could not afford to buy him toy cars, he resorted to making his own out of the resources to which he had access.
"I would make them (toy cars) out of boxes and spray cans, and that's how my love for motorsports started - by experimenting," he said.
As Jones grew up, he wanted to do more, naturally, so he went to school to become a mechanic. "Then I became a fabricator, so to speak, with motor vehicles. And I fabricated a lot of cars before building my own," he said.
"You've competed, and you carry it through a lot of rigorous things, and it doesn't break," he continued. "A race car should be a low-budget, low-funding thing that you can enjoy."
According to Jones, "A racing car makes you no money. It takes money. To race a car like an Audi, and it gets damaged, it takes you so much to put it back together. If you have a home-built car, you can go just about anywhere and find and replace a part."
He was quick to raise the point that "you cannot just go buy a $10 million car and scrap it. Let's face it, you have a $10 million car, just came from the showroom, nothing other than the chassis is good for racing. You have to get rid of everything - interior, carpet, roof lining, seatbelts - and then you have to rebuild the car inside out."
His advice: "Buy a cheap car that you can just modify and do what you have to do. Low-budget racing also helps entry-level people because the 'young blood' coming in can't afford to get any sponsors to buy them a car for $10 million when the sponsors don't even know them. We need to get back to the grass-roots level where a person can just come on in, see what is happening, like it, and jump on board."
So far, the ambitious racer has competed at Dover, Jamwest, and Vernamfield with the same engine he built in 2006.
He mentioned, however, "I made some changes to the car about three years ago, where I dismantled the car. I took all four fenders off, and I cut the car because I wanted it to be a little wider. I added sheet metal to the fenders - put two inches spread on it - so the car now looks like a Lancia Integrale with the wider fenders on it."
Jones said that he is motivated by his peers, especially Maurice Whitnam, who gave him the push he needed. He recalled, "He was saying to me, 'Well, I know you can do it, but you're just reluctant to do it, so let me do it for you.' Because I didn't want him doing it for me, I started trying to beat him to the punch, trying to get it done, and it was a success, and it looks that way because of Mr Maurice Whitnam trying to jump in to do it for me."
Although racing his own invention has been fulfilling, Jones is aware of how much more he could do with one important addition.
"A lack of sponsorship means you have to work within your budget," he lamented. "I would compete more if that were forthcoming. Now, I minimise the competition based off my budget.
"This car has a fan base where even Jeffrey Panton envies the crowd-following of this car," he said. "People are getting to know that this car is a force to be reckoned with and that it is (built by) a person who wouldn't give up and won't give up because he's here to enjoy himself. At the end of the day, you have to enjoy it to stay in it. That's the key thing."

Minister without Portfolio in the Ministry of Finance and the Public Service Fayval Williams says for the 2017/ 2018 fiscal year Tax Administration Jamaica (TAJ) performed above expectations, topping the agency's forecast.
“For the period, the TAJ collected $307 billion, surpassing estimates by $9.2 billion or 3.2 per cent. If you look at the prior fiscal year, 2016/2017, tax revenues were $284 billion, coming from $264 billion in 2015/2016,” she noted.
Speaking at a TAJ-hosted Transfer Pricing Agreement Seminar, held at the Hibiscus Lodge Hotel in Ocho Rios, St Ann on Thursday Williams said tax collection continues to see tremendous improvements as a result of the tax authority’s actions to encourage compliance.
“The TAJ’s efforts to strengthen enforcement capabilities and government’s shift from direct to indirect taxation continue to work hand in hand to propel the country’s growth in tax revenues,” she noted.
Williams pointed out that Jamaica received a largely compliant rating earlier this year, up from a partially compliant rating a year ago in 2017, based on its adherence to the exchange of information on request principle.
Meanwhile, Williams said Jamaica is benefiting significantly from the introduction of the Transfer Pricing Agreement tax regime.
Parliament made amendments to the Income Tax Act in 2015 to introduce the transfer pricing regime, in keeping with best practices adopted by several tax administrations worldwide and based on international standards and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) rules.
According to the TAJ, transfer pricing is the general term for the pricing of property (including property, plant, equipment, goods, and intangibles) or services in cross-border and domestic transactions between connected persons.
Minister Williams said the Transfer Pricing Agreement is among various initiatives now being employed by TAJ to improve tax compliance and promote transparency.
