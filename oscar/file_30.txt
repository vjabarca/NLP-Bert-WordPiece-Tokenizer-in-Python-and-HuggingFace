Roger that. The foster family that raised my father didn’t get electricity on their farm until I was about 7-8 years old. I remember visiting them when I was small and sitting in a living room lighted by kerosene (made from oil) lamps, and listening to a radio powered by a car battery. They also cooked using a wood stove, and kept their milk cool in a tank of cold water from their well.
But even though they didn’t have electricity to their house and barn, they did have a car and a tractor fueled by gasoline — and considered them essential.
Yet there are billions who don’t enjoy modern civilization or electricity and yet their populations are propped up by oil.
I think the problem is that you need to get out more; see the world. See how people live around the world. Go to Africa. You will see the difference in modern civilization and life-sustaining.
I suspect I have a much better grasp on the global energy situation than you do, and my opinion is that you are simply uninformed. To be honest, I am shocked that you brought it back up, but that’s your hang-up and I really can’t help you there. But I can assure you that you haven’t budged me an inch off of my point. I know I am right. So you should probably drop it and move on instead of simply repeating your earlier claims.
As others pointed out before, it’s apples and oranges in any case. Electricity is an energy carrier, and we make plenty of electricity without fossil fuels. So let’s say all fossil fuels vanished tomorrow. We would still be able to produce electricity at about a third of today’s rate. So while you might not have Internet, critical industries could continue to operate.
But the plant operators wouldn’t be able to get to work, because lack of oil would shut down the entire global transportation infrastructure. Not only would you not be able to get to the store, the food wouldn’t be able to get to the store, and the yields of the food that did get into the market would plummet as indicated by the Kansas corn farmer in the story.
Please explain how my father’s foster parents (see my above post at 12:35 pm) were able to live without electricity well into the 1950s.
Have you ever heard of the TVA? (Tennessee Valley Authority) Before the TVA started building dams on the Tennessee River in the 1930s and 1940s, most of the people living in the Tennessee Valley had no electricity. By today’s standards their lives were hard, but they didn’t die.
I have already exlained this to him, as well as the fact that billions live today without electricity (but not without fossil fuels). So his point is demonstrably invalid. It’s like arguing with a fence post, except in addition to not listening or acknowledging the points, the fence post just repeats same refuted points.
He seems to be unable to differentiate between electricity supporting our modern lifestyles and oil keeping most of Africa alive — even though they are mostly without electricity. Yes, life without electricity would be harsh. No Internet, no microwaves, no air conditioning. 30 days of that would be unpleasant. 30 days without oil? People would be dropping like flies.
Or, you could stop eating anything that was brought to you via oil, and completely give up oil-based transportation. After 30 days, you wouldn’t be able to call back.
Sounds like she learned lots, from a small start, about just how all pervasive energy use is – I don’t think there are many who would argue that.
As for renewable energy, it will continue to find its niches to become sustainable business (as micro hydro, anaerobic digestion have done), but I think to say it will dethrone fossil energy/ the powers that be is a bit of a stretch. Renewable energy can play in the same game, but it is a long way from being anything other than a minor player.
The examples of the green buildings are not necessarily examples of the way forward. Many of these ‘flagship”green buildings are so expensive to build, that they merely prove that most people/companies can’t afford to build them. The New Orleans houses are another example, they are built to be flood and hurricane proof, but at such a cost that the only way those people can ever have them is if they are donated – but how scalable is that? Despite decades of development, countless demonstration projects etc, “green building” in the form most hyped in the media is simply expensive, complicated luxury that few people and businesses can afford. It is not sustainable if it is not affordable.
To say that filling up at the local gas station is more important than hundreds of dollars worth of food rotting in your fridge borders on the absurd.
Sounds like another clueless journalist trying to sell a book. Everyone is an ‘environmentalist’ but none of them base ideas about the environment on reality. Take for example the idea of ‘green’ buildings.
“She told the story of a new home owner whose energy bills had dropped from $500 a month to under $100 a month in her new home.”
First, I suppose you can find a few drafty old houses that heat with oil to achieve returns like that. Maybe I could save $50/month on my electricity for my 30 year old house compared to a new house built with all the practical energy saving ideas.
Just for the record the good place to go is your electric utility’s web site for ideas. It is free too.
Second, if you measure air quality in a tightly sealed house I am not sure how ‘green’ you would call it. Indoor air quality and radon issues are the result of conservation.
Third, if the building is all electric, reducing energy is not ‘green’ if the energy is produced without environmental impact. Since we do not use oil to make much electricity, we can skip oil issues. I maintain that producing electricity in the US has insignificant environment impact. Putting the pollution controls at the power plant is a lot easier than in buildings. I would suggest that using a little more electricity to reduce mold and mildew improves our living standard.
At least in all electric homes, reducing your standard of living by using less energy will not improve the environment. Enjoy!
Straw man. Those people without electricity don’t have fridges; but they do have food. It isn’t rotting food in your fridge that will kill you. In fact, I can eat fine without even owning a fridge. It’s the growing of the food and moving it that is the problem you don’t seem to grasp.
It is also a grotesque strawman to suggest that what you would give up by giving up oil is filling up at your local gas station. What you would give up are the majority of the world’s crop yields and the ability to transport what remains. Your response to these points has only been “BS” or “Nonsense.” So far there is zero substantive response as to how you would feed 7 billion people without oil or natural gas. But don’t worry, I don’t expect that you can offer one, so “BS” it is.
I presume you’re also excluding coal, since it’s easily if expensively substituted for oil/gas in most of those critical applications. Excluding all fossils, things are harder but not impossible. The key feedstock for nitrogen fertiliser is actually hydrogen, which we can produce inefficiently from electricity or somewhat more efficiently via thermal processes. In principle we can therefore use nuclear or solar power to meet those needs. Plastics and other chemicals I believe we could derive from biomass sources – there is at least no law-of-physics reason why this can’t work, and the scale is much smaller than transport.
If you buy the foregoing, that brings us back to transport. For long-haul transport it seems possible to use nuclear-powered ships and electrically-powered trains. Yes, it would take longer to get anywhere, but going back to 1920s travel times isn’t the same as the end of civilisation. Arguably we’re better off since telepresence can make up for at least some of the loss. Short-haul goods transport and personal transport remain problematic, as well as applications such as heavy equipment, farm machinery, etc. Vehicle electrification has potential for some portion of personal transport, with estimates as high as 80%. Could the rest (heavy machinery, short-haul trucking, and busses) be within striking distance of our ability to produce biodiesel? What about biomass enriched with hydrogen to produce energy-rich liquid fuels? It doesn’t seem impossible.
I presume you’re also excluding coal, since it’s easily if expensively substituted for oil/gas in most of those critical applications. Excluding all fossils, things are harder but not impossible.
Doug, in the longer term we can make enormous changes if we absolutely had to, and many things would be possible (but as you say, likely much more expensive).
My point is that at present a large fraction of the world’s population is fed, clothed, and housed by oil. That is the status quo. If oil and natural gas disappeared tomorrow, billions of people would die in less than six months. Of course oil and natural gas won’t disappear tomorrow, but it makes me very uneasy to think about so much of the population being so dependent on our declining reserves of fossil fuels.
Did that and you can keep transportation by jet. For those are concerned, can stop worrying about about not having electricity except for a short period of time. We are too good to let that happen. Listening to RR I might be a little concerned about oil and gas but I suspect most in the industry are too busy getting the job to let it happen.
What I am worried about is the next essay about journalists who need a short outage to learn that they depend on energy.
The oil companies can manipulate global oil prices via the futures market, which require no oil supply in order to be manipulated. This is especially true if you believe that the crude futures prices are often led by products futures, especially (ICE) gas oil and (NYMEX) heating oil futures, which are much shallower markets than the main (NYMEX/ICE) crude oil futures markets. They surely play a role in the futures markets; whether they make concerted efforts to control price is an open question. (Apparently CEOs tend to refrain from discussing price for fear of prosecution.)
There are a number of things that can be done, but most of them require a paradigm shift. Examples: http://www.thenaturalhome.com covers a house design that is fully self heating or cooling over 95% of the continental US at less than the cost of a standard house – but it doesn’t look like a house to us. Annualized geo solar can provide heating except in swamps or solid rock, but is about 10% more expensive. A new house is too expensive for most people, tho. Personally, I’m blowing summer air through the basement – cheap cooling and the soil temperature has risen enough that the pipes don’t freeze in midwinter anymore. Also the south roof is being stiffened, so that when solar PVT becomes inexpensive enough, this century old house can use it. Per food, read books by John Jeavons, Andre Poisson, Eliot Coleman, Mel Bartholomew, & others. Of course, this needs us to work at raising and preserving our own food, but productivity is very high. Been using these methods for thirty years, very effective. Travel & transporting goods are a problem, but look up the J-pod system, electrified railroads, etc.
RR has it right, and maybe Little does also – as fossil fuel prices rise, renewables and alternatives will become competitive, but changes will not be minor.
While it is possible to do things like what you say to a free standing house, what about the millions that live in city condos and apartments? They have no means to do any of that, and they keep space available for others to do that, because they are no consuming space themselves.
Cities function very well at keeping large numbers of people in a relatively small area, as long as they are supplied with inputs – which are produced efficiently by farms outside them. There is no amount of backyard gardening that can produce any significant fraction of NYC’s food needs. If everyone tries to live in a detached country hosues with garden all around, the sprawl will beciome immense.
In fact, it is exactly this desire to live in a country house, but in the city, that has led to American sprawl in the first place, even before cars were invented;
There are also millions of tons of methane frozen in the clathrate hydrates under the oceans. Difficult to get at and extract, but in a crunch, it’s there for the taking.
The Japanese are one of the only countries that has been working on ways to use them. Just might come in handy as a way to replace the nuclear power they’ve lost.
That looks just like where my grandparents on Main Street. Looks like the church where I was baptized. Different town but what are the chances there is an Elm Street, Mill Road, and Canal Street?
Everyplace has a history. The small farms, the mill near running water, the Erie Canal to move the corps to NYC. Freedom was not about commuting from the factory in the city. Freedom was about migrating west for new opportunities.
WWII and the GI Bill changed how how we live in the US. The small town where I was born has not changed. It is just like I remember except they rebuilt the grade school. Great place to raise kids.
Of course I understand why my dad moved to Seattle. The availability of provided new choices but most of America is still small town that is not sprawl.
No Wendell ‘methane frozen in the clathrate hydrates’ is not an energy source. Could it be an energy source if we run out of coal and fissionable material? Since we are not going to run out of the latter, who cares.
As Wendell likes to point out the only thing holding back ‘methane frozen in the clathrate hydrates’ is the corn lobby and special interest groups.
Japan will import more coal and LNG in the short term. Then they will build more new nukes, putting them on higher ground. They could import corn from Iowa too. Unlike ‘methane frozen in the clathrate hydrates’ burning corn for energy is something people actually do.
@ Walt, thank you and I agree that the Open Fuel Standard is a good thing. Especially for methanol, it will bring it into the mix as an oxygenate and hopefully a mixed alcohol standalone fuel as well. Mark, I assume you are also supportive of this because of your Montana mixed alcohol product produced using beetle kill biomass as a feedstock?
@ Mac, let’s try this another way. Even though I hate repeating this because I feel like it is reiterated all the time at any event energy related…
The problem we are talking about is the strategic value of oil. Electricity is not a strategic commodity, because it can be made from a variety of sources. The US is completely dependent on oil for 96% of our transportation, yet we only have 3% of the world’s oil reserves. Most of that oil comes from petro dictatorships that are hostile and want to eliminate the US. In essence, we are paying for both sides of the wars that we are currently fighting. Contrarily, with electricity, we are not only much more diversified, though 50% of electricity produced in the US comes from coal, at least we domestically produce ALL of the electricity that the US uses right here in the US.
With oil, especially in regard to transportation, there are currently no viable alternatives available in commercial quantities. Ethanol is the only thing making a small dent at 13 billion gallons produced in the US last year. In contrast, US biodiesel production was about 350 million gallons… This is why it is so important that we diversify our transportation sector off of oil.
I didn’t say that — or even infer that. The main problem with methane clathrates is the difficulty of getting to them and getting the methane out –more difficult than what we have to now do to get oil from the deep ocean.
But it is there in quantities that would solve our energy problems for a long time — if we ever have the technology, will, and need to go after it.
There is one other big problem: The environmentalists don’t want us to tap into the frozen methane under the oceans. They want the carbon in that methane to stay right where it is. So even had we the technology to use it, politics might not permit it.
Mark, I assume you are also supportive of this [Open Fuels Standard bill] because of your Montana mixed alcohol product produced using beetle kill biomass as a feedstock?
Yes Sir! Mandating that all new vehicles sport a (adjustable?) FFV chip which allows motorists to choose gasoline, methanol, ethanol (or other stronger BTU alcohols???) makes a lot of sense. And this Federal Statute being presently discussed should cover imported cars as well as autos and pickups produced domestically.
I’ve previously posted here that I believe very cheap factory FFV chips should become standard automotive equipment. Why should it take a Federal Law to implement this? Why wouldn’t Detroit’s Big Three jump into this voluntarily? We are only talking here of a $35 Flexible Fuel Vehicle chip plus elastomer & fuel system compatibility with alcohols (maybe another $100 max). This should be a no brainer. FFV technology is more than 25 years old… If domestic Energy Policy is in any way attempting to prepare for Peak Oil while simultaneously working to import less Crude Oil from other parts of the world – just seamlessly adding C1 methanol OR C1-C10 higher mixed alcohols into the general fuel pool along with C5-C10 hydrocarbon gasoline and C2 corn ethanol makes perfect sense.
Oxycarbon Methanol features 56,000 BTU’s / gallon. It fueled the Indy 500 Race Cars for 37 years until being politically replaced by EtOH about 4-5 years ago. Corn Ethanol provides 75,500 BTU’s and Higher Mixed Alcohols features at least 90,400 BTU’s and 130+ octane. Most gasoline provides 112,000+ BTU’s.
The Open Fuels Standard bill requires 95 percent of cars to be capable of burning gasoline, ethanol, and methanol in any combination by 2017. So each car will be capable of burning any and all of these liquid fuels. Or the car could be electric, hydrogen, natural gas, bio-diesel, or any other non-gasoline-burning car. The bill is being referred to as the all-of-the-above option, or a technology-neutral bill, meaning that it doesn’t favor any particular option, but allows the market to decide where innovation can lead.
Carbonaceous feedstocks to cleanly produce C1 Methanol or C1-C10 higher mixed alcohol ENVIROLENE® via GTL (gas-to-liquids catalytic synthesis) go far beyond beetle-killed pine trees – yet there are millions of acres of these standing dead pine trees available PLUS out of work foresters ready to harvest them for the next 35+ years… In western Montana, we’ve been discussing $50/ton for pine chips delivered to central sites against the railroad… This harvesting technique would be a little bit different – same foresters would become Johnny Appleseed too — and replant seedlings as they covered their tracks in these eco-damaged forests. This increases costs beyond $50/ton for pine chips – yet it will still pencil – and it is the right thing to do – even when Montana coal might be purchased for $35/ton and provide 1/4 more BTU’s per unit volume.
All of these solids or gasses provide those Carbon atom building blocks as basic feedstock to produce new oxycarbon alcohols which blend with gasoline in any volume c/o $35 factory-installed FFV chips. The basic Carbon atoms tow along little Hydrogen ions in their magnetic valence and the missing and key Oxygen atom which converts float-on-water Hydrocarbons into water soluble, oil soluble, coal soluble, biodegradable fuel alcohols – comes from H2O water. Not rocket science here! Yet not easily understood by the consuming public, NIMBY’s or most of our elected representatives!!!
Oh, I almost forgot! None of the above list of carbonaceous alcohol fuel feedstocks needs to be planted, fertilized, copiously watered, weeded nor annually harvested on premium or marginal lands. Let’s grow food instead!!!
Carbon is carbon is carbon as a liquid fuel building block. Switching to super-heated steam as a continous THERMAL front-end process driver instead of using acid enzymes and biobug yeasts via batch to batch cooking, fermention and expensive distillation — will soon catch on! Joe Sixpack and others really have no clue. Simply examine today’s newest IPO’s in biofuels as evidence of how little people actually understand as they open their wallets hoping for new fuel miracles. And then there are those promoting Ethanol & other Green Chemicals… Wonder what these other Green Chemicals could possible be? Anybody know?
After being pending for over six years, Australia recently accepted SACA’s higher mixed alcohol formula-usage patents and Oz now accompanies Mexico as the 2nd foreign country. I’ve been informed that Canada is next. We’ll see. Still waiting on China, India, Japan, Hong Kong and 29 countries of the European Union where the same PCT formulations have been pending for over six years…
The U.S. is not going to replace gasoline with a new liquid fuel(s) for a number of reasons. Building a new distribution infrastructure is expensive and has to compete with the existing gasoline distribution. The consumer has collectively shrugged at E85 and the prospects for other fuels are no better if not worse. FFV compatibility is not a selling point for Detroit and, more importantly FFV drivers don’t think about ethanol unless there is gasoline price spike. The coffee shop crowd pushes technological advancement in this country (see smart phones and tablet pcs), they have a definite bias against liquids fuels. The performance characteristics of the electric engine (instant torque) will add to its appeal/marketability.
I’ve previously posted here that I believe very cheap factory FFV chips should become standard automotive equipment. Why should it take a Federal Law to implement this? Why wouldn’t Detroit’s Big Three jump into this voluntarily? We are only talking here of a $35 Flexible Fuel Vehicle chip plus elastomer & fuel system compatibility with alcohols (maybe another $100 max). This should be a no brainer.
I think this would be a great thing, but wonder how it would work at the retail level. I can’t see gasoline retailers putting in infrastructure to sell gasoline, ethanol, methanol, and mixed alcohols. So how do you envision that this would go down? Entirely separate retailers for (e.g.) methanol? Or some retailers who only sell gasoline and mixed alcohols, or only mixed alcohols?
Excellent clip. I have to check her out in a bit more depth. I knew the name, but not really the things she stands for. Quite similar to my own views, from what I saw in that clip.
When considering the importance of energy on our daily lives, looking at life expectancy is interesting.
Smoking and being an alcoholic significantly reduce life expectancy. Again no surprise. To the heart of the matter, if energy allows us to be more productive and proserous:
“One of the greatest risks to an individual is living in poverty: LLE is 9 years for 19 large U.S. cities and for Montreal.”
“Some significant environmental problems for the average American, according to very rough EPA estimates, include air pollution (40 days), drinking water pollution (20 days), chemical residues in food (20 days), and chemicals released from consumer products (20 days). News media give wide publicity to cancer-causing pollutants. Some of these are pesticide residues in food (12 days), tobacco smoke (8 days), other indoor pollutants (2 days), industrial air pollution (4 days), hazardous waste sites (2.5 days), and drinking water contaminants (1.3 days).”
“Great concern has been expressed about health impacts from our use of energy. TheLLEfrom various components are: coal burning, 15 days; oil burning, 5 days; natural gas, 3 days (mostly from asphyxiation); hydroelectric dam failures, 0.2 days; and nuclear power, 0.06 days.”
“The solution often proposed to avoid these risks is conservation  using less energy. But this has its own risks with substantial LLE, for example: using smaller automobiles, 60 days; greatly reducing air leakage in buildings thereby increasing levels of indoor air pollution, 50 days; doubling use of bicycles, 6 days; and reduced lighting, 11 days if it causes 5 percent more automobile accidents, 5 days if it results in 5 percent more murders, and 1.5 days if it leads to 5 percent more falls.”
“This middle group consists mostly of risks widely recognized but not greatly feared. The lowest risk in this middle group, bicycles (the most dangerous transport per mile traveled),”
The important thing to remember about risk is that it can be managed. You can chose the route, for example, that you ride a bicycle to work avoid heavy traffic and associated pollution.
RR: I do not envision any additional NEW gasoline station infrastructure than it takes to presently retail E-85. If a FFV chip were to feature a motorist glove-box calibration setting – then a new FFV chip can automatically adjust for different oxygen and BTU contents contained in C1 Methanol/gasoline or C2 Ethanol/gasoline or C1-C10 E4™ Higher Mixed Alcohols/gasoline blends.
The service station pumps WHATEVER flex fuel blend it can get its hands on. And the motorist’s car or pickup simply runs this flex fuel gasoline / alcohol blend at 10% to 85% volume percentages. Of course, the price for different alcohol/gasoline blends would vary according to the total BTU’s/Octane being delivered to the consumer. Yet a new FFV chip would handle at least three different fuel blends and could also be programmed for neat alcohols as well without any gasoline content whatsoever…
The trick here is to pre-program the NEW FFV chip installed at the factory. Methanol at 56,000 BTU’s features 50% oxygen. Ethanol at 75,500 BTU’s contains 33% oxygen content. E4™ ENVIROLENE® higher mixed alcohols at 90,400 BTU’s contains 34% oxygen content. A standard FFV chip today is calibrated only for C2 Ethanol which would feature 33% oxygen content in the neat fuel. And the chip ‘reads’ dissolved oxygen in the gasoline/alcohol blend. So the chip therein first adjusts air/fuel ratio squirts from the fuel injector. THEN the spark ignition timing is next automatically forwarded WAAAYYY upwards to compensate for much higher octane in all of these fuel alcohols — and this is where the extra-punch to the accelerator pedal comes from plus drastic reductions in exhaust emissions.
So IF the motorist sets a glove-box switch for Methanol or Ethanol or much stronger BTU E4™ Higher Mixed Alcohols – everything else becomes automatic after that point. The chip ‘knows’ what BTU value alcohol is providing “x” percentage content of oxygen dissolved into the alcohol/gasoline mixture. Of course, the retail price would differ if M-85 were pumped out of the flex-fuel nozzle in comparison to E-85 or E4™-95.
Presumably, SACA or licensors would initially market C1-C10 higher mixed alcohol E4™ ENVIROLENE® at the same wholesale rack price as anhydrous C2 Ethanol. At least for a year or so. Then we’d expect refiners to pay fair market price for 20% stronger BTU’s and 30 more octane points than C2 Ethanol provides. One step at a time. http://www.dtnprogressivefarme….._PAGE_FREE
The service station pumps WHATEVER flex fuel blend it can get its hands on. And the motorist’s car or pickup simply runs this gasoline / alcohol blend at 10% to 85% volume percentages. Of course, the price for different alcohol/gasoline blends would vary.
CB: The consumer wants/needs standardization and is willing to pay for it. Companies like McDonald’s, Proctor and Gamble, and Coke spend billions to ensure their products taste/perform the same despite where their customers are buying them. Its boring, but people like buying “brands”. The kind of fuel regionalism you’re calling for seems unlikely in such an established sector of the economy. In new consumer product industries, there is an initial race to define “the standard”. Then, the remaining firms compete within this definition (e.g. social networking, smart phones, polo shirts). If there is going to be an alternative fuel revolution (I doubt this) there will be one clear winner. Car manufacturers/ dealers want to say “Our car gets “X” mpg” not ”Your mileage may vary and you’ll need to adjust this dial depending upon your choice of fuel ”
I think you’re also overestimating the flexbility of the service station. Can an E85 tank-pump just be switched to methanol? The station is going to have to cast its alternative fuel lot.
Furthermore, what motivation does a station have to “get its hands on” an alt fuel (unless there is a legal mandate)? The only reason to sell any liquid fuel is to get customers to buy higher margin items. Gas stations are going to continue to be ambivalent on alt fuels unless they bring in more foot traffic.
Well, the idea here is that the engine management system does the standardisation, to get similar performance and efficiency out of any of these fuels – this is quite achievable by the methods Mark described. In fact, on the alcohols, the thermal efficiency in miles per btu will be better, as they are inherently better fuels for a gasoline ICE.
Remember, Coke etc substituted HFCS for sugar, first partially, then completely, and no one really noticed (until they started getting diabetes, anyway)
So, if the engine does the standardisation, and the consumer is confident in the engine (because the car companies have throughly tested/developed/warrantied them) then the question then becomes, is the consumer willing to use the alt fuels, and pay less for them? The Brazil examples, where many cars can run on anything from E20 to E100, suggests they will.
Many people have cars that can run on premium or regular gasoline, and run better on premium, but choose to run them on regular unleaded, just because it is cheaper. They will trade the 1 sec increase in 0-60 time for 5% less $/mile. If they are then towing something, they will spend the extra on that trip for premium for the extra performance – I know one guy who does just that.
Car manufacturers/ dealers want to say “Our car gets “X” mpg” not ”Your mileage may vary and you’ll need to adjust this dial depending upon your choice of fuel ”
Yes they do want to say that, but for many customers these days, they want to save $. The car will adjust for the fuel automatically, and for working out the equivalent mileage, well, “there will be an app for that”, so that you don’t have to trust the car dealer!
I think you’re also overestimating the flexbility of the service station. Can an E85 tank-pump just be switched to methanol?
Absolutely, as long as the pump can handle methanol in the first place, it can handle all the rest. A new fuel type (e.g. methanol/mixed alcohol, E85) can be stored in an above ground tank, at places that have the space (e.g. rural stations)- the fuel provider might even provide said tank – that’s what Coke does with its fridges.
A tight station in an inner city location would be different, but just because you can;t do it everywhere, right away, doesn’t mean you can;t do it at all.
The independent gas stations have been the fastest adopters of E85 (with the possible exception of Valero, who now own 10% of US ethanol capacity), and I expect they would be the fastest adopters of any other alt fuels too. When you have alternate suppliers of alternate fuels, you have some supplier competition that doesn’t really exist today. They will have to finds ways to make the retailers want to sell their product – making it more profitable do so would be the best way. the independent retailers have this ability – an Exxon owned stn does not.
With the current public attitude towards the big oil cos, I expect that – to be able to buy an alt fuel, from a retailer who is not big oil, that is cheaper, and that your runs on just fine – will be quite attractive to many people.
And if all new cars can handle it, the change is enabled, and it is up to the drivers to decide which fuel they will buy. Personally, I don’t think they will pay more, to Big Oil, for “standardisation”. I actually think they will pay a little more to be free from Big Oil, and if they can do it while paying less, well, anything could happen.
She gave this talk entitled “Energy Security” on C-Span – to the 30th National Conservative Student Conference on Aug. 4, 2008. The film is 1 hour 5 minutes long.
There is also a three (3) part film called: “Turning Salt into Oil” along with a number of other shorter video excerpts on You Tube featuring Ann Kurin
Sorry. The lady’s name is actually Anne Korin (not Kurin) and the film she is in is named after her book titled: “Turning Oil Into Salt”
I wish every American would be forced to read this book, or one like it, in high school. Where I live, fracking is HUGE drama right now, and I can not count how many times people have called into the radio to say things like, ‘we should not be using natural gas and oil since we have renewables’. Thank God I do not know these people in real life, because I have absolutely no words for such remarks.
RR, I do not understand how you can continue to say things like ‘the population will fall to under 2 billion without oil’ and NOT be a complete doomer. Some day oil will in fact leave us, so some generation will have to experience doom, no? Or do you believe we will slowly shift away from it as new technology becomes available OR we somehow undergo a gradual population decline? Perhaps you just do not believe in doom for yourself and children? Sorry for all the questions, just trying to wrap my mind around your way of thinking. As a parent, these are questions I think about daily, try as I might not to. Such is life
The consumer has collectively shrugged at E85 and the prospects for other fuels are no better if not worse.
True they have, but during a time when oil is abundant. I’m going to guess if it’s a choice between using ‘xyz’ to fuel your car or doing without, the majority will choose using xyz. Now we just have to figure out if there actually is an xyz.
I’m going to guess if it’s a choice between using ‘xyz’ to fuel your car or doing without, the majority will choose using xyz
Well put. If there was another 1973 style embargo, and rationing on gasoline was imposed, but not E85, I wonder what would happen?
It’s probably safe to say that quite a few people would put E85 into their non flex fuel vehicles, rather than do without. This, of course, is in contravention of the EPA vehicle emissions regulations – but given they don’t really enforce them today, they probably wouldn’t then.
RR, I do not understand how you can continue to say things like ‘the population will fall to under 2 billion without oil’ and NOT be a complete doomer.
That’s not what I said. I said that if oil disappeared today, we would certainly see a multi-billion person die-off. I have no doubt about that. So this is a risk hanging over us. Fortunately, oil isn’t going to disappear today, and I believe that we can make some tough sacrifices and avoid these terrible scenarios.
Note that I am not predicting this; I am just pointing out the status quo. I have said many times that I really don’t know what the sustainable carrying capacity of the earth may be, but I know at present that most of it is propped up by fossil fuels. That situation can’t last forever, so either we adjust accordingly or Mother Nature solves the problem.
It would be wonderful if you could do any research on Ms. Korin and the organizations behind her efforts. When I first saw the Open Fuel Standards Act website last week, I could not have been more pleased. Then as I dug deeper my joy turned into sorrow. I will not expand.
Let’s say that when the Methanol Institute became largely the lead sponsor and they represent to two largest importers of Methanol into America, I do not see any way we should shift our “crude oil” imports to “methanol imports”, but this is exactly what is going to happen. I have worked in this methanol sector for more than 5 years, and it is absolutely controlled by Methanex and several importers. You think OPEC is evil and should be hated by every American, that is fine for those who want to teach and preach this doctrine. However, I am not convinced turning over the blending into the hands of Methanex and a few importers is the best option for America.
I agree we need choice at the pumps, but I would rather encourage everyone to understand why those of us who produce methanol here in America are having such a difficult time getting any support.
1) New technologies are by their nature difficult to implement without money, and methanol has been bad news in America due to this controversy here over many years:
2) Unless you build jumbo scale plants in America, you will not compete with Methanex and other cheap importers. Thus, what is being argued as a way to eliminate crude oil imports with the replacement of methanol imports makes little “American” sense…but it will be politically correct in DC to support political forces working behind closed doors. I understand this is how the system works.
3) I wrote to their new website, but only before I realized who was behind the effort. I do not expect any response now that I realize what is behind this new push. I was really hoping for an independent organization who supported American companies trying to create American jobs with allowing access to these consumers. This legislation will be create the access to consumers at the pumps, but it will come from methanol imports as there is no way that ethanol can compete without subsidies.
I really hope you will try to do what you can to be independant in your evaluation of this legislation and see if it will be good for consumers, and as a means to eliminate foreign crude oil imports due to the alleged OPEC evil controlling America. I wonder how much oil is imported by traders and bankers in America rather than OPEC countries directly? What countries actually deliver crude to America and control distribution? I guess I know the answer. Beyond the hype, what does it mean to replace crude oil imports with methanol imports?
Mark, I would not leave it to the Open Fuel Standards Act passage to insure access to these consumers for either mixed alcohols or domestically produced methanol. In the last two meetings I’ve had with those working directly with the station owners, once before this legislation was brought back into front and center on the political agenda and once after it was resubmitted, I see now much more clearly what is in the works. I think we should not be blinded by the press releases and press statements without doing more research on who is behind the legislation and why.
Again, let me be 100% clear as I know I will get some nasty emails from my posting on this blog. I’m very supporting of giving consumers choice at the pumps. However, I recognize that the ethanol lobby has worked tirelessly to get into the gasoline pool with their 10% and 15% mandates. Beyond the problems caused with small engines, which I learned recently are really not effecting all engines except the oldest ones, I expect the chance for domestically produced methanol and mixed alcohols will not make it to the consumer. We are not talking about producing crude oil or natural gas in America. These are commodities…bought and sold daily…and can be hedged against price risk. Methanol and Mixed Alcohols are not traded outside a small group of importers and foreign producers. There is a major rush right now as I hear in consolidation by the major brand name companies to buy up stations, or consolidate the market.
While it is possible we will get access to the pump from a general market press statement, I think our best shot is the fleet industry. Your fuel has the best chance to get into fleets and win the hearts of the drivers and mechanics. Methanol does not have the great of chance, although, I do believe there will be opportunities. It will all depend on the lowest price domestically to compete with importers. Prices even in the oil fields now are still less than $1.50 per gallon. It means one has to be selling locally at $1.25-$1.30 per gallon to take those supply contracts.
Look at the history of methanol prices. They are low now, but they went to $850 a ton just before the economic crises of 2008. Even during this years maintenance schedule they kept prices very low…perhaps out of demand problems, but I suspect they were planning to bring back to life the Open Fuel Standards Act and with the Methanol Institute taking the lead role I imagine nobody wants to see $850/ton methanol. People argue that methanol is tied to natural gas prices, so if natural gas is low so are methanol prices. This is not true necessarily true. Methanol prices are tied to crude oil prices. Here is a good explanation…although you can find many on the web.
So depending on how you view methanol imports, and how you consider mixed alcohol pricing index, I would not believe the press when they argue that low natural gas prices guarantee low methanol prices from Methanex and other importers. The only way I can guarantee fixed priced, low cost methanol is to own the gas fields, or fix the natural gas prices with the supplier. Not attractive for investors if the future price of methanol can go to $850 per ton with crude oil prices…or demand at the gasoline pump.
“Thank God I do not know these people in real life, because I have absolutely no words for such remarks. ”
I can tell from experience that they are against specific renewable energy projects in their backyard. My wife and I were invited to a pot luck because of out interest in renewable energy and the environment. We watched an old black and white movie that was pure communist propaganda out of the Stalin era. Workers unite and all that. Apparently the way to save the planet it to live a dreary life and eat boiled cabbage.
Prosperous capitalists want clean air and water. The marginal coast of producing energy cleanly and safely is low. It is just good business. If fact if you look at China and the USSR the cost of not doing it are high.
Pay less? Where are the alt fuels that are cheaper than gasoline? If its not cheaper people will pass as we’ve seen with ethanol. Standardizing a new class of compatibile fuels may be technically easy but marketing this to the consumer is complex. Brazil illustrates that there will be a clear alt fuel standard. In this case ethanol.
The independent gas stations have been the fastest adopters of E85 (with the possible exception of Valero, who now own 10% of US ethanol capacity), and I expect they would be the fastest adopters of any other alt fuels too.
Again this microrefinery concept seems unlikely. High capital costs, low relative output, and razor thin margins aren’t a good mix. Not to mention, your main competitors are the most profitable companies in the world. I don’t think gas stations will turn into bars, with drivers asking “What do you have on tap?” Beer is a (relatively) high margin refined product that is easy to produce and we see that in the product mix available, fuel is not.
Thomas, my research shows that almost all of them will handle up to about 15-25% alcohols at the pumps without further modifications. The installers I know of both pumps and tanks have made lots of changes since the introduction of 10% in the gasoline. I am told there was a lot of failures when they first were hit with the ethanol in the gasoline, but almost all of those fixes were completed. What I understand is that it is likely the current fixes could support maybe up to 25%, but nobody knows until they try.
The E85 or M85 blends absolutely cannot use current pumps. They need totally separate hardware. They pay now about $6,000 here in my part of Michigan to upgrade the pumps, and when current retailers are loosing money on gasoline to the tune of $0.01 to $0.02 per gallon due to the credit card charges and the price of buying gasoline from the jobbers and distributors (both still in the distribution chain for independents), it is really a absolute “no way” are they going to spend $6,000 per pump to upgrade to alcohol fuels at E85 or M85. The blenders credit never makes it down to the E85 pump/station, but stays with those far upstream of them. Figure out what a 3.5% credit card fee amounts to on $3.85-$4.50/gal gasoline, and you cannot blame these station owners to be complaining. Discover is higher yet, and AMEX is even higher than Discover.
The real value here is for Methanex to get cheap product into the mix and get to the consumer if they can deliver cheap methanol. You can find powerpoints by the Methanol Institute showing how cheap M85 would be at the pumps if Methanex can get in the door. If you take M85 and compete with E85 (with or without subsidies) you watch Methanex and other major producers balance sheet sky rocket. If you sell M85 at $2.50 per gallon while E85 is $4.00 and Gasoline is $4.25 don’t think Methanex will not be a winner in this deal. The consumer will win as well…as they rush to modify their engines with kits and line up for M85 like they do in China. The China example is working like hot cakes off the griddle. It does not work with ethanol, but they line up for methanol…and will continue as oil prices rise.
I agree it is good for consumers….they need a choice. However, I don’t want to hear all this mumbo jumbo about how many American jobs it is going to create, nor how it is going to eliminate crude oil imports and remove us from the grips of OPEC. Imported methanol or imported crude oil is going to be the issue with me…and this is only because I’m biased toward our own technology value. I hope when I’m labeled a hypocrite for promoting methanol and the open fuel standards act people realize it is because of our technology and our desire to get into the consumers. We absolutely cannot compete with Methanex…this I know. We cannot get press coverage from the Methanol Institute, and certainly there are some other methanol technologies that deserve attention coming into the market. I hope we can scale up fast and furious to get cheaper and cheaper methanol. It is one thing to claim you can make $3.44 algae oil, and cheap diesel fuel, jet fuel, etc. It is another thing to make $1.00 or less methanol in America to compete with importers.
Read the ADM/Methanex lawsuit. This battle is nothing new. Then look at China and their methanol industry. They will bring methanol to America and sell it at Wall Mart stores…just watch. It is all about scale of technology, access to the pumps and politics in Washington! Once you see who the players are behind the OFSA back on the books…it is politics at its finest…and some will argue if we don’t pass the legislation soon we will all be killed by terrorists and evil will be coming to every neighborhood until we pass that legislation to protect the American people. I don’t believe it, but call me hardened to the press releases and video’s on the topic.
I can tell from experience that they are against specific renewable energy projects in their backyard.
Part of it may be that, but it’s also the pure ignorance some people display by saying silly things such as, ‘we can add more wind power so we don’t need oil.’ I think that’s why so many people will have a hard time coping with a liquid fuels crisis, they seem to have this notion that all energy is currently interchangeable.
If you sell M85 at $2.50 per gallon while E85 is $4.00 and Gasoline is $4.25 don’t think Methanex will not be a winner in this deal. The consumer will win as well…as they rush to modify their engines with kits and line up for M85 like they do in China.
So are legal issues the only thing stopping Methanex from opening up stations to sell M85 and modify autos to run on it?
China and the U.S. competing to import the same transportation fuel has a familiar ring to it…. How do I go long on Methanol futures?
Thomas, you did say that consumers would pay a premium for “standardisation”, which means, by definition, that “unstandardised” is less.
If the alt fuels are cheaper, at least some will use them. The flex fuel drivers are a good example – many will not use E85 regardless of price, and others know the energy/price comparison, and will make their choice according to the pump price of the day.
Last month, wholesale methanol in the US was $1.28/gallon – that is the equivalent of wholesale gasoline at $2.60/gal, and the current price is $2.99.
Of course, once methanol starts being widely used as fuel, we can expect the gap to close, and it will likely track gasoline prices similar to how ethanol does.
Any benefit that might be gained by using methanol instead of oil, will be lost if the methanol is imported!
I do not know the answer to either question. I’m researching the first one now. What I learned today about the biodiesel market and how it is coming back to life has surprised me. I guess mandates will drive the price up of anything in short supply, and I now understand why someone gets high prices for algae jet fuel. When you have to buy it, like biodiesel now, things just take a profit life of their own.

In 2007, China firmly established itself as the driver of the global methanol industry. The country became the world’s largest methanol producer and consumer. China also leads the world in the use of methanol as an alternative transportation fuel blending nearly one billion gallons of methanol in gasoline. Taxi and bus fleets are running on high methanol blends (M-85 to M-100), and retail pumps sell low level blends (M-15 or less) in many parts of the country. Read more at: http://www.ensec.org/index.php…..Itemid=324
Walt: It seems that only a couple of years ago China quietly became the world’s largest producer of C1 MeOH. Before that, Canadian Methanex was apparently the largest giant in this global ‘chemical’ industry. Methanol is normally classified as a base chemical. In fact MeOH is the largest volume chemical sold on the planet today. MeOH is primarily used to make plastics, plastics, more plastics, paints, varnishes, thinners, etc. Methanol also powered the Indy 500 Race Cars as the choice “neat fuel” for 37 years until it was recently replaced by two-carbon corn Ethanol – obviously a political move.
What China is now accomplishing with Methanol as a gasoline oxygenating blendstock is rather incredible. This splash-blending technique with the world’s simplest and lowest cost ‘MeOH fuel alcohol’ could have been implemented 80-90 years ago anywhere on the globe — yet it was not. Who controls market monopolies enough to prevent the simplest, lowest cost fuel alcohol to make its way into automobile fuel tanks?
Today, amid present and very real climate changes, arbitrated Peak Oil volumes, Gulf Gusher oil spills, wars over oil, crude oil selling for $115+/bbl and NOW — civilian populations rioting against their dictators throughout the entire Middle Eastern oil producing region – while China quietly and effectively implements C1 MeOH into their public transportation system. China made the decision to build MeOH plants asap about four years ago to avoid food vs: fuel issues and NOT pursue batch fermentation to produce EtOH.
I find this new ‘Chinese Methanol implementation’ even more interesting because there is almost ZERO awareness of this fact by the U.S. public as all sorts of political rhetoric continues to be bantered about concerning food vs: fuel and subsidies provided to blenders splashing corn Ethanol into the domestic gasoline pool. On this blog we’ve previously experienced disinformation from shills concerning Methanol’s toxicity, etc… Now we hear views saying MeOH is NOT compatible with present day fueling systems… Maybe we need to simply ask what China is learning from their corner gasoline station setups? Or inquire about how older Chinese cars/trucks/small engines are performing when combusting these brand new methanol/gasoline blends.
Most motorists do not understand the differences between C1 Methanol and C2 [corn] Ethanol. These molecules are only ONE carbon atom different. Yet the feedstocks which produce them and the chemistry sets employed to formulate these two [lower] alcohols are as different as night and day. Both of these lower alcohols exhibit 107 or 108 octane yet their BTU’s are more separated at 56,000 and 75,500. [Repeat item from me on this blog.] MeOH features 50% oxygen concentration to EtOH’s 33% oxygen content.
We’ve previously discussed here the fact that when properly adjusted for air/fuel ratio and advanced spark ignition – that neat methanol performs even better than gasoline does when piston cylinder compression is advanced from typical 8.5 to 1 in gasoline ICE’s all the way up to 16 to 1 or even higher. The best ‘neat methanol or neat ethanol’ engine already exists. It is the standard high compression Diesel engine of today. The easiest factory retrofit would be to add spark ignition back to this same Diesel engine design as with all gasoline ICE’s of today.
As a motorist, I would certainly like to experience the increased engine torque of either MeOH or EtOH being cleanly combusted as a neat, substitute fuel in a modern-day Diesel engine. And as many folks might agree, following behind a large or small diesel truck on the highway which is now emitting a clean, biodegradable exhaust emission — would be preferable to inhaling uncombusted, sooty black diesel exhaust as we are all very familiar with. The next best thing here is to mandate FFV chips as standard equipment on new gasoline powered cars and light trucks.
Thus I am personally supportive of Methanol moving into America’s gasoline fuel pool as an effective oxygenate to compete with more expensive grain ethanol. And I support rapid and new Methanol volumes whether supplied by:
D) new Municipally-Owned Citizen Cooperatives choosing to recycle and cleanly gasifiy their own municipal solid waste products into profitable new volumes of biodegradable fuel alcohol(s).
Today – I’m glad that we are having some public discussion concerning the roots and viability [or not] of possible Federal Open Fuel Standard mandates to require simple, low-cost FFV chips installed in all new gasoline powered cars and trucks. Personally, I wish this were mainstream discussion tonight on CNN, Fox News and the traditional Radio & TV news networks. Joe & Jane Public ARE painfully aware of what $115 crude oil is doing to their family budget. They are more aware of this fact than they seem to be aware of their own tailpipe emission profiles OR the root cause today for multiple wars and Arab populations rioting on this planet.
Stronger BTU and higher octane E4™ ENVIROLENE® mixed alcohols presently isn’t germane to new FFV chips on all new cars being called for in the Open Fuel Standards Act debate. Yet this formula-patented, stronger BTU and higher octane E4™oxygenate WILL become calibrated as volumes of this stronger and less expensive new fuel alcohol begin working into the marketplace. Yet I’m referencing something here which will take a handful of years to accomplish. As others have learned – you don’t build new stainless steel GTL fuel chemistry sets overnight. Yet in a decade, such new GTL fuel synthesis facilities could begin circling the globe and owned by multiple nations and financiers – some municipal based. E4™ GTL catalytic synthesis is accomplished using basically a 90-yr. old design of MeOH GTL thermal chemistry set. A complete change-out of active catalyst is made then stronger BTU, biodegradable Higher Mixed Alcohols are synthesized via GTL methods at nearly 2x the efficiency which MeOH is itself produced.
Walt: I read you loud and clear that the Open Fuel Standards Act going beyond ethanol blends would be something which politically originates within the methanol industry. Let’s just all become more aware here / and consider adding even higher and more effective calibration to such a new FFV chip being called for.
In conclusion: I agree with others that ‘fuel price’ at the pump will become the prime motivator for consumers even more so than ultimate engine performance and resultant emissions profiles. I personally believe it is true that Americans and other global citizens CAN have their cake and EAT it too amid Peak Oil declines. Yet the motoring public as well as 99% of our elected politicians – are not yet aware of the mechanisms to produce decentralized and appetizing new cake. Again, this isn’t rocket science here. Joe & Jane Public need to be honestly educated and this is where news stories and documentary films can fill the gap. I’ve had grade school children understand what I’ve just described after a simple dog & pony demo.
Thus on to the next day… Best of luck to each and every concerned citizen who breathes air, purchases liquid fuel and commutes from place to place, be it via ground or air.
It seems oil is the weapon of choice…but I guess my question is two fold. The Open Fuel Standards sent out an email last night to frame the discussion, with a link to of the key people involved with the OFSA legislation.
Center for Security Policy, and the author of Energy Victory, he compares the Open Fuel Standard with another bill that focuses on natural gas cars.
If we promote methanol imports from China and Methanex what value will America receive beyond tax savings over that burden imposed by OPEC according to Robert Zubrin?
I’m all for any tax reduction on the American people and giving the politicians in Washington limited power to tax and spend. It sounds like importing more methanol from overseas is just the ticket according to the legislation of OFSA!
If the anti-bribery legislation FINALLY being passed in the UK is going to effect the oil and gas industry the hardest, does this mean that all of this bribery business should be directed at OPEC ministers?
I could think of a few countries (American executives not excluded) that refuse to do business unless a whole latter of people are bribed to get into the transaction. Unfortunately, those countries are not members of OPEC and their executives are in suits and ties. It is good that UK has finally (after all these generations) agreed to stop bribing politicians and government leaders legally to win contracts and influence people.
Does this mean that it will stop? Absolutely not. Now, everyone will legally lobby the governments, and the campaign money will flow!
On this issue of toxity to auto and small engines, I have heard that a UK company signed an agreement with one of the major methanol/gasoline distributors in China to add a chemical to the methanol which eliminates or reduces (I don’t know what is true) the problems. Of course, you cannot drink methanol and so it will still be toxic to mankind, but we need to approach any chemical or fuel with caution about drinking it.
My hope is that we will be able to pass good legislation and support more methanol usage…just for the right reasons that give Americans a choice at the pump, and allow domestic producers to compete without having to build multi-billion dollar plants which will never be approved in America. I don’t think it is unreasonable…but it might be unrealistic.
In conclusion: I agree with others that ‘fuel price’ at the pump will become the prime motivator for consumers even more so than ultimate engine performance and resultant emissions profiles. I personally believe it is true that Americans and other global citizens CAN have their cake and EAT it too amid Peak Oil declines.
I’m leaving for a couple days to discuss exactly these points on methanol at the pumps. There is one or two ways this is going to happen, and I suspect the Methanol Lobby (and those behind this legislation) knows how this will happen rapidly. Although I do not want to say anything further on this subject, I would encourage anyone who wants to study the history of the debate between MTBE and Ethanol to search here:
Most of this controversy article after article deals with the debate between MTBE and Ethanol, and you can read how state by state it worked. With MTBE prices rising worldwide…think about Methanol prices at $450/tonne right now, and why. Should we become dependant on imports from China and Methanex?
That 1 billion gallons a year useage quoted in China is the energy equivilant to about 32,600 barrels a day of gasoline.
The US alone consumes about 25 million barrels a day of oil, so this is literally a drop in the ocean.
For this reason alone, any volume of methanol sold would instantly track the energy price of gasoline less any “inconvenience” discount simply due to the fact that it is a tiny sector of a much larger market with more than adequate demand.
Considering we have plenty of uses for both the main methanol feedstocks (coal & nat gas) why bother?
Even processed flare gas methanol would be fairly useless as a fuel as there is a large enough higher margin demand for it as a feedstock. I fail to see why you would want to use it as a fuel.
I would be more than happy to supply the 1 billion gallons a year of methanol in the American market, and let the rest argue it is worthless to the gasoline sector! Rome was not built in a day, and did practically collapse in a day.
Yes, the Chinese fuel methanol usage is only about 30,000bpd equivalent, because they are just finishing a ten year development project on coal to methanol as fuel. The concentrated all their efforts in Shanxi province – the centre of their coal industry, and were determined to get it right, before they scale it up – a commendable apparoach.
As for methanol production, they went from 3m tons in 2003 to producing 17m tons in 2010 [source] – that is quite a ramping up of capacity.
88% of it is still used for non fuel chemical purposes, but they are now working on purpose built plants to produce methanol fuel.
An interesting read on the 10yr development of their methanol fuel program, is here [Mark, Walt, highly recommend if you haven;t seen this already].
The program was kick started with American co-operation and by Ford donating a methanol FFV for them to play with!
- the investment to build a brand new methanol filling station is 1/20th of that for a compressed natural gas one
Why, you would use it because it will likely be cheaper than gasoline, and because it is better! Alcohol fuels, in an engine tuned for them, are more energy efficient, and cleaner burning, than gasoline.
And , if you are building or modifying engines specifically for alcohol, you can use much higher compression ratios getting more power ad better fuel efficiency.
This graph is of engine testing with different mixtures of methanol and gasoline - see if you can spot the trend and guess where pure gasoline would rate on the efficiency scale, compared to pure methanol;
Paul, your whole quote was really excellent. I pasted it and sent it to colleagues at some of the super majors, some bankers and my entire private email list. The past two days I was visiting a biodiesel facility and also looking at the numbers for blenders of gasoline and diesel. The impact some old Bush legislation is now having on the industry, and found everything to be very very interesting. I must admit that biodiesel and methanol could make a breakthrough much sooner than other advanced biofuels, but in light of where all the money is being invested I suspect everyone is focused on using mandates to sell fuel at any market price due to lack of mandated supply, and required demand. A traders dream from what I saw on the trading floor two days ago. The good news is that the VC’s are likely going to pull out of this looking like some really smart money!
The no so good news for me is I think I’m going to bow out of posting further on the blog. I think that I have given methanol a positive push along with others, but I am convinced the technology sector is being driven by a lot more politics than practical solutions, and this last trip gave me the hard numbers I needed that justified why technology is not a factor in the hundreds of millions going into these processes. I noticed this press release recently and using that background with what I learned about the ethanol mandates it made sense how they can take trash, convert it to methanol and then convert it to ethanol as a business model.
I understand the ethanol mandates do not allow corn based ethanol to be included, except for corn oil can be used for biodiesel and qualify, and so these models above make sense. You don’t raise $130 million if you cannot make money somehow.
It dawned on me that the $1.56/gal. gasoline that we estimate we can make from flared gas or natural gas at min. 10 mmscfd feed rates is going to be not only not taken seriously, but never make an analyst headline. Some on our team recognize that our posting is only hurting our reputation and after Robert took down our video because I made him upset we need to focus on the technology not the policy at our early stage. I like the idea of being a bit of an underdog but there is a time when you have to take the beating and go back to work in light of the policies. Mandates may not drive all this investment forever, and until that changes we need to look at what fuel choice at the pumps could mean for those with alcohol based fuels. I see potential, and your paper today has tipped us over the edge that if China/Methanex is doing it, we can too.
A woman of her age and education once thought that oil was a four letter word? Sounds somewhat naive. Oil replaced slavery. It quite literally sustains the lives of almost seven billion people. There would be no modern world without that compact source of liquid energy. It’s time to move away from it as there was a time to move away from buring our forests for energy.

Compare. The levels of threat and reward range a little bit not only from procedure to process, but from unit to unit with regards to the maker, and from surgeon to surgeon dependant upon their degree of experience with a specific method.
The classes in this package are used to represent screen content and changes to it as well as APIs for querying the global accessibility state of the system.
AccessibilityEvents are sent by the system when something notable happens in the user interface. For example, when a Button is clicked, a View is focused, etc.
AccessibilityRecord contains information about state change of its source View. When a view fires an accessibility event it requests from its parent to dispatch the constructed event. The parent may optionally append a record for itself for providing more context to AccessibilityServices. Hence, accessibility services can facilitate additional accessibility records to enhance feedback.
AccessibilityNodeInfo represents a node of the window content as well as actions that can be requested from its source. From the point of view of an AccessibilityService a window content is presented as tree of accessibility node info which may or may not map one-to-one to the view hierarchy. In other words, a custom view is free to report itself as a tree of accessibility node info.
AccessibilityManager is a system level service that serves as an event dispatch for AccessibilityEvents, and provides facilities for querying the accessibility state of the system. Accessibility events are generated when something notable happens in the user interface, for example an Activity starts, the focus or selection of a View changes etc. Parties interested in handling accessibility events implement and register an accessibility service which extends AccessibilityService.

AccessibilityNodeInfo This class represents a node of the window content as well as actions that can be requested from its source.
AccessibilityNodeProvider This class is the contract a client should implement to enable support of a virtual view hierarchy rooted at a given view for accessibility purposes.
AccessibilityRecord Represents a record in an AccessibilityEvent and contains information about state change of its source View.

[Discussion] When you see a game on sale in Play Store, do you get the urge to buy it even if you've already played / purchased it on another platform?
I have paired my DS4 with my Galaxy Tab A... How do I go about actually getting it to work with emulators like MyBoy and PPSSPP?
Off Target Studios first teaser trailer for Backstock Hustle. It will be Available on andriod on January 20th, 2016 Thank you
[Tip] For anyone playing Adventure Time: Champions game, Bittercap now features a few data mined stats and charts!
Of course I would laugh at you. Now here I am, buying Saramost 3, Legend of the skyfish, baldur gate ports, square enix ports, All the Sorcery! games, Tales from the borderlands ,Don't Starve etc.
Jesus times have changed, maybe it's time I bought a MIFI controller for the less ideal games for touchscreen
I suffer from this urge. Machinarium is going for $0.99 right now. I have already played and completed that on iPad. And yet, my fingers are itching to buy it on play store. Table Tennis Touch is going for $0.10. I already have that for free from Amazon Underground, and I have never played that. And yet again, itchy fingers.
Is coop storyline progressing with friends even possible? Me and friends tried but we still had to replay the stage on solo to go further,or did we miss something?
Title basically says it all. I have connected the controller via bluetooth but when I load a game it doesn't work. When I try to change the inputs, when I push a button on my ds4 to assign a control nothing happens. Any ideas?
I want to buy a new controller mainly for PC, but it would be nice to be able to use it too on Android. I'm mainly worried about compatibility or mapping issues. And then maybe about input lag issues since Id like to be able to play action games, and maybe cast them to a TV or something.
I was thinking about getting the new Xbox one S controller which has bluetooth but I don't know how well it'll work on Android games. Also have been thinking of getting a MOGA.
A while ago I got Half-Life 2 and Portal working on my rooted S5. Has anyone managed this with a rooted S7? Mine crashes after the Source Logo.

Start your custom “Physical Strength” project by clicking the button next to your favorite “Physical Strength” title below...
體力 means "physical strength," "physical power," or "physical stamina" in Chinese, ancient Japanese, and old Korean Hanja.
The first character was first simplified in Japan. Later, that simplified version became the standard in mainland China. Just in case you want this version, it is offered here. I suggest it if you audience is Japanese. Most Chinese know the older traditional version which looks like 體力.
体力 can also be defined: stamina; endurance; physical strength; resilience; resistance to disease; clout; stability.
氣力 can mean any of the words in the title above, and in some context, can also mean, effort, will-power, or talent.
In modern Japan, they use a simplified first character for this word. If you want to order this title with that special Japanese version, click on the character to the right instead of the button above.

skandha, v. 塞; older tr. 陰, intp. as that which covers or conceals, implying that physical and mental forms obstruct realization of the truth; while the tr. 蘊, implying an accumulation or heap, is a nearer connotation to skandha, which, originally meaning the shoulder, becomes stem, branch, combination, the objects of sense, the elements of being or mundane consciousness. The term is intp. as the five physical and mental constituents, which combine to form the intelligent 性 or nature; rūpa, the first of the five, is considered as physical, the remaining four as mental; v. 五蘊. The skandhas refer only to the phenomenal, not to the 無爲 non-phenomenal.

When the calligrapher finishes creating your artwork, it is taken to my art mounting workshop in Beijing where a wall scroll is made by hand from a combination of silk, rice paper, and wood.
After we create your wall scroll, it takes at least two weeks for air mail delivery from Beijing to you.
When you select your calligraphy, you'll be taken to another page where you can choose various custom options.
Instead of drawing characters by hand, the new generation in China merely type roman letters into their computer keyboards and pick the character that they want from a list that pops up.
There is some fear that true Chinese calligraphy may become a lost art in the coming years. Many art institutes in China are now promoting calligraphy programs in hopes of keeping this unique form of art alive.
Even with the teachings of a top-ranked calligrapher in China, my calligraphy will never be good enough to sell. I will leave that to the experts.
The same calligrapher who gave me those lessons also attracted a crowd of thousands and a TV crew as he created characters over 6-feet high. He happens to be ranked as one of the top 100 calligraphers in all of China. He is also one of very few that would actually attempt such a feat.

Start your custom “Remember” project by clicking the button next to your favorite “Remember” title below...
銘記 means to keep in mind, to take note of, or simply to remember, in Chinese characters and Japanese Kanji.
The second character means to remember, to note, mark, sign, to record, history, chronicle, or annals.
When used in the context of a person, this means to engrave on the heart, or to inscribe a memory in one's mind. In short, it's the idea of deeply remembering something, some event, or someone forever.
Note: Because this selection contains some special Japanese Hiragana characters, it should be written by a Japanese calligrapher.
念 can be defined these ways: To read; to study (a degree course); to read aloud; to miss somebody (keeping them in your mind); idea; remembrance; sense; thought; feeling; desire; concern; attention; recollection; memory; to think on/about; reflect; repeat, intone; a moment.
Obviously, the context in which the character is used determines which definition or meaning is perceived. As a single character, it's open and perhaps ambiguous. Thus, it can be read with any or all of these meanings.
念 is used in a Buddhist context (often written as 正念 or "right mindfulness") with similar meanings of thought and contemplation.
And remember your ancestors and those that came before you whose sacrifices made your present life better.
Some Chinese will separate the intended meaning from this proverb and translate this as "Don't forget the people who once helped you." In Modern China, this idiom is virtually never used to refer to an actual well.
This title is used almost exclusively in a Buddhist context (not all Chinese or Japanese people will recognize it).
If one remembers the lessons of the past; They will serve as a guide to avoid mistakes in the future.
This proverb comes from the 5th century B.C. just before the Warring States Period in the territory now known as China.
The head of the State of Jin, Zhi Bo, seized power in a coup. He did this with help from the armies of the State of Han and Wei. Instead of being grateful for the help from Han and Wei, he treacherously took the land of Han and Wei. Never satisfied, Zhi Bo employed the armies of Han and Wei to attack and seize the State of Zhao.
The king of Zhao took advice from his minister Zhang Mengtan and secretly contacted the Han and Wei armies to reverse their plans and attack the army of Zhi Bo instead. The plan was successful, and the State of Zhao was not only saved but was set to become a powerful kingdom in the region.
Zhang Mengtan immediately submitted his resignation to a confused king of Zhao. When asked why, Zhang Mengtan said, "I've done my duty to save my kingdom but looking back at past experience, I know sovereign kings are never satisfied with the power or land at hand. They will join others and fight for more power and more land. I must learn from past experiences, as those experiences are the teachers of future events."
For generations, the State of Zhao continued to fight for power and land until finally being defeated and decimated by the State of Qin (which lead to the birth of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C.).
This is an old Japanese proverb that suggests you try to never forget the enthusiasm you had as a child when you try new things (or even face the day-to-day). Basically avoid having a mundane attitude that many people get with age.
Note: This is sometimes written as 初心忘る可からず. The one shown above is used about 10x more often. There's only one character difference between the two versions.
Some people may refer to this entry as Remember Kanji, Remember Characters, Remember in Mandarin Chinese, Remember Characters, Remember in Chinese Writing, Remember in Japanese Writing, Remember in Asian Writing, Remember Ideograms, Chinese Remember symbols, Remember Hieroglyphics, Remember Glyphs, Remember in Chinese Letters, Remember Hanzi, Remember in Japanese Kanji, Remember Pictograms, Remember in the Chinese Written-Language, or Remember in the Japanese Written-Language.

This movie never promised to be the ultimate and definite historical movie about the Battle of Thermopylae. the movie instead promised to be a visual spectacle with big effects and spectacular action sequences. The movie promised to be simple entertainment and entertaining it was.
It's like how entertainment should be; simple and deliciously over-the-top. "300" is of course a movie that deliciously goes over-the-top with its images and overall style. The Frank Miller graphic novel gets translated very well to the big screen in terms of its style and atmosphere. The entire movie is greatly comic book looking, with its backgrounds, characters and action. Just like the other Frank Miller graphic novel turned movie "Sin City", the entire movie was shot in a studio, with the use of blue- and green-screen, to give the movie an authentic, unusual but beautiful and spectacular looking visual style.
Its style and characters make sure that you won't ever take this movie serious, unless you of course really believe that the Persian army used big over-sized misshapen, mutant looking creatures, Xerses really had such a deep voice and all of the battles happened in slow-motion. If you have a hard time coping with this comic book style and way of storytelling and interpretation of history, don't watch this movie and stick to historical books instead. But if you're simply interested in good quality action and entertainment, this is the perfect overblown blockbuster movie for you.
The story is simple and its basically about the Spartans standing their ground, attack-wave after attack-wave. The story trows in some more plot lines, involving King Leonidas' wife Queen Gorgo, who tries to convince the council to send more military support to save her husband, who knows he's going to meet a certain death. The diversity between those two main plot lines of attack and mostly talking and corruption work out well. Had the movie only been purely action it would had become tiresome after a while, I am sure. Also especially since the action is mostly of the same. Every attack-wave they encounter more dangerous, better skilled and often also more ugly looking enemies. Like a computer game, in which you advance one level-up, after you've beaten the enemy.
But yes, it's also a missed opportunity that they didn't stick to the true story, since it's far more interesting and in my opinion also more heroic as the story portrayed in this movie. But it's of course also more complex and because of that also possibly less entertaining. I've always been greatly interested and fascinated by the story of the battle of Thermopylae, so I've wouldn't minded some more accuracy but I can understand and appreciate the approach of this movie and its story of the famous battle. Still sort of too bad that they decided to go with a voice over that tells what happens on screen and what the emotions and atmosphere was. The images themselves should be powerful and perfect enough to tell all of this.
Everything in the movie is just basically very black & white and doesn't get complicated. Meaning that the good guys are all extremely good and they look like perfect creatures, with perfect biceps and white teeth and the villains are extremely evil and look like monsters, also complete with bad teeth.
Definitely true that the best parts were already in the trailer but the movie still has plenty of visual surprises and spectacular action in it. The idea and sight of 300 Spartans facing an over a million man large Persian army is both impressive as spectacular. The best parts are definitely the action sequences, that show the bravery of the Spartans and their fighting skills and tactics, against the poorly organized and trained Persian army.
The acting by the way was definitely better than expected. From a movie like this you just don't expect grand performances. Gerard Butler was great as the roaring and heroic King Leonidas and David Wenham and Vincent Regan play some good supporting roles. Of course the dialog isn't much special but this again perfectly suits the comic book style of film-making.
I don't think that is a movie that will ever grow into becoming a classic and therefor I feel that it's also slightly exaggerated that the movie is actually in the IMDb top250. Nevertheless it's a movie that shall always remain perfectly entertaining to watch.

“My father was not a fighter. He was not armed. The [Israeli] soldiers took him from our house and tortured him without any mercy, they killed him and gave us his body, my brothers and I are orphans now. Where is the international conscience, where is the United Nations that puts the victim and the attacker on the same scale? My father was a peaceful man supporting his six children.”
With these words, Mustafa Husny Fayid, 13, started talking about the tragedy that beset his family when the Israeli army carried out the Jenin refugee camp massacre in 2002, during an invasion that Israel calls “Operation Defensive Shield”.
Five years after the massacre, the child was finally able to talk about what happened when he was seven. He expressed his anger that “the world is still unable to stop the Israeli atrocities”.
“The world is talking about justice, peace and human rights but when it comes to us, and to what Israel is doing to us, they change their concepts and principles. We are refugees dreaming of a stable life, a country and a humble home”, Mustafa stated, “Where is the world justice, were is the international law, how come the committee set up to investigate the massacre in our camp was never allowed to be formed? They should come here and see how we are living, and the destruction inflicted on us and on our future. The occupation is the cause of all our problems, but nobody wants to see the truth, they want us to be silent”.
The misery of the child and his family started when the Israeli army invaded the camp in April 2002. “When the army invaded the camp, soldiers started occupying homes and started ambushing the fighters, then they started shelling all the houses after totally surrounding the camp”, Mustafa said, “Everything became dangerous, danger was all around us. We were hiding in one room for a whole week, while planes and tanks were firing shells and missiles at the whole camp. We lived in fear and my younger brothers never stopped crying the whole time. My father asked us not to be afraid, and he read us verses of the holy Quran”.
At that, Mustafa stopped talking for a while. His eyes were filled with tears as he looked at his fathers’ picture hanging on the wall. Finally he continued, “Several days after the invasion began, we knew that the soldiers had the whole camp surrounded, and that the invasion was getting more violent and fierce. Then the shelling intensified and the soldiers shelled the mosque near our house”.
The next morning, the army started advancing into the camp, and the soldiers started knocking on the doors ordering all men to leave the houses and surrender themselves to them.
“We heard violent knocking on our door, and we became so scared. My father opened the door and saw more than 30 military jeeps outside on the street. The soldiers then broke into our house and started searching it, they stepped with their dirty feet on the bread, and started breaking the dishes, smashing the windows and then they started hitting my father violently before taking him to the yard, we heard him screaming from the pain, before they took him away”.
According to other eyewitness accounts, Mustafa’s father was used as a human shield by the soldiers, who forced him to knock on the doors of neighboring houses before they broke into them and abducted the inhabitants.
“Later on, the soldiers returned. They had my father and my uncle, and locked them in a small room in our house. The soldiers saw drawings that my kid brothers had painted on the wall in our house, maps of Palestine and other drawings, and the soldiers were angry and said that those drawings are maps for the fighters to escape and started hitting my father on his head”, Mustafa added.
“They were violently hitting my father on his head, and were screaming and shouting at him, he started bleeding and they took him out in spite of his injuries and pain”.
Eyewitnesses told Mustafa that they saw the soldiers torturing his father as they were taking him to an armored vehicle, then they transferred him to a location where the soldiers gathered with their vehicles. According to local accounts, Israeli troops took dozens of residents to the temporary camp where Mustafa saw them taking his father.
There, the soldiers tortured and interrogated the men. At one point, according to eyewitnesses, Mustafa’s father pleaded to be taken to a hospital, but the soldiers refused to provide him with any medical treatment.
Later on, soldiers took the man to an unknown destination; some residents said that they saw him at a Civil Administration Office which belongs to the Israeli army. The residents said that they heard him screaming, and then he stopped.
“He wasn’t breathing, and the people told me when that happened they started shouting at the soldiers, he is dead, the man is dead”, Mustafa said, “Then the soldiers gave him first aid and took him to a hospital, after that we never knew where he was”.
“We were told by the army that my father was at Al Foula Israeli hospital, but when we phoned the hospital, they told us that he was not there, we contacted the Red Crescent and the Red Cross and they told us that the soldiers took my father to Ofer prison. We searched for him for three months”.
“The Prisoners Society, the Red Crescent and several organizations helped in the effort to locate my father. They were informed by the army that my father was taken prisoner, but when medical institutions and the lawyer of the prisoners’ society contacted the army officers, they said that his name was not among the list of detainees”.
Different stories regarding the destiny of Mustafa’s dad increased the worries of his family, and three months later, after extensive efforts by the family and several institutions, the army admitted that the father was dead.
“We lived through tough times, as the army was waging its cruel war against the camp, against us, we were unable to hide our fears, our tears, my little brothers and I were crying day and night”. Mustafa stated.
But when the news finally arrived about the whereabouts of the father, it was shocking to know the truth, that he was a dead body at Abu Kbeer Israeli morgue. When the army handed the body of the father to his family, their grief was even greater, it was in a closed coffin.
Nobody was allowed to see him because his body was severely mutilated and deformed. And now, five years after his father was killed, Mustafa is speaking.
“I insist that those responsible for his death should be prosecuted, I appeal to the international organizations to adopt the case of my father and file charges against the Israeli army, I want to know how did he die in their prisons, he left the house on his feat, and return to us a dead body, they took him away from us, forever”.

Can I just get Discs, hubs and calipers, make brackets and slap them on the stock spindle? (Obviously not that simple but you get my point)
Making the bracket is not the problem. It's finding a disc and caliper set that would fit the 105E spindle. ( Cortina discs / calipers won't work ). Milton is your best bet. The kit is 188 pds without the calipers. You would need to find Escort MK3/4 or Nissan Micra calipers. Nissan Sentra cailpers maybe the same but not sure. You can goggle and find out what's interchangeable.
Why didn't I think of this sooner? With 90+ years of history under their belt, there is a lot more to Ford of Europe than the smattering of cars (and trucks) that they has offered in North America.

In Poland it is possible to pay by credit card (VISA, American Express, Euro Card etc.). Credit cards are accepted in hotels, restaurants and in bigger shops, however they are not as popular as in Western Europe.

After another couple weeks of speculation, hype and quotage, it’s time for BallinEurope to revisit the odds: specifically speaking, the odds on NBA players coming to play ball on The Continent in 2011-12.

I am pleased to present a guest post from my good friend, RoseAnne Mussar. She hails from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and trains in Modern Arnis at the 6Tigers Academy in Barrhaven under Renshi Janet Heffernan. She also trains in the American Cane System, often traveling to New York for training.
“Aren’t you a little old for that?” was my sister’s reaction when I mentioned that I was starting karate lessons. And she had a good point. At 47, it was a little late for a Pudgy Middle-Aged Matron© to be starting in….well, let’s back it up a bit, shall we?
I may be middle-aged now, but I’ve always been pudgy (OK, fat). I was never athletic. Ever. When I was a kid, martial arts was that kung-fu stuff at the Saturday matinee, and gym class was an endlessly humiliating series of being picked last for the team. Oh, the memories.
But life goes on and you meet a great guy and fall in love and get married and have two amazingly awesome kids who decide to try karate. So I watched my children do karate for five or six years, thinking “gee that looks like fun.”
Around my 47th birthday, I signed up for a Women’s Self Defense course. As nervous as all get-out, I stepped onto the mats. I had the time of my life kicking pads, punching dummies, and applying devastating techniques to some poor guy in a red man suit. I had a blast, but more importantly, I realized that I could do this. Where do I sign up?
Karate was the obvious choice, but to be truthful, it was a bit of a rough start. A lot of the karate stuff was hard on my knees (I got my official osteoarthritis diagnosis a couple of years ago). I also tried Defendo for a while. I managed to get my Level 2 certification but seriously, what was I thinking?
However, the kids had started doing this funny little thing with sticks which kinda looked interesting.
So I picked up some sticks. Clouds parted. Scintillating beams of sunlight shone down. A heavenly choir of golden voices sang “this is what you want to do!” Where do I sign up?
Six years later, I’m still swinging the sticks and loving every minute of it. I love the physical and mental challenge of martial arts, especially with weapons. I love being stronger, healthier, and more confident. I love that I love being physically active- something I used to hate. I love that my husband Gary signed up too! Plus, I’ve picked up a couple of other arts: American Cane System, and sport whip cracking (yes it’s a thing). I may still be a Pudgy Middle-Aged Matron©, but I’m a PMAM who kicks ass!
It’s trite but true: the first step is often the hardest. And occasionally not in quite the right direction. But that’s perfectly OK. It’s never too late to take that step. So pick up those sticks and start swinging – see how amazing you can be!
Martial Arts topics are preferred. Please contact me at MasterBrian@bamboospiritmartialarts.com to express your interest and for further details. I’d like to hear from you!
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaay! So glad Ms. Mussar found her niche! I myself began Karate at age 44. So I totally understand. It’s an awesome time of life to begin ’cause the kiddos are getting independent 🙂
Hey Joelle, thanks for commenting. Yes, she’s doing quite well and I’m looking forward to seeing her at her dojo in the near future!
Hi Joelle – sorry for not replying sooner. Thank you for your kind words. I always enjoy reading your comments on Jackie’s blog!
Dear RoseAnne, if you are reading this, I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed your article! Sounds like you are having the time of your life. I really hope that others will read your post, and realise that as you say, it really is Never Too Late!
Congratulations, As my current Arnis Kali partner is a 61 years old lady, I totally agree with you. You all are inspiring.
Just when you think you've bought all that you can imagine from Amazon, they up the ante with Christmas trees.
A Shiawasseee County Sheriff's Deputy went above and beyond his daily duties by giving some Christmas joy to residents in need.
If you are having trouble getting into the holiday spirit, this might help you out. This family decided to break out the AC/DC to amp up their Christmas light display.
Christmas is right around the corner and tonight Flint will get lit up. The official lighting of the 35-foot Christmas tree in downtown is tonight at 6 pm.
Each year around the holidays, we make it a point to stop all of the mocking and joking around for at least one day and use the reach that this radio show has to do some good. For the 15th consecutive year, we'll be conducting the Free Beer and Hot Wings Holiday Break-in.
Are you feeling lonely today? Are you wishing you were alone instead of with your dysfunctional family? Do you like girls in Santa suits? I am out of questions - but I do have a video compilation for you of celebrities in Santa Claus suits. Maybe not the HOTTEST of hot - but porn actresses were not …
I am certainly geeky, but I am no gamer. If you have a gamer on your Christmas list - this guide may help you find the perfect present. If I am on your list, I would like tequila. Yeah, I'll have that!
This guy is most definitely not in the holiday spirit. While a group of carolers were singing in front of a big Christmas tree in a town, this guy decided he had had enough. He starts yelling at the singers and then snaps. He smashes their guitar and begins stomping on all of their presents!
The kids are growing up so fast nowadays. This is the normal response this day in age when you don't know an answer. Instead of saying I don't know or picking a side, this girl goes straight to the "F You!"
The Satanic Temple plans to erect a hellish Christmas display this year near the steps of the Michigan Capitol. The state has granted the group permission to spread holiday cheer in the form of serpents and a baphomet from December 21 through the 23rd.

Housing today continues its trend toward expensive, large buildings that are energy inefficient, give off gas toxic materials, do not capture and recycle water, or use green principles and design, in general. There is a need to demonstrate sustainable housing models . . . especially for single adults, and adults with one child, senior citizens, or couples.
The Project Leader has visited prototypical cottage home clusters but do not maximize green components and strategies, nor are affordable for the target population mentioned above.
To start with, we will seek to demonstrate clustered cottage homes with common space for gardens, out buildings, parking, and community use. State-of-the-art features that are energy efficient, use renewable energy, energy-efficient appliances, water recycling, green materials, recycled materials and techniques, and alternative community transportation will be demonstrated. Eight to twelve units built on a collectively small footprint will be the goal, with approximately 800 square feet per unit.
Create with prototypical models. Federal, state and local grant funds, foundation resources, private sector partnerships, and networking to further the goals of the project. By starting under a non-profit charter provides opportunity for funds not available directly to a private sector initiative alone, especially on the R&D needs.
Mission Statement: Anansi Education is a non-profit organization that funds the high school education of academically qualified students in Ghana who are otherwise unable to continue their education due to financial need.
We hold an annual auction in the United States, with African artifacts, artwork and crafts that have been selected and shipped from Africa, by our director.
We provide guide services to tourists traveling in Ghana with 40% of the associated revenue going to Anansi and 60% going to the guide.
Anansi operates a Bed and Breakfast for tourists in Ghana with a percentage of the proceeds going directly to the program.
Using our selection criteria, as defined by our mission statement, Anansi funds as many applicants as possible.
Student School assignment is made by the government, and we currently have 38 students placed in nine different schools. We provide eac h student with the required school uniforms, bedding and supplies. We make every attempt to provide each student with an individual to whom they can write and from whom they can receive letters and emotional support.
Ghana is a developing country, not an undeveloped country, where a helping hand for the under privileged youth can make a big difference. Motivation of the students is high as they are acutely aware of what their lives would be without a high school education.
Each spring, since 2004, Anansi has held an African Art benefit auction in Washington State. This auction is Anansi's only fundraising event and the primary source of sponsorships and donations. Please contact us to be placed on the invitation list.

If you have been involved in a motor vehicle accident, a whiplash injury can occur and should be not taken lightly. In a lot of cases, there are no symptoms, such as pain or stiff, right after the car accident. Sometimes, it can take weeks to months for the symptoms to manifest.
Whiplash is, by far, the most common injury to the neck and back during an auto accident. This is caused by a sudden movement of the neck, either forward, backwards or sideways.
Without neck pain, back pain, or stiffness, it is easy to think that one has walked away from an accident unscathed. However, research has shown that an impact as little as 5 mph can cause damage from whiplash to the joints, ligaments, muscles, and other tissues. This damage can further predispose that area to debilitating and permanent disc and joint issues.
Don't just sit back and not seek treatment, even if someone has told you the pain will go away on its own. You would be doing a disservice to yourself and your health.
You owe it to yourself to have a spinal and/or extremity checkup in order to avoid future issues. Contact the office today for your Chiropractic checkup!

Millions of Americans suffer from chronic facial and neck pain as well as recurrent headaches. In some cases this pain is due to Temporomandibular Disorder, or TMD. In today's modern lifestyle, stress often presents itself as chronic myofacial fatigue and jaw pain. The Temporomandibular joint and supporting ligaments often are placed under great stress and fatigue in our modern and very demanding lifestyle. The fact is TMD has become quite common.
Your temporomandibular joints, or jaw joints, connect your lower jawbone to your skull. As you may imagine, these joints get quite a lot of use throughout the day as you speak, chew, swallow, and yawn. Pain in and around these joints can be unpleasant and may even restrict movement.
Should you notice any of these symptoms, let us know! We can help advise you as to whether they indicate the presence of TMD, and what sort of treatment is appropriate for you.
Our approach to TMD is primarily non-pharmacological. We start with a thorough screening process. Identify the severity of the symptoms, and begin treatment with the least invasive techniques.
Physical exam of the jaw joint, supporting ligaments and surrounding muscles. This is performed by manual palpation.
Pan radiograph to exam the condition of the chondyle, disc and eminence. This depicts the current condition of the bone and cartilage structures of the TMJ.
We treat TMD if diagnosed with the least invasive technique possible. Each patient is unique and requires a tailored treatment. Examples of our more common treatment options follow:
Mandibular Repositioning Devices. This can help release pressure on the TMJ disc and associated ligaments.
Manual muscle stretching and relaxation. This can sometimes require physical therapy and chiropractic services.
In some rare cases, the jaw pain is multifactorial and will require specialized treatment outside the scope of Doctor Whitfield's practice. Dr. Whitfield uses several practitioners in Seattle that utilize additional modalities such as medications to modify the pain response. Additionally, sometimes TMD is part of a larger health issue that requires a multidisciplinary approach that must include your medical doctor.
There are some simple things you can do at home or work to prevent TMD from occurring in your jaw joints:
Don't cradle the phone receiver between your head and shoulder — either use a headset or hold the receiver to your ear

Systematically and mercilessly disassembling, flushing, greasing, and re-packing the cycling culture.
Firstly, I'd like to take this opportunity to announce that today marks the official start of my "Summer Recess." This is the period during which I sew the pant legs back onto all my cutoff shorts, take my fall chicken suit out of cold storage (if I don't store it properly it will molt), and change the grips and tape on the "touch points" of my various bicycles to "colourways" that are more seasonally appropriate. As you can imagine, this process is quite labor intensive, so that means I will be taking a break from this blog, but rest assured that I will return on Tuesday, September 8th with regular updates. You can also rest assured that my helper monkey Vito and I will take the opporunity to catch up on other matters as well, such as the dissemination of the various "prizeways" for the Fat Cyclist Knuckle Tattoo Tribute Competition, the perusal of emails, and of course the much-needed shampooing and deodorizing of my 70s-themed bicycle work area. (Suede bean bags and shag carpet may look great, but they also tend to retain both grease and odors--especially when you employ a helper monkey.)
Secondly, I'm pleased to present you with a quiz. As always, study the item, think, and click on your answer. If you're right you'll see confirmation, and if you're wrong you'll be seduced by Murray.
Thanks very much for reading, emailing, commenting and making the "process" of writing this blog so enjoyable, be sure to wring the last few drops of sweaty enjoyment from the remainder of the summer, enjoy the Labor Day weekend (assuming your countryway observes it), and ride safely, smartly, and flambulliently.
1) Gary Klein, once synonymous with fat aluminum tubing and dessert-like "colourways," is now synonymous with:
5) Who makes this steel "club racer," complete with gently sloping top tube and bars slightly lower than the saddle?
7) According to Zipp's lead engineer Josh Poertner, why did both of Magnus Backstedt's wheels fail in the 2008 Paris-Roubaix?
9) Tough times for the men's magazines? The above image, complete with crappy old department store mountain bike, is this month's "Playboy" centerfold.
2 years ago I was walking my dog on Beach Street near Hudson, wearing a flowered dress and listening to ____________________________ on my discman! You biked by, black jeans, gangly, no helmet, turned around to look at me. Smiled cheekily. It may have been directed at the person behind me but I never forgot. I had just cut my hair. I love you?
Sir Snob, I am hearing rumors that you may travel to our fair state to take part in Ye Olde Single-Speede World Championships 2009, in Durango, Colorado. I am also hearing rumors that your identity will remain secret. That's well and good and all - I don't need to know your name. But if the first rumor is true, welcome, Wordsmith, to our beautiful land of mountains and rednecks with trucks and guns. Oh yeah, and prepare to get your ass kicked! (I am. Preparing, that is.)
The Magnus wheel cracker questions and linked Zipp article was particulary funny. I remember reading a Paris Roubaix Zipp carbon wheel/team test a few years ago. After a whole lot of technical blah-blah-blah Cancellara turned to the Zipp engineers and told them: "If you ride anything but a an 32 spoke low profile alloy wheel on this shit you're a complete idiot." And this was before they managed to crack two or three sets of carbon hoops on just a few hundred yards of cobbles.
Hm...not much of a score. Let me be the first to say I wasn't holding out much hope for the Creedence.
I locked (with a U-Lock and cable) my Red and White Schwinn Frontier bike on a fence in front of 226 East 32nd Street on Tuesday night at approximately 9:30 pm. On Wednesday at 9:30 pm, I checked on the bike and it was still there. I went to ride the bike a few hours later -- approximately 2:00 am and the bike was gone. If anyone sees it let me know. I recently bought the bike new - less than a month ago - so I have proof of purchase and the serial number. I called the owner of the building but he claims he is wealthy and did not cut it. The super in the building next door claims that he hates bikes on his fence and has cut bikes -- even though there is no sign. The owner claims it could have been construction workers on the block. Thanks for your help.
...so bsnyc/rtms...does "summer recess announcement" imply that yer intending to "school" someone between now n' labor day ???...
let's see.. there was music, and.. It was a bike! No? .. not a real bike. Kind of one of those weird, twisted things that sometimes you see in..
...gee...i guess w/ bsnyc/rtms out a' the picture (literally) for the next week n' a half, this site is gonna become like one a those "end of summer" schmaltzy romance songs...
Holy Glenn-Close-Fatal-Attraction Batman, you ride by some hippie chick who gets her hair cut every two years and smile during the Bush Administration, and she obsesses and declares her undying love for you two years later? Proud Mary, please keep on rollin'.
Anon 2:10..it would be easier to let you know if anyone sees it if you let people know who you are, ...you know?
Modifying lugs to cut grams? Isn't that what crabon is for? What kind of weight weenine rides a Rivendell anyway?
Just got my new issue of Bicycling and the Elite Cyclist, Chris Carmichael is all over it. In his own column, car ad, and other contributors articles. You need to step up your game and get the same amount of elite attention from the mag.
For those missing BSNYC in the next two weeks, I will be reading aloud "Best of BSNYC" on HAM radio frequencies 3.750 - 4.000 Mhz.
Looks like Grant Peterson has decided his frame company should try and actually make money with the general public, as opposed to just the wealthy spinally-challenged.
We should keep this comments thread active whilst snob is away (since the comments threads from BSNYC postings are pretty much my primary source for news & information these days.)
...i was thinking along the lines of "theme from a summer place" by percy faith & his orchestra (please...i don't have the time, ask yer folks or yer grandparents) as a basic background piece...no lyrics...
...then maybe "summer song" by chad & jeremy...(really ???...doesn't anyone know their summer romance musical history ???)...
...schmaltzy as fuck but required listening would then be "sealed w/ a kiss" by brian hyland...dripping, oozing, retched excess...
...i'll grant ya "summer nights" from grease...i mean, travolta & newton-john ???...that's definitely in the "summer schmaltz" ballpark...
...& not beat this dead horse too long, we end it all w/ "see you in september" by the happenings (ain't that an apropo name ???) from 1966, which is undoubtedly the song bsnyc/rtms will be humming to hisself 'til the next post...
I'm kinda partial to Henley's The Boys of Summer, or In The Summertime by Mungo Jerry -try to get THAT outta your head.
But, for actual discman-era correctness, I think Summertime by DJ Jazzy Jeff, Fresh Prince, etc. is the tune to have.
...wow !!!...reed enwright...when it comes to romantic summer schmaltz, you can never have to many "strings" or "strings attached" for that matter...nice...
funny, both the Y Water and Unicycle videos have a similar hit count. Are we the only people paying attention to this shite?
BGW: I don't need to ask my folks, I've been in several elevators and shopped at the local super-stroll consumer retail outlets. So I'm well versed.

Snobbatical theory #2: Brazilian wax job gone horribly wrong, along with some time off for taintal healing.
yellin at a woman driving a dam minivan with a greenpeace sticker "quit wasting gas and stop making so many babies"
I'm trying to think of a way to conduct, a preferably daily, blog-podium race with a random start time. Nothing seems to be clicking though.
I think that the process could use some improvement. After some analysis, it appears to me that there is an actual possibility for an unsavory character to manipulate the process...not that any of the regulars out here would have the moral turpitude to commit such an egregious act, but I'm saying it's a possibility.
I'm back from my surprise trip to the special island where every day is "Wednesday afternoon". Alas, I will have to wait another 10-ish days before the next installment of Snobertainment.
I see your point. Someone with fewer scruples than ourselves could manipulate the comments board for their own gain. Cads.
If only there was a way to get information and facts by searching a huge database. You could just type in a few terms, then tiny elves with IT certificates from deVry would work tirelessly for about 5 seconds and return the answer.
CommieCanuck: I sense a hint of sarcasm in your response. Has Canada become so pedestrian that you have spun into a callous state of ennui? I guess there could be humor to be found in your response if you think about it. Like you were addressing the Anon in an intentionally obtuse manner...you clever dog...is that what you're up to? Anyway, hoist a Molson and enjoy the day...for soon our snob returns...
I think I'd take great hillbilly pride in nailing the Prius driver as the cocksucker that he truly is. Plus it has a nice ring to it.
As far as the Greenpeace-rubbing-progressive-cnut in-the-mini-van: even we dumb-ass yankees know female mini-van drivers are stone deaf and stupid so it doesn't fucking matter what you yell at them.
so, guess who got to pace Zabriskie from the top of paris mountain back down to downtown greenville during the us pro championships yesterday. Oh yeah.
...as regards your quandary, i think "yellin at a woman driving a dam minivan with a greenpeace sticker "quit wasting gas and stop making so many babies" " has a certain expressive panache prob'ly not often found down 'viper' way...
...but when it comes to "self righteous" (self rijus) points, well sir, "yellin at a prius diver "quit wasting so much gas you cocksucker" " is well worthy of consideration 'cuz we all know everyone driving a prius is a self righteous cocksucker to begin with...
...either way, red, rest assured ya'll (not bad for a yankee, huh ???) can be proud of yer cycling & verbal exploits...
..."female mini-van drivers are stone deaf and stupid so it doesn't fucking matter what you yell at them."...good point, surly bastard & one i overlooked...
CC: First you would have to be at war with someone, in order to have prisoners to mistreat. Like when is that gonna happen? eh? I guess you could fashion a proxy scandal by using all the folks that were arrested for discourteous behavior, but it just doesn't have the same kinda gusto as using full-blown war criminals.
Speaking of mini-vans & morals, having a dilemma regarding my volunteering with the ToM. If they ask me to drive, I should really tell them no cuz I don't think I can handle a passenger van but oh, the opportunity to have one of the teams to myself for awhile is tempting. But then again, I don't wanna be the one who wrecks the friggin' van with the Saxo boys or Quikstep on board.
...red neckerson brought it to the table & i think it's worthy to discuss prius's & their overwhelmingly "self righteous" attitude-y drivers...
...(this is not a scientific study, so this prob'ly only encompasses 99% of 'em...there's a few out there that "get it")...
...actual fact:- here in california, to encourage the use of "alternative source" vehicles, it was decided years ago & a law was passed to allow single occupant vehicles of a "green" nature, ie: prius's, honda insight's, which were certified by the e.p.a. to travel in the "commute lane" during "rush hours" to reward & encourage them for their active environmental participation...
...actual fact:- gov terminator has since rescinded that law...why ???...because rather than utilizing the privilege as intended, the majority of said drivers simply clogged the commute lane without consideration for "speed of traffic" flow...
...bgw speculation:- i contend that these self righteous "simple minded greenies" are actually one reason we are concerned about overall rising world temperatures...
...the "constantly being irked" & the fomenting ire n' anger of being stuck behind one of these blithe idiots & their "I'M saving the world" attitude is raising our blood pressures & our core body temperatures...
...need i say more ???...somewhere, a little penguin or maybe a polar bear cub aren't gonna make it this year & you can blame those "concerned" self righteous "environmentally active" "cocksuckers"...
Frilly: go for it, you'll be fine. It's an opportunity which could lead to greater things or at least fine memories. If you are worried about the driving, go rent a passenger van and do a complimentary delivery service in your city and get the feel for how it handles.
...damn...got to my local natural food store a few hours after posting about prius's & low & behold there were five, count 'em 5 sitting there side by side...
Whatever, they all sound like they need to be drained with a nine gauge needle and followed up with a strong regime of antibiotics.
...that might be a good solution...they weren't there as a group, it was pure happenstance & every one a' the drivers looked like the type that would be clogging up the works, somewhere down the road...
BGW: typically "X" marks the spot, in this case it is the spot where you might substitute a particular value for the general placeholder value. It can also stand for "was a one time", as in ex-champion, but that has a different syntactic aesthetic, but sounds the same.
...are the psychological ramifications not obvious here...surely you can see that despite my seemingly not wanting to shoot for the podium on a regular basis, the truth is...
...& i wanna throw bernard hinault off the podium just 'cuz i'll be there so often that he'll bother me...
BGW: you are among friends here...feel free to bear your soul...there could be no inadvertent repercussions...you are safe...you are on the internet...let'er rip...
...it all started w/ that first red raleigh 3sp & vittorio de sica's "ladri di bicyclette" (the bicycle thief)...but "pee-wee's BIG adventure" really brought it home...
...for some, it was "breaking away w/ ("papa, papa, i'm italiano")or even "american flyers" (sheesh) but no, for me, ya, it was pee-wee that really brought the message home...
...that single minded focus, that drive, that determination & in the end he'd not only ridden past those tour de france guys but he got his bike & his girl back...
...that's a powerful message & i started thinkin' "hmmm, bet i'd look good in yellow after a month in france"...
...well, needless to say, that never happened but w/ a little focus, a little determination & a reset button, dammit i can make the podium...
I saw that. How many races has he finished this year? There's rumors out there that he might take a DS position with BMC. I'd love to see him playing DS, but not just yet.
Seeing as you have managed to "break through" almost entirely on your own steam... I thought I should step in and help you get some "closure".
Have a nice one, BSNYC. We'll miss you. You may like this article btw haha : http://tinyurl.com/nuvtwa
...ant1...horner has gotten more miles in than robbie mcewan this season but damned if they're both not snakebit...
...it's a shame 'cuz they're both nearing the end of good careers & horner in particular seemed "on point" to get those results he deserves...
CC: First you would have to be at war with someone, in order to have prisoners to mistreat...So would you consider drinking a Labatt? or a Moosehead?
Canada is currently at war in Afghanistan, defending democracy and the right of rape within marriage. Get off the plane, step on a mine, and you're a "hero", and people cry like it was all unavoidable.
Anon 2:27: I think CC stands for courtesy, fair treatment of farm animals and the right to marry your sister.
DJIA is at 9318 right now. When it reaches +-10pts. That's the starting gun. Best of luck to everyone...
..."1.) Linked to the DJIA, as soon as it gains or drops 5% or gets over some value."...bleeh !!!...
...more importantly...anon 2:27pm instigated the days podium dash by asking "can anyone tell me what commiecanuk stands for...???"...
...hey...i didn't introduce this into the by-laws but nonetheless here it stands..."3.) Linked to the first Anon asking what X is? (X= RTMS, diktats, etc...)"...
...i'd have my lawyer explain this to ya but the ex-attorney general is too busy trying to murder cyclists up in toronto w/ his saab...
BGW: I guess you were the first in the Anon triggered race, Wes was first in the DJIA triggered race. (really though, since the race format had not been ratified into law, it's hard to say that any one of us is victor or vanquished)
I like the DJIA because it is more random and less prone to manipulation. If there is a better trigger, please advise.
I get my stock quotes on my ticker tape machine. I feel I am at a bit of a disadvantage. Maybe it's time to upgrade...to a crabon fibre ticker tape machine!
Mr. Gomez: while carbon tape would be lighter, more horizontally rigid and vertically compliant, it is more to the point that the engine behind the tape's production is the real source of your disadvantage. Now if you meant that you were going to upgrade the engine of your device to crabon fibre, then yes, please with all haste, upgrade. You may not actually gain any speed, but it will look awesome in the clubhouse.
does the race reset now, or do we have to wait for the first "what does X stand for?" after a certain time, like noon eastern tomorow?
...therefore, what say the reset is based on the ***sun's*** both setting & then rising again which gives you east coasters a definite advantage ???...(but don't look over yer shoulder & never, ever count me out, dammit !!!)...
...as far as today is concerned ???, re:- "BGW: I guess you were the first in the Anon triggered race, Wes was first in the DJIA triggered race. (really though, since the race format had not been ratified into law, it's hard to say that any one of us is victor or vanquished)"...ever heard the expression "possession is 9/10 of the law" ???...
...recognize that guy standing next to moi ???...gentlemen, i assume you know monsieur bernard hinault ???...i suggest you hold yer places & don't even think about it !!!...
...so, i'll assume this forum is now open to discussion as regards race format initialization...& personally i hate the idea & find it highly ironic, that on bsnyc/rtms, anyone would drag the stock market & it's business-eeze through these august halls...
BGW: the DJIA is a daily proxy(qualifying under the sun-down/sun-up criteria) for our beloved regular trigger, taking the weekend off, as does our snob. I think that the Great Author would acknowledge the practical utility of the DJIA trigger as a useful stand-in.
I would like to say that if we do accept the DJIA as the trigger, that the next days race trigger criteria will be given by the winner of the previous days race.
...while i'm insistent on claiming today's (wednesday) post w/ the backing of the 'podium poseur tossing monsieur hinault,as per a format set by others, i certainly don't feel the need to be one who insists on thursday's format...
...personally i'm good w/ hillbilly's suggestion that red neckerson act as the trigger...i'd say when you hear that music from "deliverance", head for the line...the podium's waitin'...
...my only concern, however, as regards the constituents of 'viper' is the uttering of that word..."trigger"...i just don't want anybody gettin' shot over the internet 'cuz red neckerson, jolene or ol' ricky gets excited & starts firin' off a few rounds...
BGW: how about the word actuator instead of trigger with respect to Mr. Redneckerson...it carries more of the engineer chic that is so popular with the kids these days.
HB: Load up on whatever you want, it's an all-drug race. I'm wearing my Amgen "EPO's alright by me" kit and riding my AMORFIX LIFE SCIENCES LTD bike (they do all my blood transfusions). So pop a few and get on board...
...suffer1st...'actuator' is good...if we keep up w/ the 'trigger' thingy, next we'd hear from the roy rogers lobby about improper blah, blah, blah & who needs the pressure...
...as far as "engineer chic" ???...one a' those days when i'm chasing those damn kids off a' my lawn, that 'pants down around their ass' thingy is gonna trip one of 'em up & then there's gonna be hell to pay, dad gummit...
...milkshake ???...hell, that's a power smoothie made w/ the finest natural ingredients...well, that & a few of those awesome 'amgen' products which keep me "dancing on the pedals" (thank you, phil)...
BGW: no wonder they wanna get at your stuff...it sounds pretty potent...keep dancing on them pedals/petals/peddles etc....
I am slowly morphing into the old man mode myself. No kids in the yard just yet, but the neighbors cats are really starting to get to me.
Rye Whiskey, the original whiskey sold through Seagram's (Bronfman's)through Al Capone and used in a Manhattan during prohibition, then later replaced by Bourbon, or turpentine (same taste).
CC:Thanks for the info, this dispels all those nasty rumors about Zima being the drink of choice in the Great Northern Nation of Cananda...
You have no idea what shit-storm is occurring over this. The press is now interviewing bike messengers to uncover the hidden alternative sub-culture, using terms like "alley cats", "fixed gear" and "territory marking". Massive street protests by cyclist who don't even know or care that they guy killed was some 33 year old loser, who previously was in a drunken fight with his girlfriend, and decided to attack a car bare-handed and hang on to the bumper. This asshole just happened to meet up with the head asshole, the former attorney general.
So far, I've heard 5 bike culture stories on radio and TV, and 3 ex-girlfriends, one who he knocked-up and left. This guy had the kvorka.
So that's what happened to Grizzly Adams. And why does Mr. Mullet in the back row get a gold bowtie?
Oh, and you could touch the dancers. I remember my older sister sneaking me in w/a fake ID. One of those idiots actually cleaned her glasses with his schlong. I threw up about five minutes later & remained a virgin until age 21. Post traumatic stress syndrome.
While I love cycling and embrace it in all its forms, I'm also extremely critical. So I present to you my venting for your amusement and betterment. No offense meant to the critiqued. Always keep riding!

Type 1 diabetes and the food intolerance disorder coeliac disease appear to share a common genetic origin, UK research suggests.
The genetic similarities are such it suggests they may also be triggered by similar environmental factors.
This raises the possibility that the protein gluten, already known to cause coeliac disease, may also trigger type 1 diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes causes the body to attack the beta cells of the pancreas, limiting its ability to produce the insulin necessary to regulate blood sugar levels.
In addition, the development and anatomy of the small intestine and pancreas are closely related, and the gut immune system shares connections with pancreatic lymph nodes, which have been linked to an inflammation of the pancreas and the destruction of beta cells.
The researchers, from the University of Cambridge and Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, analysed nearly 20,000 tissue samples to look for genetic similarities between the two conditions.
The key regions are thought to regulate the mechanisms that cause the body's own immune system to attack both the beta cells in the pancreas and the small intestine.
The researchers said more work was needed to pinpoint how genetic and environmental factors combined to trigger the conditions.
The researchers stressed the interaction was likely to be complex, but suggested that the same sort of environmental factors were likely to trigger both conditions.
In the paper, they write: "Our results support further evaluation of the hypothesis that cereal and gluten consumption might be an environmental factor in type 1 diabetes, leading to the alteration of the function of the gut immune system and its relationship with the pancreatic immune system."
Researcher Professor David van Heel said: "These findings suggest common mechanisms causing both coeliac and type 1 diabetes - we did not expect to see this very high degree of shared genetic risk factors."
Karen Addington, of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which helped fund the study, "These studies demonstrate that type 1 diabetes and coeliac disease share far greater genetic overlap than had been appreciated; which helps explain the high prevalence of both conditions occurring simultaneously in an individual and may provide new avenues for understanding the cause and mechanisms of both conditions."
Sarah Sleet, of the charity Coeliac UK, described the research as a real advance in understanding a condition which is thought to do undiagnosed in many people.
Working with many AX solutions over the years, I have seen Parameter Sniffing in many solutions and the effect of "bad Execution Plans" in SQL Server, can be rather "not so nice" to all end users.
Most of the solutions I see have many companies or Legal Enteties (LE) as they are refered to in AX 2012, but the distribution of the data in shared tables, are very commonly skewed where one company or LE typically allocates 80 to 9x percent of the rows while 8 - 10 companies/LE contribute to the rest of the rows in individual shared tables. Microsoft introduced PARTITION as a new way of isolating companies or LE in AX 2012 R2 and this led to another column in most tables contributing to the parameter sniffing issue. AX 2012 R2 is designed to have several partitions and many LE each representing a balanced data distribution (each partition and Company/LE having roughly the same number of rows), but in real life, this is very seldom what customers end up with.
I would say that Parameter Sniffing is not a phenomen (it's in fact a SQL Server by design behaviour), but it tend to hit AX solutions very hard when the design criteria is not met. The x-factor lies in the fact that Microsoft utilizes Parameterized Queries heavily to make sure every Query is executed "the same way" (also the main reason for recommending MAXDOP = 1) each time and to reduce the number of SQL Compiles and Recompiles (has a small CPU cost). But the downside is that the actual value for the parameter when the statement reaches SQL Server for the first time (or the SQL Server is experiencing mamory pressure with flushing of execution plans), must represent "an average" partions and/or company/LE. The x-factor can simply be caused by the the first user logging on to AX the morning (early bird) after the AOS instances and/or SQL Server has been restarted and representing a small company with regards to the number of rows in shared tables, can "trick" SQL Server in generating a execution plan where SQL Server find it most efficent (based on the cost) to perform a table or index scan. When an user representing the largest company (number of rows in the underlying tables) implicitly reuses the same execution plan, all sorts of bad performance reports starts popping up. Looking at the SQL Server you will probably notice constantly high CPU utilization and digging a little further, You will probably identify one or several statements consuming much CPU time (some of then probably also beeing utilized by API Cursors).
Microsoft introduced a new feature in AX 2012 R2 CU6 to overcome this vulnerability and it's a kernel feature that's turned off by default. The feature is well described in the article Overcoming parameter sniffing issue in Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012-R2 – CU6 written by the AX Performance Team.
I have been aware of this rather important change (results in values for the columns PARTITION and DATAAREAID beeing always sent to SQL Server as literals or actual values instead of parameterized values), but I tend to await activation until I actually see (have proofe of) that a solution is impacted by Parameter Sniffing. Last week I saw proof of this happining in a busy solution focused around Sales Order processing and after activating the changes in the table SYSGLOBALCONFIGURATION followed by a stop - start sequence of the AOS instances, we imediately saw SQL Server generating execution plans using literals for the columns described which again "calmed" the solution. At the same time the number of SQL Compiles and Recompiles increased somewhat, but this was expected as the number of Execution Plans for each Parameterized Statement will increase by the product of the number of Partitions and the number of individual companies/LE utilizing a spesific module in AX.
This is perhaps one of the most important changes Microsoft has introduced and I have not seen any other solution improving (trace flags, force literals keyword etc.) or near eliminating this issue until this feature was introduced. Everyone involved in implementing AX 2012 solutions should be aware of this and be able to utilize this feature when needed. I say AX 2012 since MS stated that this change was expected to be back ported to AX 2012 (I don't know the status), but it's confirmed in AX 2012 R2 CU6 and later binary builds. Customers still utilizing AX 4.0 or AX 2009, will probably never benefit from this feature.
Many factors play a part in this story such as SQL Server Statistics, Max Degree of Parallism and API Cursors, but this is the single most efficent method of helping SQL Server generating the most representative (balanced) Execution Plans for AX based on my experience.
I saw Axapta 1.5 back in 2001 and have been working with Axapta 2.5 and Axapta 3.0 in the period 2002 to 2005, AX 4.0 and 2009 from 2007 and of course AX 2012 R0/1/2/3 from 2011.

This is just a quick heads up for those of you who haven't seen Esilance's forum post about the long awaited and highly anticipated firmware update (20.2.019) for the Nokia N97.
Latest firmware update for company's flagship device is now available as FOTA update and through Nokia Software Updater as well for most of the generic product codes from EMEA and APAC region and is expected to be available for the rest of the world as well as for NAM and branded devices shortly.
Firmware v20 improves touch screen usability, allowing you to scroll smoothly through content by flicking the screen. Ovi Maps 3.1 brings 3-D maps, more accurate positioning, and improved search. Nokia e-mail, Ovi Contacts, Ovi Store, and VoIP support have been added. This release also includes improvements in memory and battery performance, and in image and video stability.
Last but not the least, new software is CONFIRMED AS HACKABLE with the latest available method, s so there is really no reason not to update it.
Oh yes, one more thing, Nokia N97 comes with UDP support but it is anyway highly suggestible to back up your phone memory before performing a firmware update as precaution measure in case something goes wrong.
To get this software through your device, select Applications > SW Updates and choose the software you want to update. Alternatively, this software release is available through the Nokia Software Updater.
Window shopping can get as boring as the sheer fact of doing that, yet on special occasions it can bring a lot of interesting finds. But it would be a shameless lie to say that I haven’t looked forward to this particular photo oriented flagship smartphone to finally materialize in UK mobile shops. And now, after having seen the new toy in ‘person’ and gathered as much impressions as humanly possible in 5 minutes, I feel like my initial skepticism towards Sony Ericsson’s Satio shouldn’t go unpunished for various reasons.
At the very core, Satio (also known as Idou) is the latest Sony Ericsson’s weapon of choice in the crowded multimedia smartphone segment.
A noteworthy fact is that it’s the very first phone from the Japan and Swedish joint company to see the S60 treatment, the touch oriented Symbian 5th edition operating system to be precise. After outsourcing of Symbian platform and making it more accessible to other major players at no additional costs, Nokia basically left the mobile industry in guessing about what will happen next. While this is definitely worthy a more in-depth article, for now it’s suffice to say that Nokia in a smartly fashion moved it’s focus away from Symbian to a seemingly more perspective in future growth platform for their high-end products, and naturally, that’s exactly where Maemo OS comes in.
It didn’t take too long for competing companies to capitalize on the opportunity to use Symbian as a software platform for their own flagship products, however the means of rival companies choose to fight for the supremacy in higher segment – faster processors, better screens or more megapixels – hardware, in short, may very well be flawed idea by design. Why is that even relevant to Satio?
A quick glance over to the closest rival’s short-lived fate – the Samsung I8910HD – and it becomes clear, that Symbian OS is no longer viewed as an effective way to gain more ground on the still fairly solid in demand higher-tier phones segment. So, from that point alone, Satio is an interesting product, an attempt to make touch-screened Symbian phone as attractive as possible to anyone who seeks a competent smartphone in the highly competitive world of the iPhone and Android OS counterparts.
So without further pondering on whether Symbian is getting enough attention from 3rd party developers or whether it creates enough friction to stay relevant in the long run, let’s finally take a closer look at what is certainly a curios looking full touch-screen phone, the Sony Ericsson Satio.

Hello! Today I bring you another chapter of “Baka de Guzu wa Daikirai”. Why so fast? Well first because it’s a small chapter of only 13 pages, so it was super fast to bring it to the light. Second because there are a lot of people asking what will go happen to Haru as well Soudai. As well people saying Haru to get another guy and as to Soudai get a grip and go to h&%3. So in this chapter, even if small, you will see a “I don’t care anymore” Haru and a shocked Soudai. Also next chapter everything will be decided. Will Haru give up and keep his life? Will Soudai finally confess to Haru? Please await for the next chapter to come where every question will finally have an answer.
Haha I mostly don’t know what’s going on in this chapter, but I’m looking forward to it making more sense with the next. ^^ Thanks so much!
Noooooo, I want to know what happens next, lol. Thank you so much for this chapter, it’s amazing that you guys were able to get out another chapter so quickly. I can’t wait to read the next chapter. Hooray for Haru and not moping around after Soudai.
thank you for the release. your hard work is much appreciated. until we meet again best wishes & regards.

We’re about half-way through our season-long attendance of the Houston Rodeo, and it’s been pretty fun, albeit a little repetitive. Basically each night we see the rodeo events immediately followed by the live performances.
The rodeo events 1 have been my favourite things to see so far, particularly the Mutton Bustin’ and Calf Scramble, but the horse and bull riding has been impressive.
I think I’d give it a miss in the coming years, or at least go for one full Saturday or Sunday 2 to get my fill of fried food (including butter!), bacon-wrapped sausage, and funnel cakes.
Also, better opportunities for photography can be had during the day 3. Here’s a quick collection of pics I’ve taken so far. Most of these were taken this past Sunday. (Quite a few of these felt like they warranted a B+W conversion, so I did them all. I think they’re better for it (although I’ll likely post a final gallery with colour photos once the Rodeo is over)).

Trinity and regard Jesus only as a prophet, not as a god. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2009. Lockes understanding of the monotheistic prophetic tradition culminating in Islam was almost identical to the Socinian and anti-Trinitarians historical scheme. Such a position would pitch Locke against the Socinian point of view of Christ. 32 Edwards is remembered today as a teacher and missionary by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on March. God of Grace, God of Glory: The Theology of Jonathan Edwards. Moreover although the universities were said to be different from the madrasas which had been established throughout the Muslim world in the tenth and eleventh centuries, there were significant parallels between the system of education in Islam and that of the Christian West. In 1749, he published a memoir of David Brainerd who had lived with his family for several months and had died at Northampton in 1747. John Marshall argues, Indeed, given his apparently contemporaneous Socinian reading and composition of the EssayLocke had the Trinity in his mind in composing the Essay, a series of linked arguments about essay about team building the difficulties of assenting to a true faith. The scholastics, mostly church theologians, tended towards determinism or predestination while the medieval humanists, like Muslim Muatazilites, emphasized individual subjective consciousness and freedom of choice.
A council was convened to decide the communion matter between the minister and his people. Since Alexander the Great in the 4th Century BC, the Hellenistic culture had spread to Persia.

They tend to obliterate the influence of Arabs and Muslims upon scholasticism while the scholastics themselves considered Arabic learning to be an important part of their intellectual legacy Scholasticism was considered a kind of Aristotelianism and the scholastics knew the important role played by Muslim. There are existent correspondences between Lutherans in Flanders and Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and his successor Sultan Murad III. Therefore, Islamic theological and philosophical ideas were an integral part of the unfinished reformation as well as the finished reformation which heralded the 18th century Enlightenment.

SMOD13 is a complete remake of the classic SMOD from scratch with the goal to bring the awesome SMOD experience we all enjoyed onto the newest 2013 with most of all of the classic features back plus a plethora of new and streamlined features with the goal to make SMOD even more modable and fun than it was before! We not only want to bring SMOD back but re-light the fire in the community that was once extremely active with people discovering the mod for the first time and tinkering with it to their hearts content to make some really amazing things! We want SMOD13 to feel fresh and brand new so that old and new faces from the community will feel like they're diving back into it for the very first time.
Though SMOD13 is mainly maintained and created by Rara we have a good handful of people who have/are doing some amazing work to help make this project possible and would not have gotten this far without them, period.
Rara - Head Coder and Project Lead {The head and heart of the project, without Rara the project would not exist!} [Rara#2992]
The Renegadist - Mod Manager + Input Lead {Helping manage the mod as well as getting the word out and providing input} [The Renegadist#4752]
Msalinas - Secondary Coder {Has been a gigantic help with the Mapadd system and more to come, very talented coder and has saved our asses multiple times!} [Msalinas#2865]
Arthurdead - Thirdendary Coder {An awesome coder who has not only helped us many times but is now officially part of the project!} [Arthurdead#8326]
sparrowstar - Coding Help {Sparrowstar has been very helpful with bits and pieces of code and will hopefully stick with us for help down the line} [sparrowstar#6112]
Joshy - Coding Consultation {Has given us a few tips and pointers which have gotten us into the right direction} [Joshy#8460]
Bitl - Firefight Reloaded Code {Provided us with the source code for FR which has not only helped us a ton concerning mapadd but also with other SMOD related code} [ Bitl#3305]
SirMasters - SMMOD Code {Helped us a ton by making his code for SMMOD open source so we could use it as a reference}
The ability to play through Half-Life: Source, Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode 1, Half-Life 2: Episode 2, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, and many many mods, custom maps, and more in SMOD13 (WIP)
Several original SMOD weapons ported including the kick and some new weapons including the elite and Uzi (WIP)
A new and robust custom weapons system that not only allows for an infinite amount of custom weapons but it's more streamlined to make things easier for the modder
A more updated and faster version of LUA that is similar to what Garry's Mod uses but is more directly connected to the engine. If you could do it in C++ with the engine, you can do it with LUA!
The rest of SMOD's original weapons + a bunch of new ones to only add to the carnage that can be dealt to your enemies
SMOD's incredibly brutal gore and blood system but updated and improved upon to maximize the devestation that can be unleashed! (Particle Expert needed!)
An improved menu UI that will look more polished and will include a better chapter/custom level screen removing the need for editing chapter files or loading maps in the console
A HUD system where players can have several HUD's in the game at one time and can choose which is displayed in-game
All official videos and what not will be posted here for convenience sake, nothing in these videos is final and may be removed, redone, or improved in the future!
Hope this got people hyped for the project, it would be phenomenal to see SMOD back alive and kicking in a much more stable state and with this project we hope to achieve that!
If you'd like to participate in active development/discussion then join the Source Modding Community and once you are a member hit up our channel at #mod-hl2_smod13 , Discord link here: https://discord.gg/FgsCdR9.
We currently don't have a publicly available download as we're still developing it behind closed doors but the plan is to release a beta once we have the core features added and we will be releasing the source code once the mod is finished and is fully public!
We are also in the process of finding a Particle designer to work on a couple particle systems for some of the effects and the blood/gore system so if you know a guy that knows a guy then let us know!
Finally, once we get something super legit going we're hoping to get our own sub-forum on the forums but we'd like to wait until a release is put out. Thanks guys and happy SMOD'ing!
For almost a year now I have been running a Discord server with a fellow owner and a small staff team called the Source Modding Community hence the title of the post. The goal of the Discord server is to provide a place for Valve modders to come together to discuss modding, ask and answer questions, showcase their mods and WIP's, and more. Currently we are over four hundred members strong with some very familiar places from around the Gldsrc and Source modding community as well as other places from the gaming world. Right now we have a system where people can receive custom roles depending on what they are talented at such as Level Designers, Audio Engineers, and so on. By giving people these roles other modders can contact them for help and these members can offer their services to mods making everything run like one big machine. Modders can also request to make their own text channels for discussing their projects with the rest of the server, find help, and show off any WIP content to get people interested in what they are doing. Currently as of this email our list of WIP mods mainly stem from Half-Life 1, Half-Life 2, and Portal 2 however if we get people who mod other games such as Left 4 Dead 1 & 2 or CSGO and the community shows interest we will open mod channels up for those games as well. It would also be cool to see some SMOD related channels on here so people can showcase any WIP mods and get feedback and whatnot from the rest of the community.
Even if you aren't working on an SMOD mod feel free to join to discuss other mod projects or to just hang out with the rest of the community. Hope to see some of you cool cats on there!
Note: All new members must contact a staff member or leave a message on the "new-member-hub" asking for membership + any special roles, this is to prevent ban evasion and gives people a chance to view what the server has to offer without being an official member.
Bitl has released FIREFIGHT RELOADED to Steam Greenlight! He promises for the Steam version to be identical to the mod version, plus with native Achievement and Workshop support! Also, as he said before, the mod will be 100% free on both the Steam and mod versions!
Also, the mod recently had a BIG update that adds in Manhacks and adds some new features. Check it out here:
Pepsifan04 has now set up a TeamSpeak server for the community to use. You will need to download TeamSpeak3 (not 2). The connection information is below so you can join the server and chat. Once again big thanks to Pepsifan04! Give him some
xdanielx52: If you did not changed anything, then i guess Crowbar uses some "informations" that steam might have changed (steam also breaks stuff while updating itself). Other than that i have no idea where the real problem could be.
minmi96: I keep getting this Error Message every time I try to compile a Model: Can't find steam app user info.
minmi96: I was using Crowbar to compile and decompile Models for SMOD, and 2 days ago it decided to break for me like an arsehole.
Pepsifan04: Apparently SMF (forum engine) does not like https links, if you replace https with http you should be fine
xdanielx52: Why am i not able to change my profile picture that is specified by a link (*.gif)? I'm pasting the link into the box and then clicking on saving afterwards. But after reloading the page, my link is gone and the option is set to use no picture at all :/
minmi96: Has anybody ever tried to recreate the BFG from Doom or the Railgun from the Quake Series as SMOD Weapons?
xdanielx52: i guess he means a smod version ready to mod but without the pre-installed content from smod (models, weapons, sounds etc.)
Also with GDPR in place, people should be careful pubically displaying other people's email addresses or other personal information.
He post his own information of his own accord, you can’t go posting people private or company email addresses.
The best way we can increase crowds at the moment is by talking to friends, family and work colleagues. If they do show any interest in turning up for a match at least you can warn them about the state of the car park and toilet facilities.
Once the directors have spoken to JLR and we know whether we're staying at the ATG, or not, then we'll need ideas on getting new supporters interested.
One way of attracting fans would be if we could get Tim Flowers, Darren Carter and perhaps Annie Zaidi to go to local schools and provide football coaching then dish out some free tickets.

Hopefully this does lead to " Avenues of new Opportunities " , to increase the Fanbase and indeed Revenue.
Think regular Q & A Forums with the Directors and Supporters would be very useful - Monthly / Bi Monthly.

Thanks to Marvin Carlson for pointing out this intelligent interview with Iman Aoun, artistic director of the Ashtar theatre group in Palestine, done by Sarah Irving at Electronic Intifada. The conversation gets into issues of language (classical vs. colloquial), interpretation, local reception, and normalization vs. BDS. Here's one interesting exchange:
SI: Some of the other Shakespeare plays being performed in Arabic during Globe 2 Globe — such as an Iraqi version of Romeo and Juliet set in Baghdad — are very obviously trying to take Shakespeare’s drama and find specific Arab settings for it. Is this what Ashtar has tried to do with Richard II? Or have you left it more to audience to see for itself the modern message that the play might have?
IA: I think we have attempted to do the second. We have tried to be very faithful to the story and to the text itself. We did not add to it, we did not change it. We tried to put it in a modern setting in terms of the costume and flavor, very subtly, you cannot really see one place in our performance, but you could sense, if you want, many places. It is anywhere there is political turmoil, the greed of power. Yes, at some point you could see a Palestinian dress onstage, or you could see people dressed in Middle Eastern outfits, but it does not particularly say that this is happening here in Palestine or in a particular Arab city. We want the audience to concentrate and think.
"Fidelity" discourse aside (and we can easily see that as the counterswing of a certain pendulum), it sounds really worth seeing. One of the peculiarities of the Globe festival is that companies are asked to create these plays essentially on speculation -- for just a few UK performances and maybe one or two back home -- and then hope someone picks it up. It would be so great if this play, since it appears to be really good and not just ethnographically curious, could tour to the US somewhere. Are you listening, Chicago?
many thanks for commenting on this article, and for your kind words. The London production was excellent; even an extremely rigorous and critical Arabic-lit-crit friend who came to see it was very impressed - especially by Sami Metwasi's excellent take on the character of Richard. Well worth seeing for anyone in Oxford, UK on May 7th and at any future performances...

Uber and Airbnb are sharing economies that enable the average person to make profit by sharing something they own. Usually the customer saves more money by using these services and at the same time it’s more flexible and convenient. People that make money from this model are similar to freelancers. The only thing these companies have not provided for the person is training on how to advertise, grow and scale their business.
IPN takes an individual and gives them the tools and training they need in order to become an entrepreneur and a successful business owner. IPN also provides a platform called “The IPN Economy” which offers experienced and inexperienced business owners a opportunity to profit by marketing and selling good and services.
Businesses will have access to a network of customers and those customers will have access to products at a discount. One of the industries IPN will disrupt is the Retail industry through the sharing economy model.
Whether you are an employee or a self employed freelancer you are still limited by time and money. However if you are plugged into a system that helps develop business owners, then the possibilities for you to attain freedom increase.
Uber and Airbnb offer individuals the ability to become freelancers while IPN offers individuals freedom. It’s your business - own it.

The rooms are ok, but no toothbrush, no toothpaste, no even comb, no free WiFi, the electric kettle is dirty, couldn’t boil water.. I paid for extra bed plus extra breakfast for 1 person but at the restaurant for breakfast, they still charged.... the female receptionist is more friendly than male... the good points is only closed to Indra square... will not consider to stay there again.
The hotel saves on all major facilities. It may be 4 Star but there are gaping holes in facilities provided. Ac temperature in the room is permanently set. limited toiletries in bathroom. Reception un friendly??
The buffet didnt have a huge variety of food and NO bacon, plus I had hair in my food so no I wasn t completely happy. The rooms where beautiful but a lot of noise coming from other families and them leaving their doors open whilst they ate making the foyers stink not a great experience there.

Introduction: Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a serious and expected complication in almost every patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Nevertheless brown tumors formed by osteoclasts are rarely found in this subtype of patients and are extremely rare in children with CKD. The most common localizations of brown tumors are the jaw and long bones. We aimed to present three clinical cases of brown tumors in children with CKD on hemodialysis observed in a single dialysis center for a period of 30 years.
Material and methods: Three children with CKD on hemodialysis were diagnosed as having brown tumors using clinical, laboratory and instrumental methods of investigations.
Results: Four years after the initiation of the hemodialysis treatment the first child presented with pain in the bones with valgus deformation in the knee joints. After 1 and a half year two brown tumors were found in the lower and upper jaw which grew up to 6 and extended to the facial bones with cyst-like bone lesions. Their size ranged between 1 and 8 cm. The laboratory results showed relative hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels elevated 25 times more than the reference range. On ultrasound examination there was a hyperplasia of the right inferior parathyroid gland. In the second child 4 years after the initiation of the hemodialysis treatment there was pain in the bones with valgus deformation in the knee joints. After 1 year two brown tumors were found in the lower jaw which size was around 1 cm. The laboratory and radiographic results were similar to that in the first child and on ultrasound examination there was a hyperplasia of the two inferior parathyroid glands. The third child presented with pain and tumor formation in the upper part of the right femur 4 years after the initiation of the hemodialysis and soon after a lesion in the upper left femur appeared. The MRI results confirmed the diagnosis of brown tumors.
Conclusion: Brown tumors are a very rare complication in children with CKD on hemodialysis and should be taken in mind in cases of bone pain and deformities. Laboratory and imaging methods of investigations should be used when suspecting the diagnosis and histological examination could be used to confirm their presence in the bones.

Annapurna Massif, which extends about 55 km in length is a collection of over 30 mountain peaks. Prominent peaks among them include Annapurna I, II, III, IV and Gangapurna. The highest among them and the most popular is Annapurna I which is 8091m tall, recognized as the tenth highest mountain in the world. There are over 16 peaks over 7000m and around 13 peaks that are 6000m above in height.
Annapurna I is considered to be one of the most dangerous mountain to climb after Kanchenjunga and K2. The climbing of Annapurna features pretty steep climbs, glacier walking, risks of avalanches and trailing by way of fixed ropes. The dangers of frostbite and gangrene on the ascent are maximum on the Annapurna. Annapurna I was the first 8000m to be climbed via Southeast ridge in 1950 by a French expedition headed by Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal among others. The south face of Annapurna was first climbed in 1970 by a British expedition led by Chris Bonington.
Day 01: Arrival at Kathmandu International Airport and transfer to hotel. Stay overnight at hotel in Kathmandu.
You drive along the Kathmandu-Pokhara Highway to Dumre and then follow the narrow and paved road by the Marshyangdi River to Besisahar (823m.). It takes almost seven hours. Beshishahar is the district headquarters of Lamjung district. All the local government offices are situated here. From here, you can see some mountain peaks, natural sceneries surrounding the valley and the daily activities of local people. Stay overnight at lodge.
With Lamjung Himal (6893m) sparkling in the morning sun, you set off for Pisang. You continue through a fir and pine forest, climbing to a high, rocky area as the opposite bank becomes an impassable cliff. From this point, the valley becomes extremely steep-sided as you follow the path to Bratang. A short climb from the village brings you to a rock-strewn area where you cross a wooden bridge and follow a high, winding path, before crossing back to the right bank again. You can see the east peak of Annapurna II as well as Pisang Peak to the north-east. Continuing on, you come to a long Mani wall by a bridge and the lower village of Pisang. Stay overnight at lodge.
You start early today to cross the Thorong La (5416m). The trail becomes steep but as local people have used this trail for hundreds of years, the path is well defined. The gradient then eases and after around 4 hours of steady climbing, you reach the chorten and prayer flags of the pass. The views are dramatic to say the least, from the snow-covered mountains above, to the head of the Kali Gandaki valley below and the brown and purple hills of Mustang which are spread out before us. The descent to Muktinath is a knee pounding 1600m but it is compensated with excellent views of Dhaulagiri. Eventually, the moraines give way to grassy slopes before a pleasant walk along the Jhong Khola Valley to Muktinath and its shrines and temple. Stay overnight at lodge.
You now begin the descent path down the dramatic Kali Gandaki Gorge, initially through arid country in the same geographical and climatic zone as Tibet. After passing through Jharkot and Khingar, villages with typical Tibetan architecture, you follow the valley floor most of the way to Jomsom. Jomsom is sprawled along both banks of the Kali Gandaki and from here there are fine views of the Nilgiri peaks. You continue down to Marpha, a delightful Thakali village, complete with a drainage system beneath the flagstone streets. Its narrow alleys and passageways provide welcome shelter from the strong winds of the Kali Gandaki Gorge and Marpha is particularly well known for its apples, apple cider and juice, apricot and peach brandy. Stay overnight at lodge.
The flights are available during the morning time. The strong breeze blows during and after the trip and frequent change of the weather sometimes prevents flight landing and take-off in the afternoon. During the flights in morning, the skies are very clear which makes you able to enjoy the splendid views of different mountain peaks. Stay overnight at hotel in Pokhara.
Drive from Pokhara to Kathmandu by tourist mini bus that takes about seven hours. While driving from Pokhara to Kathmandu, you head up to Damauli, Dumre, Muglin and Kurintar where Nepal's first Cable car is operated to reach to Manakamana Temple. En route, you can enjoy the mountain views, green sceneries, rice terrace fields, vegetable fields and people being engaged in their daily life activities. From Naubishe you climb up to Thankot, the gateway to the capital city. You can also fly from Pokhara to Kathmandu which takes about 25 minutes.

Harvesting in Sublette, Kasas. This is the best of the best dry land crop…the fewest weeds. Most fields are yielding between 15-25 bushels per acre. Test weight is poor, often 56 lbs. We have heard of some in the 40s!
After 4-5″ of rain over most fields, we were surprised the mud was not worse. The John Deere combine is 4-wheel-drive and the ground had dried just enough to be able to push through and harvest the grain in most fields.
The final fields had more low spots, so we strategically left those fields last so they could dry up as much as possible. Still, standing water was easy to find and many passes had long stretches of mud. You couldn’t have harvested these areas without 4×4. The mud ads another layer of stress, takes a lot of effort to wash off such a large machine, and causes temporary panic attack when you nearly get stuck! We hope this is the last of the mud for 2018 harvest, but are thankful to have a machine capable of handling these tough scenarios.
The worst of the worst….an example of an abandoned field that will never be harvested. Such thin, poor wheat was easily overtaken by weeds after plentiful rain accelerated their growth. It’s sad to try and understand how discouraging this must make local farmers feel…a lot of money, hard work and planning went into raising this crop with nothing in return. No doubt there will be plenty of financial stress to shoulder as farmers will have staggeringly low incomes from their wheat crop this year.
An all-too-common site while harvesting here in SW Kansas. Too much wet, weedy material and not enough dry wheat straw to mix in and allow the machine to discharge the material out the straw chopper. This has to be cleaned out by hand, and I have the green-stained skin on my arms to prove it! How long will it take for my skin to return to it’s normal shade? These weeds have created a lot of heartache for everyone this year…
A ground-level view of the short, thin wheat. Cutting so close to the ground becomes very challenging, and that forces the machine to intake more green, wet weeds…a recipe for disaster. See the plugged straw chopper photo above. Muddy ground conditions also mean the machine can quickly, and unexpectedly, sink into the ground. This forces the wheat head to make contact with the ground and increases the chance for getting dirt into the header. Just another time-robbing, back-breaking task on a 100 degree day…digging wet dirt out of the center of the header. This also proved to be an all-to-common heartache while harvesting. Lets hope weed-free, dry conditions lie ahead of us for the balance of the summer.

It is what is happening and what we as custom harvesters deal with, not only this year but many times over the years. Thank you
We really enjoy your stories and the time it takes for you to produce this blog online and in the Journal. I look forward to reading to see the progress. We as Adair County Iowa farmers are excited to finally find out what that Jones family is up to. Always interesting to find out how farmers in other parts of the country operate. Good Luck and God’s Blessings as you harvest along. Hope the conditions improve for you and for those farmers.
We harvested for 21 years and had many situations like you face now. It almost seems hopeless fighting mud and weeds at the same time. We really feel for you and understand what you’re up against
Brian, thank you for your good report about your harvesting issues. Sounds like your sinuses are plugged also. That makes for hard to breath and think. Hope the rest of the trip is smooth. You and your crew take care. Harry and Sharon Drake, south central kansas
Brian, 4WD is a great improvement in combines. Back when we ran L2’s, before Mud Hogs, 30.5×32 rice on backwards, spin in, till “no more”, try to back out, or get “long cabled out”. Unload I/2 bin, dig the mud out of the header, bust the mud from the wheel scrapers, check for mud damage, and go back at it again and again, until moisture got high. Hard on equipment and hard on people.
The problem was then trying to plow when the clay ground finally dried those 3 foot wide, 2 foot deep, dual canyons that careened, in all directions, across the fields. Often would take 8 hours to “creep, jump and bang” across 50 acres. The rut damages were visible two years later in the wheat stands and yields, on the combines for a lifetime.

Be stars are massive stars surrounded by an equatorial disk of material (a circumstellar disk). Roughly 2/3 of all high-mass x-ray binary systems consist of a Be star and a compact object in orbit around each other and, not surprisingly, these systems are known as Be X-ray binaries.
Be X-ray binaries are generally quiescent, exhibiting low-luminosity (in a few cases) or no X-ray emission. The transient X-ray outbursts are thought to be due to interactions between the compact object and the circumstellar disk surrounding the Be star, and two different types of outburst have been identified:
Type I outbursts tend to be short and periodic, occurring around periastron when the two objects are at their closest approach. This would suggest that the orbit of the compact object around the Be star is wide and highly eccentric, limiting interactions with the circumstellar disk to when the objects are closest. Type I outbursts typically last only a few days and are the result of an increase in the amount of material impacting the compact object as it passes through, or close to the circumstellar disk.
Type II outbursts are much larger than Type I outbursts and can last for several weeks. They are not linked to the orbital period of the system but tend to be preceeded by increased activity in the Be star. This can change the density, size and other characteristics of the circumstellar disk, which in turn will affect the X-ray emission as the compact object interacts with the disk material.
The projected semi-major axis, x, of a binary system is the projection of the semi-major axis onto the line of sight:
where i is the inclination angle of the binary orbit (with respect to the plane of the sky). This implies that orbits which are viewed face-on have x = 0, while for edge-on systems x equals the actual semi-major axis of the binary system.
This parameter is mostly important because of its direct relation to the Roemer delay, which enables its measurement through pulsar timing.

I was not impressed that there was no wi fi in the rooms for free. We had to buy wi fi and once you had bought wi fi you could only use it at the restaurant and the lobby only.
Security card for room and lift needed to be re activated 4 times.Above building noise started at 7.30 am impossible to sleep.
The room had poor quality. There were stains on the bedding and room were not cleaned the first day. Which meant for example that there was no toilet paper. The second day the room was cleaned but very bad, among other things there were pieces of glass in the carpet, cockroaches in the room. It is deplorable that the hotel charge 600 bath for 24 hour internet. No modern hotel does that today. Moreover, it did not work. The breakfast was under all criticism and under continental standard. We have stayed at Indra Regent previous nothing has happened over the years more than that, it got worse. This was unfortunately the last time.

Yet another year, come and gone. I hope the holidays are good to you and yours as snows accumulate more and more both outside and on our collective heads.
I still think of all of you often throughout the year but more during the Holiday Season. I just cannot forget all those memories of you during the holidays of 1975 and
This year, I think of my new found friend Billy Bils and his beautiful wife Michaela and handsome son Anthony from Nellingen, Germany. In July past I had the pleasure
of taking my wife Rose and daughter Natalie to Germany and all those places I had spoken to them about. We stayed at the Am-Scheltor in Esslingen and the Bils'
were kind enough to drive us around and invite us to dinner in their home. They live in Nellingen just outside what was the front gate of our barracks. Sadly, hardly
anything remains of the place where we all lived but the vibe is still there. Billy gave us a tour of where everything used to be. The only things that any of us would
recognize was the Rec Center and the building next to it where I once bought a harmonica. The Commanding General's office also remains. All else is gone. Even
the Strassenbahn behind La Paloma (also gone) no longer exists. The only remnant was a piece of track about 5 feet long. I remember taking a picture of Dave
walking along those tracks. However Stuttgart, Nellingen, Esslingen and the surrounding areas are still pretty much the same and beautiful as always. I can only
imagine how beautiful it must be during these days with the heavy snows Germany has had recently and the Christmas Market in Esslingen. They still have the open
air Farmer's Market there every Saturday throughout the year. The Bahnhof in Stuttgart still has the beautiful old decor but has been invaded by many shops including
McDonald's and Burger King. Bummer. We toured Munich and Dachau then went on to Paris and London. Thank you again Billy for the generosity and time you
extended to us. I enclose a few pictures for you and see if you recognize anything . . . especialy me.
I'm sure I have a few pictures of Nelligan Barraks somewhere. I'll have to dig them out, then scan them to my computer. After that, I'll send
you what I have. I was stationed there in 1984. After having been in country for about 8 months, the Army moved my unit, the 48th Aviation Co.(Blackhawks),

Well, THAT was a surprise. The game runs really smoothly, which is great, but the sound effects lack punch, which is less great. The voice sounds pretty constipated, and it's got the same issue with sudden changes in tone that the sound samples from MAME had. Now I get why they left the voice out of other conversions.

I think those are pretty minor complaints for a game that didn't need to exist and wouldn't have existed without some people taking on a passion project in their spare time to keep systems that haven't seen a retail shelf in 35 years alive. The fact that I am able to play an really kick ass version of Wizard of Wor TODAY in 2018 on my ColecoVision which I grew up with in 1982 is beyond a miracle.
I have nothing to complain about and IMO it's a shame that people will pick apart games like this as I feel it's totally undeserved.
Having made games myself in my gaming career (I was a producer on Sega Genesis Aladdin, PC 7th Guest, NES Jungle Book, SNES Lion King, just to name a few) I know exactly the challenges are of having an entire team working professionally for months on a game. This project here is just a couple of guys working in their spare time on a VERY technologically restricting system. Cut them some slack. If you want to play a the actual arcade ROM, boot up MAME. But for what I'm seeing on my screen coming out of my ColecoVision, I am DAMN IMPRESSED!!!!
That speech sounds just like it did in the arcade. I'd much prefer to have the original arcade speech than have it removed or have it changed in some fashion.
Wow that looks amazing.. I am so looking forward to this release from Pixelboy as I grew up with this game.
What did you think of the sound effects not including voice? Did the sound seem different to you or was it my poor speakers on my cheap VGA monitor? I thought the voice was spot on, but I also liked how the sound effects seemed to be toned down too.
I remember Wizard of Wor being a really loud game at the time and I am sure my household would appreciate if the laser ray sound of me dying over and over was not too much.. haha.
I miss the twinkling stars in the background, *BUT* I was extremely impressed at how fluid the animation is. I've got the arcade game on MAME and there is something different on the CV version--it is better! Also, the audio lacked a bit of a punch in the video but I'm sure on a good sound system it would sound more like the arcade (the arcade game actually had a pretty decent speaker setup for its time). I think the audio issue is more like the video capture equipment didn't capture it well.
Okay, credit where credit is due... it looks very good. The ColecoVision's higher resolution really sharpens up the graphics, making it look like the excellent Commodore 64 version.
That moment when you get all the Team Pixelboy Budget Series games in the mail and you go "Wait a minute...I don't remember ordering that one..."
Yes! Team Pixelboy threw in a bonus FREE totally unannounced surprise game for anyone who ordered more than ten of the budget series! (And it even came with overlays!)
And I'd also like to remind people that not only was this an amazing act of kindness, but don't forget that this entire budget series was done in an effort to help out a follow member of our community, Nanochess, as his family was going through some very difficult times.
Happy to support all the homebrewers and the members of the ColecoVision world! Thanks to all of you!
I appreciate very much the help of everyone with these budget games and in special of Pixelboy, he helped a buddy and his wife in hard times.
I totally did not know that Coleco ever made a box for Donkey Kong! I always thought they were reproductions. My Coleco was a Canadian version, and it was just the cart that came with it...even had a little spot molded out in the styrofoam. Even the collector box I picked up from the USA didn't have a box for DK, these must have been rare indeed.
Some European systems were packaged with Mouse Trap due to DK being a very popular game and therefore would sell better by itself. I don't think too many of the US box version made their way to Europe and most DKs were sold in CBS style boxes.... of which there were a couple variations. The USA box existed before the ADAM was released (pictured in Arnold Greenberg's hand with the Purple Proto CV box), but most likely wasn't a big seller because it was the pack-in game with the CV and most ADAM owners bought the Super Game version that was released on data pack in early 1984.
Great review TPR !! It really showed off a lot of the great features Gerry put in with all of his hard work!
It was a real pleasure giving Gerry feedback while he was developing, he is such a receptive developer and I think his openness and creativity only made an average arcade game, into an amazing home version!
Your red box of Mario-themed controllers is still intact. Lucky you, mine was completely destroyed by "unfortunate storage conditions".
Yep. I had it very carefully packed in a box in our garage and let's just say that one thing fell on top of another and that carefully packed box was knocked over and crushed. It was the ONLY thing that suffered and the controller itself is still fine, but the actual box was just not strong enough. I actually think it is the only "lost" item I've had in my entire collecting career so far. That was not a good day...
I had gotten rid of my modest Colecovision collection because I was tired of dealing with the flakey hardware, power switch issues, etc. The Collectorvision though has me wanting to jump back in. That thing looks and sounds incredible.
All it takes is proper maintenance / refurbishment and the power switch will be good for another decade, if not more, depending on use.
Yeah I think out of the 3 or 4 systems I use on a regular basis they have all been rock solid. If I ever encounter a system that has power switch issues, I'll open it up, spray that area with a little bit of Deoxit and it's good to go. I think it takes me about 10 minutes to fix.
Wow nice collection, couldn't read the entire thread but so many great pictures in here, thanks for sharing.
Mike Jones was protected from evil by the Southern Cross in StarTropics - would it protect me from the Sony Playstation?
I began my journey here, at the central railstation in Tokyo. Since I'm not rich enough to take the shinkansen bullet train (why do you think I'm collecting old games), I took the night bus to Kobe which costs about 8500 yen one way. I left at about 11 pm and arrived at 7 in the morning. The bus was actually more spacious than the JAL flight I originally took to Tokyo, but I couldn't sleep anyway - I was too busy reading the strategy guide for Xevious I found the day before.
I was a little worried about my chances of finding things in Kobe, although that wasn't the main point of going there (or so I said to myself). The 1994 earthquake may have meant that all the city's Famicom stock was lost, or something... As it turned out I had very little to worry about.
This project began as an exploration into my mother's past and her upbringing in the small town of Sincelejo, Colombia. My mother has been slowly and sporadically writing a memoir about her childhood in this small town and in it she recounts the reasons why she decided to leave and never go back. Even though I was born and raised in Bogota, Colombia just a plane ride away from Sincelejo, I've always been estranged and separated from this place and my mother's family. After reading her manuscript a couple of years ago I felt strangely connected to the town, the stories and the people she writes about. I realized there was an entire side of my mother that I barely knew, so I decided to go back and reconnect with that side of my roots.
I left Colombia when I was 18 years ago and I've been living in Brooklyn, NY for almost a decade. With time, I've come to realize that deciding to go back and dive into my mother's past has been a quest for my own identity and a search for my home country of Colombia.

Barcelona’s culinary scene runs the gamut from tapas to Thai food, and its legendary nightlife necessitates sustaining bar snacks to keep the party alive until the wee hours. Enter the bikini. Named for a concert hall in Les Corts, this seductive take on ham and cheese tips its hat to France’s Croque Monsieur but is an utterly Catalan affair. We found a pretty good one here.
There’s a Betty and Veronica situation between Spain’s two biggest cities. Capital Madrid claims its major corporations, some of Western Europe’s best art museums and an almost Italian devotion to traditional ingredients, simply and honorably prepared.
Sexy coastal sibling Barcelona has wild Gaudí architecture, nightlife to make Dina Lohan weep, eight miles of Mediterranean coastline and several of the world’s most influential and inventive chefs. Add in a few decades of 20th Century separatism, and a little city-to-city opposition is pretty much inevitable.
For all its regional differences, what unifies modern-day Spain is a national devotion to bar snacks. From Sevillan paella to Navarre’s now ubiquitous tortilla Española, Spain’s local bites are timeless, tasty and proudly defended against regional competition.
In snacking, unlike soccer, the advantage is clearly Catalonian. Barcelona’s culinary scene runs the gamut from tapas to Thai food, and its legendary nightlife necessitates sustaining bar snacks to keep the party alive until the wee hours.
Enter the bikini. Named for a concert hall in Les Corts, this seductive take on ham and cheese tips its hat to France’s Croque Monsieur but is an utterly Catalan affair. (A Madrilleño version goes by the decidedly less suggestive moniker el combinado.)
At Eixample tapas bar Tapaç 24, el Bulli alum Carles Abellán elevates the simple sandwich, using grated black truffles alongside local jamon iberico and queso Manchego on grilled, crustless white bread. Sliced into four delicate triangles, the result is a satisfying, sexy little bite that packs a lot of punch for a mere €8 (about $10) per plate.

My friend came up to me two days ago (March 25) and said that it was me that converted her to atheism. I showed her a couple of books, websites, and some of my favorites on youtube about a month ago, when she asked me about Atheism. I didn't really intend to convert her purposely, we were just casually yapping in my house about nothing and the subject came up. She thanked me too! This is the first person I ever converted!
Well, I don't have a great story but after 42 years of marriage my husband seems to agree with me (in matters of religion)!

Little by little I guess our discussions have gotten to him and he sees the logic of it all now. Now I can finally share my beliefs with someone who understands! And it only took me about 40 years! Now we can discuss how we can't believe how people can believe what they do and pray for this and that and thank god when their neighbor dies in a tornado, flood, etc. because they are spared. I only wish I realized there were so many of us out there much sooner and I wish I could meet other people who share my beliefs. That said, I'm happy enough to have the internet and most importantly, my husband!
Actually, I don't think it is possible to convert anyone to atheism. I think what happens is that when information is made available to people in whom childhood indoctrination was only mild and who have a certain open-mindedness they arrive at atheism themselves. It would be folly to hand a fundamentalist christian (for example) a book by Harris, Dennet or Hitchens and expect a 'conversion'. Even if a heavily indoctrinated person were to read such a book their minds would be closed to the arguments therein regardless of their logical coherence. That's what 'faith' does. Faith means not wanting to know what is true - Neitsche.
I may give someone information that I know, experiences that I value, relate quotes or data from another, but I don't think I have the power to CONVERT someone to atheism. I'm not even sure that I WANT that ability. After all, no one converted me. I came to the conclusion that there are no gods ON MY OWN.
I hope that those who have questions, who doubt, and who are curious about how the world really work are brave enough to dig, to research, and to simply ask.
Yes, indeed. When they can see the facts, think, they convert themselves. Your seeds give them something with which to work.
When my husband and I both came out as Atheists, my brother in law was still Theist and responded defending his faith. When we talked, we talked mostly about science and we showed him some Neil DeGrasse Tyson and other related videos and he loved them. I don't think it was us that deconverted him, but the fact that he takes time to understand and learn and that did it for him.
The road to atheism is a long, lonely & stony one. About all I have been able to accomplish is to remove some of the 'stones' in people's paths.

Turning now to your interest in the psychology of enlightenment, let me say I once had a peak experience during my first meditation session with TM years ago.
I was doing what they had told me to do, just tending to business, when all of a sudden it was as if I were catapulted into an Expanse, like an infinite hall but with no walls and with no sense of time passing, a Place with tremendous energy or enlivement, yet a sense of stillness, order, and peace.
I felt wonderment, amazement, okayness. The experience, certainly in those years I thought had to be one of Eternity, couldn't have lasted for more than one microsecond! This was MY "natural wonder" of my lifetime. It was rare, and no one I know has ever experienced anything like it.
That's why for years I said it was an occurrence of God, not knowing what else to say about it or what to ascribe it to. So I guess the God word has been used by the ignorant to name any remaining things that appear to defy ready explanation using terms we already know.
Your interest in counseling and history as a single father interested me. If you're still saying Hello to people, I'd love to hear back from you!

BTW #1, that date is when Mr. Pai plans to have the FCC vote on undoing the net neutrality rules set up a couple of years ago.
BTW #2, you wasted electrons or postage if you complained or expressed your views to the FCC. They now claim there were so many that they didn't have time to look at them. They basically ignored “thousands of consumer complaints and millions of individual comments that ask the FCC to save net neutrality and uphold the principles that all traffic should be created equal.”

The benefits of having a telecommuting job are immense. Imagine having an extra hour in the morning and evening because you don't have any drive time. Imagine not having to spend as much time or money on the clothes required to work in a professional office.
Telecommuting is a wonderful option for anyone who would prefer working at home to working in an employer's office. The benefits of having a telecommuting job are immense especially for parents who want to be at home with young children. Imagine having an extra hour in the morning and evening to spend with your family because you don't have any drive time.
Also imagine not having to spend as much time or money on the clothes required to work in a professional office. Granted, you may have to go to an occasional outside meeting every once in a while, but for the most part, it'll just be you and your computer and the computer doesn't care what you wear.
Finding a telecommuting job isn't always easy but for the well-skilled job seeker, there are many jobs to be found. Tenacity and patience are the attributes you will need to make your way through the maze of finding the job you're seeking. Below is outlined one resource - Craigslist - that you can use when you start your search for a telecommuting job. This is not the only resource available to you, it's just one of many, but it's a good place to start. The jobs are there, you just need to find them.
Craigslist is a national classified ad website where a lot of great jobs get posted, including those looking for work at home telecommuters. The website is free to read and it's free to post as well. It's become a very popular place to find jobs that are available. This article will explain how to find the telecommuting jobs that are advertised.
To find telecommuting jobs, first go to Craigslist. Click on any city in the right-hand column, and then choose a job type in the column to the left of the city column. It doesn't matter what type of job category you choose, we're going to change that choice anyway.
You will need to click into each job separately to determine if it is a legitimate job posting or not. Often you will also find regular jobs posted as telecommuting jobs, so read the postings carefully. Watch out for the postings that offer more money than what you know to be a normal pay range for the job you're seeking, they are probably scams.
Also, be careful about going to interviews, if it's not in an office building where other people are around, like at someone's house, either pass on the offer or explain to the interviewer that with internet fraud as bad as it is, you would feel more comfortable meeting in a public place like a restaurant or a coffee house.
CraigsList doesn't offer a feature to search the entire country and it's a shame because it makes this type of research very time consuming having to check each city individually. It may be easier for you to set a "Favorites" folder with all the searches so you can get to each city quickly. You should consider checking every major city since telecommuting can be done from anywhere in the country.
It doesn't matter if you're in a tiny town in Texas and the company is located in New York City or Los Angeles. Just be sure to watch the ad to be sure it doesn't request you to be local to the employer, some require periodic meetings in their office. And lastly, be sure to only apply to the most recent entries as these jobs go quickly, no need to waste your time applying for a job that's already filled.
Good luck with your job search. A little hard work along with some patience while seeking out the jobs should help you to be employed in no time.

As experienced litigation attorneys, we know that litigation should be the last option for resolving a conflict. Several alternatives exist, including negotiation, mediation and collaboration.
In a traditional negotiation, each party strives to reach an agreement out of court. The negotiation may take place through conference calls, the exchange of letters or a settlement conference. Negotiation often involves as much advocacy and strategy as litigation but empowers the parties to craft the settlement that best serves their needs.
Mediation is a process guided by a neutral third party who is trained in conflict resolution and usually is familiar with the subject matter of the conflict. While mediators often are lawyers, it is not a requirement. The parties may have legal representation during the mediation or they may choose not to include their attorneys until an agreement is ready to be drafted or reviewed.
The collaborative process is a method of alternative dispute resolution that was developed from the mediation model and has exploded in the family law area. In a collaborative case, the clients determine their own resolution with the support of a team of trained professionals. The team of professionals may include attorneys, mental health professionals and/or a financial professional. The goals of the professionals are to make sure the clients are fully informed, learn how to communicate with each other successfully and are emotionally prepared to engage in the collaborative process. In order to achieve these goals, the parties must commit to resolve their matter through collaboration without resorting to litigation and waive all confidentiality. The collaborative process is distinguished by its transparency and respect for the parties.

Hi, friends! I’m finally back on the blog today to share this Pineapple Sunshine Cake with you! ……..on the first day of fall. ? Originally this post was supposed to go up in August, but some rescheduling happened and here we are!
I am 100% obsessed with fall. It’s the greatest season and the absolute best time of the year. Sure spring and summer are nice, but fall is where it’s at. It’s cozy, if you live in the South you finally get to stop sweating (plus there’s football), it has the cutest clothes, and it has the best flavors for baking!
But! I know not all of us are fall fanatics, so I figured those of you still clinging to summer (let’s be real, it’s still 80+ degrees here in the South) will enjoy this pineapple cake!
I’m excited to be partnering up with Miss Jones Bakes to bring you this recipe today! And A GIVEAWAY. Yes! If you have never tried these organic baking mixes before, you now have the opportunity to win a Cake in a Box Kit!
To give you a little info on Miss Jones Bakes if you’ve never heard of them, they make organic cake mixes, cookie mixes, and frostings. In the past I’ve always tended to stay away from boxed cake mixes in favor of from-scratch recipes because they’re fresher and I know what ingredients I’m putting in my cake. Like canned frosting is seriously one of the grossest things to me these days. The texture is always weird and off.
But if I need a box mix, these are my new go-to! All of their mixes are organic, non-GMO, and plant-based, so you don’t have to worry about all that stuff that usually comes with prepackaged items and products livin’ that shelf life. And I was seriously eating the chocolate frosting out of the can with a spoon! It somehow tasted EXACTLY LIKE A BROWNIE.
They’ve also gotten the seal of approval from Snoop Dog and Martha Stewart. These are the things that matter, friends.
So! This cake is super easy. I’m not even going to fool with posting a real recipe because the mix does all the work!
Prepare cake mix according to package directions, folding in crushed pineapple. Divide batter among cake pans and bake according to package directions, or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cakes cool in pans for 5-10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Once cakes are cool, frost with vanilla frosting. Place the top of the pineapple in the center of the cake and press down slightly to make sure it sticks in the frosting. (Remove to slice cake.)
If you’re looking for something to do with the rest of the pineapple, I used mine to make dried pineapple flowers for a different recipe. But you could always just peel it, dice it, and save it for eating. Or you could crush up some pineapple yourself in place of the crushed pineapple in the recipe.
Access to Tips for Doulas is available for just $30! You can checkout via paypal or use your credit card here:
This website was created the week I began my doula certification (April 2011) and quickly became filled with all my thoughts as I went through training - book reports, my experience with seeking out mentors, sharing my mentors' brilliant tips and insights, offering up my mistakes and successes to help others learn! It was a wonderful opportunity for me personally and professionally to chronicle the months of my doula certification, then birth photographer training, becoming a midwife assistant and childbirth educator, and so much more in the years since! I've been blessed to attend 100 births in the last few years and teach over 200 couples through the childbirth class - it's been humbling and enlightening.
As I began receiving increasing amounts of feedback and website visitors I realized I needed to go back and update and revise many of my posts. I was shocked to see I had created over 100 posts specifically under my category "Tips for Doulas!" Knowing it would take a lot of time to work my way through it, and hearing that the information I was providing was so valuable, I made the decision to do things a bit differently going forward. All the information is still here - ideas on everything from supporting a mom with an epidural, peanut ball use, photo tips for doulas, to suggestions on what to wear to births and thank you gift ideas for the medical care team. It's a LOT of information whether you are a new doula or an experienced doula wanting some fresh ideas on further building your business. Instead of having everything lumped together in my main site for clients I've separated out the doula/birth professional posts. They're now privately accessible with a log in and password and I'm offering all this great information for a small fee.
One of my PDFs ("Things to Consider") in the Forms section was also receiving a lot of traffic and many requests from doulas asking if they could use it. That file is being updated and will be available only as part of my Tips for Doulas package.
All this is available for just $30. Seriously, it's over 100 posts - you could read one a week and it would take you two years to get through all these tips. If you find that the tips are not what you are looking for then let me know within the first thirty days and your account can be cancelled and fee refunded. (Because of the nature of this program, a refund will not be given if you've had access for more than 30 days.)
Curious if it's worth it? You can read some of the testimonials I've received on the posts so far. Here's just one of the sweet messages:
I just want to thank you for all the time and effort you have put into this site. I just recently decided to become a Doula myself and have been struggling to find helpful advice online. I found your site this morning and have been pouring over it all day long. You answered so many of the questions I have had and helped me think of new ones and I have already learned so much. Thank you again! I look forward to following your story and learning more. – Mandy
*Some of my posts for doulas I will always keep public, as I feel the information is crucial for all of us to know when supporting moms. Those include my article on supporting clients with a history of trauma and everything related to postpartum depression.*
Once your payment through PayPal is completed please wait, as the page will take a few seconds to redirect you to this site to set up a log-in and password. The log-in page is also to the right under "For Doulas" or you can click here. Once you've logged in then anytime you come back to this page you'll be able to see the Tips for Doula posts.
If you do NOT have a PayPal account and want to use a credit or debit card be sure to click on the little link below the login space on Payal, as it's still on through their page - we circled it here to show you:
Debbe, if you click on the PayPal button above it will take you through the payment and registration process where you’ll set up a username and password. Then all the Tips for Doulas posts will be visible after you login!
I am a birth doula trainer with DONA and have a new online doula training program as well as being a midwife. I was thinking it would be great to add your Doula Tips to my website resources and link to you – do you have any promotions? Im thinking a really short video about what you offer and how a new doula can access your support.
Jessica, that’s a great idea! I’ll have to talk with my tech/video guy and see what we can come up with – thanks for the suggestion. 🙂
Yes – if you are on Facebook then check out this group, Love What You Doula. It’s created and moderated by a doula I know, admire, and love and it’s a fantastic community. I hope that helps! 🙂
New posts were written up consistently through the end of 2016, and there will be new (but less frequent) posts continuing in 2017. Please let me know if you have any other questions!
Best Doula Training is what I would suggest. Maria & Amanda are the creators and instructors, they previously ran the Birth Boot Camp doula training but they have just this year set up under the Best Doula Training name and they are truly fantastic. I’ve seen their materials and talked at length with Maria about the program, what they teach, the on-going support, and followed up with doulas they trained to see what they thought as well. It’s a really, really in depth and professional program that will get your business off on the right foot and make you feel confident walking into the labor room. (And I’m not in any way rewarded for referring to them, I just know Maria well and know what’s gone into creating this and I believe in it!) 🙂

As a parent, you definitely want to give the best education for your children and to make sure that they can achieve their dreams in the future. To give our kids the best education, the first thing we need to do is to find a good school for them. At this point, you might feel confused whether you should send your kids to public or private school. Both have their own plus and minus points. But when it comes to a school with great academic performance and environment, there are some strong aspects and benefits that make private schools become a better choice. Here are some of them.
One of the best things about private school is definitely the number of students in a class. Private school in Denver generally has 10 to 15 students in each class. Some even has less than ten. This is a very different condition with public schools which mostly have more than 20 students in a class. The small number of students will make a better learning environment. First of all, it can make the students concentrate better while studying.
But most importantly, lower teacher to student ratio will allow the teacher to pay better attention to every kid in the class. This way, the teacher can easily find out if a student doesn’t perform well in certain subject, or when a student is experiencing some problem and then take appropriate action to help them.
We know that school life is not always what we learn inside the class. There are also so many things to learn outside the class and that is why extracurricular activity is important. Public schools also have extracurricular activities. However, since private schools have the resources to allocate bigger budgets to those activities, the facilities, programs and instructors are way better. This way, extracurricular activity is not only a way to make friends or to spend time after school, but also really improve the skill of the students.
Unlike public schools, private schools have certain philosophy as well as aspect or subject they are focused on. It means, you can choose the school that share the same philosophy with you and make sure that your children will grow up in an environment you can trust. For example, you can choose private school according to your specific religious belief. Furthermore, if you already know what talent your kids have, you can choose a private school that focuses on that specific subject to help improving your children’s skills.
Last but not least, it is not a secret that private school has stronger academic program compared to most public schools. Don’t get this wrong. Both public and private school have the same academic curriculum. But private school has programs that teach the student a lot more things than just the standard curriculum. Private schools often have programs to help the students preparing themselves for important tests and this is why private school students often have better academic performance.
Every business owner knows all about how important marketing is to their business. Perhaps they know this, but many business owners don’t know how to market correctly to make it effective.
Use a method to reach your particular market and that is copywriting. Words speak to people if directed properly. The customers need to ensure what you are offering is exactly what they need.
Learn to change your list of services into ways to personally benefit the client. The customers want to know what’s in it for them. If you listed same day service on your feature list then don’t just write that in your copywriting explain how same day service means no waiting queues, the benefits of having the product or service completed that day brag about what the actual feature in this case same day service actually means.
Offer some sort of proof, again this can be done via copywriting with personal testimonials from users who have tried the product or service. Reviews are best explained in detail so if your selling a hair product a feedback review saying it was a good product I will buy again is lame and unattractive. This pitch sounds like someone was paid a few dollars to write it.
You want a review that states how it work on the hair, how it made the hair feel, how long did it take, how long did it last etc. These are what people want to know from other experiences. When writing about how your business is better than the rest explain why.
Write an easy to read few sentences as to why you are better is it the quality of service you provide if so then elaborate. One mistake a lot of business owners tend to do when writing up their information they say everyone is the perfect customer, or this will suit everyone.
Frankly no it wont suit everyone if it is a lawn mowing service it isn’t ideal for someone living in a nursing home or a pregnancy fitness routine will certainly not sit a middle age tradesman.
Write who will benefit specially this will approach the potential customers like they are being spoken to and cared about individually. People do not like being someone who was explicitly sold to.
Use your copywriting words to disguise the fact you are trying to sell the consumer something using a formula like 80% good, enticing information then add a quick short 20% of actual selling the product in there.
We all get sick of those same old sales pitch that all sound the same you want a pitch that’s unique to your product that is for a certain type of person. A huge line of skills isn’t needed to use copywriting to improve your business. Most times it’s just speaking from the heart instead of trying to add all these chunks of important and complicated words and bundles of paragraphs people can’t be bothered to read.
Use your words wisely, relevantly calmly and there’s your successful business copywriting right there!
Well, my Pinterest Challenge piece was SUPPOSED to go up yesterday afternoon. I was putting the final touches on it as my husband and son wrestled in a nearby room when I heard a scream. Not TOO unusual and I usually don't worry... until I heard my husband's reaction.
Uh oh, he said. And we spent the rest of the day in the Emergency Room. Charming nurses and entertaining patients. More details to come later this week on the blog. Important thing is - everyone is ok.
So forgive me for being a day late in posting my project. Hopefully you were able to check out all the other Pinhead's projects as well as our Guest Pinhead amazing wall art using Christmas lights and canvas. Beautiful.
For this round of the Challenge, I wanted to involve my children. It was a particularly cranky day and I was in desperate need of a fun, cool, TIME CONSUMING activity that would be quick to make. I remembered pinning something called "Moon Sand" awhile back that had two simple ingredients. Flour and Baby Oil.
The ingredients were simple: 4 cups of flour and 1/2 baby oil. Mixed together to create this amazingly smooth play-dough like substance that held it's shape easily {and smelled like a fresh, clean baby}.
I tried to mix food coloring in with it - to no avail. Don't try it. But the kids had fun anyway - especially when I introduced the straws.
It was a blissful 25 minutes of entertainment for the kids {with only minor quarrels} and a great photo-op for me! {Sometimes, when we are having a bad day, I just pull the camera out and hide behind the lens. It seriously helps.}
Don't forget to link up any of your Pinterest inspired projects! You have until Sunday at midnight. The winner will be announced on Tuesday! Check out the Pinterest Challenge blog to see the prize package!
This is one of my biggest fears when I hear my husband rolling around in the floor with my 3 year old. Yikes! I'm so glad everyone is okay!
Hi Carla. I just used 1/2 cup. If that doesn't seem enough to you, you could add a little more at a time. After mixing for awhile, though - it really seemed to soak it all up without being too greasy. Hope that helps!
Hi! I'm Rebecca. I'm so glad you are here! To say that I sew and sell bags is simply not the entire truth. I sew and sell bags with the intention and desire that each bag would make lives better. Not the lives of my customer (although I do hope you LOVE your bag), but the lives of those who could never afford a Better Life Bag. Profits from all sales go to help those in need. Stick around, follow my crazy life, and get a taste of how rewarding it can be to give back. Read more here.
As one of the internet’s leading resources on scientific matters, it is my occasional duty to update you on what the scientific community is up to. And by “what the scientific community is up to,” I mean haphazardly written articles that through either ignorance or malice misinterpret the findings of studies to create the most sensationalist headline possible.
According to a new study from Yale University and the University of California at San Diego, good friends are often genetically similar, and can share as much as 1% of the same gene variants. In genetic terms, that’s a lot. As close as, say, fourth cousins.
This of course raises the question of “so, like can I have sex with my friend without having a weird genetically-deficient baby?” No, that’s not the question this raises? Okay, I’ll move on. Just keep in mind you and your bestie are watching Clueless for the fifteenth time and saying all the lines together that it was genetically predestined and free will is an illusion.
For the new study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Kesselheim and his colleagues analyzed data on more than 11,000 people who were prescribed common medications including beta blockers, statins and ACE inhibitors after a heart attack.
Over the following year, almost a third had a change in pill color or shape. Those patients were between 30 and 70 percent more likely to stop taking their medication than patients whose pills stayed the same.
First of all, nobody has ever said the word “annals” without immediately following with “of history” so I’m skeptical of this thing off the bat. Second of all, “between 30 and 70%” is quite the window there. Third of all, while I’m kinda with the skeptical people who are good with their heart exploding, isn’t being wary of this sort of change normal? I’m just saying! Maybe the pharmacist filled out the prescription wrong. This guy got blinded! In any case, what should we do in this sort of situation, doctor guy?

Ever since I heard of sock boots, I was curious and wanted to check them out for myself. I had a pair of knee sock boots a while ago in India, but since I don’t have them with me anymore, I thought it was the right time to invest in a new pair. I knew just the place to look for them. Here in Poland, there are a lot of fast fashion stores and it is easy to keep changing and buying new stuff every season. I am not saying that I do that, in fact, it’s been a couple of months since I purchased any new item of clothing. I was even not intending to buy anything till up until Christmas, but then I scrolled on the online shoe website and when I saw these sock boots, I knew they would be amazing.
The shoes are from an online store which is extremely popular in Poland called Deezee.pl. Prior to this, I never thought it would be possible for me to order shoes online and let alone be satisfied. But ever since my first purchase back in 2013, I have been hooked. Even though I have plenty of shoes now, I always find myself browsing their website every now and then, just to look at the beautiful shoes. I LOVE them! Shopping online on Deezee.pl is very easy and they offer over a 1000 pairs of shoes in different categories and styles. As long as you know your shoe size, it is very convenient to order. On the rare occasion that a shoe was slightly bigger for me, I just had to return them via post and I got a full refund for the amount. The customer care services are off the charts. If you are looking for trendy shoes at affordable prices then I would definitely recommend this store.
I wanted to take these booties our for a spin and I wanted to take a couple of pictures for this post with some nature in the background. After driving around a bit, brainstorming for a good place with some trees as a backdrop, we arrived at the Las Wolski forest area, close to the Krakow Zoo. It was quite nice to go up the trails beside the path that leads up to the zoo. There were not many people around and we came across a few locals walking their dogs. The atmosphere was peaceful and very quiet and we could only hear some birds in the distance upon the trees. Of course, I had a backup pair of shoes as it was after the rains and most of the forest floor littered with soggy leaves. When we found the perfect spot I whipped out my shoes and put them on. We took a couple of shots and then walked around for a while. We took these pictures with our new Canon camera, which I must admit I need to start learning how to operate.
Hope you enjoy the pictures as I love the way they turned out! It’s completely different to what I have done before 🙂
Are these shoes easy to walk in them? Because I’m kind of, well not kind of , I am clumsy when it comes to heels!
I LOVE those boots. They look gorgeous on you. That is a great look and I love the scenery, They are so Christmasy.
I have a pair myself; aren’t they the most comfortable? Not to mention, I just love the look of velvet. Mine are in black but I like yours in red. They just pop in your photos and look so festive for this holiday season. In fact, even after the holidays, I think they will look fantastuc as well!
Your boots look awesome and will look great in winters! And this picture has such a beautiful Christmassy feel to it!!!
Wow these look so good on you, especially with that outfit! Thanks for the great review, now I want to go and get some of my own!
I love your boots, they are very cute! I love the outfit that you paired them with as well. The outfit definitely works for you. I need to get me a pair of those boots!

As a strong follow-up to “It’s Here Tonight,” Brooklyn’s Mars Motel dropped “Living In The Moment.” Vocalist Sarik Kumar explains, "It’s a song about youth and independence, and the lyrics touch upon the time when one leaves home and goes out into the world. But upon returning, the place you once remembered and loved so much somehow feels different and unfamiliar."
The members of Mars Motel are Sarik Kumar (Vox & Guitar), Wesley Wynne (Guitar), Jordan Lipp (Drums) & Justin Lieberthal (Bass), Mars Motel's future single releases are slated to release throughout the year, with a follow up live EP in the works.
We bought some old family land which has a 1936 old original logs which are in most part good shape. The outside is the problem, there is some chinking gone but the logs have been sprayed black with white chinking 2-3" gaps between logs. We are considering putting vinyl over it and adding onto the house to save money. Any ideas if we could strip the black and put back an original log/red color and what cost could run us. Everyone hates for us to see our heritage go to vinyl siding, but really do

Paul Fierlinger, animator, director and producer, is a true classic of global animation, whose career and life span between the USA and Europe, primarily the Czech Republic, where he began his artistic explorations. Innovative in terms of animation techniques, he also embraced the developments in computer technology, but remained seemingly inclined to simple, always impressive solutions. In his most prominent works he often focused on documentary and autobiographic animations, occasionally adding a touch of political commentary, which is why some of his films have made great success at documentary film festivals, testifying to the outstanding power of animation in the field of non-fiction. A large portion of his oeuvre raises the custom-made, commissioned film to the highest level of creativity.
He accomplished very successful collaborations with Sandra Fierlinger and other distinguished visual artists. His animations It’s So Nice to Have a Wolf around the House, And Then I’ll Stop, My Dog Tulip, Drawn from Memory, Still Life with Animated Dogs and Me… Jane, which garnered awards in Zagreb and at other animation festivals, set the standards of poeticism and plausibility in animated worlds, imbued with intelligent observations about people, dogs, nature and the world, drenched in heart-warming, idiosyncratic humour.
Paul Fierlinger will receive Animafest’s Lifetime Achievement Award in person at the official opening ceremony of the 28th World Festival of Animated Film on 4 June 2018, at Europa Cinema, and the festival will host a retrospective programme dedicated to his films and a talk about his work.

There are few landscape architecture firms today that can say Urban Agriculture Design is on their shortlist of services offered. Most firms are capable of designing a productive space, of course, whether or not they can say they specialize in this area of design is another matter. Below are eight North American Landscape Architecture firms that are leading the way through their own advocacy and stellar Urban Agriculture projects.
Located on Canada's west coast, this landscape architecture firm concentrates on sustainability, focusing on ways to design the "ecologically resilient, and prosperous communities" of tomorrow. HB Lanarc also has several specialties. one of course including urban agriculture. Their focus is a little more broad however, "Sustainable Food Systems & Agricultural Urbanism," is the technical service provided. Designing urban farms is only one aspect of their speciality, they also provide policy, planning, and guidelines for food systems in cities.
In my first installment of the UA series, I listed the Top 4 Urban Agriculture Books. including Agricultural Urbanism. The author, Janine de la Salle, is the Planner and Food Agricultural Systems Specialist. She not only provides designs, but also works with municipalities to develop food strategies and policy, and shares her knowledge through lectures and workshops on urban agriculture.
In their portfolio is a project called 'False Creek Urban Agriculture Design Guidelines '. This project works on fitting productive landscapes into residential landscapes, and how food in the community can help redesign and rebuild a neighbourhood's social and sustainable outlook.
At the offices of EOA (Elmslie Osler Architecture) there is a division called Grow Studio. which specializes in urban agriculture. Like the other firms mentioned in my list, Grow Studio brings added value to EOA and visa-versa, as they focus on integrating food systems into the "existing commercial, residential, and community and ivic parks." EOA also specializes in architectural branding, so rest a sure that any urban agriculture project will be distinctive.
One cool project that is still in the works is called The Urban Farming Food Chain. It is a series of vertical growing spaces in the city, which create a continuous harvest of fruits and veggies. They also plan on adding a classroom and kitchen facilities in phase 4.
Bill Eubanks, the Creative Director for Urban Edge Studio (UES), recently spoke at LaBASH 2013 (a student run conference for students in landscape architecture) about designing urban agriculture. UES specializes in urban walkability, streetscapes, plazas and parks and pretty much anything else to do with the 'urban-scape,' and it just so happens that all their design beliefs support urban agriculture as well.
UES has done multiple urban agricultural projects, but one in particular, called the Medical University of South Carolina's Urban Farm (MUSC), they worked on in collaboration with Crop Up . The landscape architectural and urban design skills of UES matched with Crop Up's educational, inspirational, and planning background, made MUSC Farm a successful design. MUSC Urban Farm stands by the university's mission to attain healthy lifestyles
and to educate people, by adding classrooms, workshops, and food production and educational opportunities.
Crop Up is a consulting firm that specializes in creating "food projects in urban areas." Founder Elizabeth Peak's expertise and experience in permaculture and food education gives her the perfect edge in completing urban agriculture projects.
April Philips Design Works (APDW) focuses on places for people to escape and enjoy. The firm also specializes on the sustainability aspect of projects. Lead by April Philips. author of Designing Urban Agriculture. APDW offers the regular services of any successful landscape architecture firm, plus something special: urban agricultural landscapes and green roof design. Her credibility, expertise, and knowledge, give this firm an agricultural advantage.
APDW in conjunction with Miller Creek Middle School created the Miller Creek Edible Garden - a kid friendly, food focused, learning sanctuary right on the school grounds. The design focuses on experiential and hands on learning.
Kenneth Weikal Landscape Architecture is a well know landscape architecture firm, specializing in sustainability, horticulture, master planning, etc. and now, productive landscapes. The firm designed the famous Lafayette Greens Urban Garden in Lafayette, Detroit. This garden is in the heart of an under-utilized and forgotten section of downtown Detroit. Now the farm has revitalized the area and has allowed people to gain a sense of community and have a place to learn and interact with one another. Landscape Architecture Magazine (LAM) recently did an article on the farm in their April issue.
Nelson Byrd Woltz. the classic and quite recognizable landscape architecture firm (the one that designed one of my favourite public parks - City Garden ), now does food landscapes. NBW recently just came out with a book called Garden, Park, Community, Farm which shows off selected works. The firm designed the Urban Farm of Charlottesville in a low income area with hopes to create a sense of community, access to fresh food, and to help educate the citizens about nutrition.
" Landscapes are the physical manifestations of our values," is this firms design philosophy. BASE Landscape wants to recreate what we as humans value the most, and they sure know that this is to sustain ourselves (or in other words. food). A fun and collaborative studio, BASE specializes in 'foodscapes' and a quick look at their portfolio will show you some of the groundbreaking projects they have been working on.
Once a former parking lot, the Bronx Roofpark is five acres of rooftop farm and playground - the ultimate oasis for food education with outdoor kitchens, recreational activities and play spaces to inspire New York City's youth.

This past Thursday, the Braves made their first trade of the season, acquiring LHP Jonny Venters from the Tampa Bay Rays for international pool money. This isn’t just big to help the struggling Braves bullpen, but it is big when you hear the story of Jonny Venters.
Jonny Venters was drafted out of high school in the 30th round in the 2003 MLB draft, and he didn’t make his MLB debut until 2010. Jonny played until 2012, which included one all-star game in 2011. He then was having problems with his left elbow, and had to receive tommy john surgery which left him out for the entire 2013 season.
At the beginning of the 2014 season, he received the news that he, once again, tore his ulnar collateral ligament. He then had to receive his third tommy john surgery. The two surgeries forced him to miss the 2013-2015 seasons with his elbow problems.
Most people didn’t believe he would have a career after this.However, he was assigned to rehab by the Braves, but was released 2 days later.
In 2015, the Tampa Bay Rays signed Venters 2 a 2-year minor league contract. It took until 2018 when he got to hit the MLB mound again. As he made his first appearance after surgery on April 25th, 2018. He made 22 appearances while compiling a 3.86 ERA before he got the news he was being traded to the Atlanta Braves.
He was happy to receive this news. His family, kids, and everyone he loved lived in Atlanta, so he would be able to see them more often and hang out with them more.
“To be able to come back to where it all started for me and be in this thick of a playoff race,” Venters said. “It feels like I never left.”
So far, Venters has pitched well in 2 appearances for the braves, but we will see what he can do to help this struggling bullpen
We are trying to create an ultimate fan base for Atlanta sports fans to show their passion and their talent. Our definition of talent is if you can make videos, create and/or sell merchandise, design, write, and anything else you can do to show your talent by showing our fan base what you can do!

PHILADELPHIA, PENN. / ORANGE, Calif. (Oct. 1, 2018) – Promising featherweight prospect Ruben Villa (13-0, 5 KOs) headlines a talent rich card from his hometown of Salinas, Calif. on Saturday, Oct. 13.
Villa last fought from the Salinas Storm House in April, when he routed fellow prospect Marlon Olea in route to winning the vacant WBO Youth featherweight championship. It was Villa’s first title since turning professional in July 2016.
The two-time national Golden Gloves winner fights for the fifth time this year after registering six wins in 2017.
“It’s incredible how fast I’ve developed,” said Villa, who is managed by Danny Zamora and trained by Max Garcia. “It feels like it was yesterday that I was in four round fights and now I’m routinely headlining shows.”
The lefty, who sometimes conducts training camps in the sparring rich city of Riverside, Calif., decided to stay close to home for this fight. Him and his team have zeroed in on what is required to defeat Carrizoza.
“He fought my stablemate, Michael Dutchover [undefeated junior lightweight], last year so Mike gave me a pretty detailed scouting report on him,” Villa said. “He’s a bruiser. He likes to come forward and get you onto the ropes or just backpedaling. I know how to fight guys like that. I’ve fought against guys like that before and I’ve seen a bunch of them in previous training camps. We are really comfortable in our game plan.”

Unlike other forms of Glutathione, Acetyl-Glutathione tablets are odor-free and easy to take. Glutathione is found throughout the body, and is concentrated in the liver and kidneys, as well as the lining of the lungs and intestines. It is the body’s major endogenous antioxidant, playing a central role in maintaining the redox state of every cell in the body. Besides directly reacting with oxidants, it also recycles other antioxidants back to their reduced forms, both endogenous antioxidants such as Glutaredoxins, and exogenous antioxidants including Vitamins C and E. It serves as a co-factor for Glutathione Peroxidases, and is involved in the regulation of the Nitric Oxide cycle. Glutathione is important in liver andkidney detoxification processes, and Glutathione levels are considered a key marker of immune status."*
Because Glutathione is a tripeptide (i.e., made of three amino acids), oral reduced Glutathione has unfavorable biochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. It is not well absorbed from the gut, it has a short half-life in blood plasma, and it is not clear that it is transported into cells to any significant extent. When taken orally, the body must break most of the Glutathione into its component amino acids (cysteine, Glutamate, Glycine) to allow absorption into the blood stream. Even if some whole Glutathione does gain access to the blood stream, in order to be taken up by cells, it must be broken down and re-synthesized to Glutathione intracellularly. Metabolic and enzymatic obstacles in the body can and do impair these processes.
S-Acetyl-Glutathione is one of several reversible bioconjugates of Glutathione that are stable in plasma, and that can be taken up by cells directly. De-acetylation is an ordinary occurrence in cells, and once in the cells, S-Acetyl-Glutathione is naturally de-acetylated to Glutathione. S-Acetyl-Glutathione contains one Acetyl group on the Sulfhydryl portion of the peptide. Intracellularly, the Acetyl group is removed to replenish Glutathione for mitochondrial action.*
Other enhanced absorption Glutathione preparations, such as liposomal forms or suppositories, can be difficult or unpleasant for some to make use of. Acetyl-Glutathione, in contrast, has none of these problems, and is easy to take. Taking Acetyl-Glutathione with Vitamin C may enhance the properties of both

Andropause or male menopause is a name that has been given to a supposed menopause-like condition in middle-aged men. This may relate to a reduction of the production of the hormones testosterone and dehydrogenate in middle-aged men, and the consequences of that reduction, which is associated with a decrease in Leydig cells.
Unlike women, middle-aged men do not experience a complete and permanent physiological shutting down of the reproductive system. A steady decline in testosterone levels with age (in both men and women) is well documented,[4]. There is on-going professional disagreement about whether or not "andropause" should be considered a normal "state" (the term used by MeSH), or a disorder.
Andropause is usually caused by a very gradual testosterone deficiency and an increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) that occurs from age 35 onwards. By contrast, women have a sudden onset of menopause around age 51. Testosterone declines 10% every decade after age 30 (1% per year).
With allergy season in full bloom, BioResource recommends the following remedy guidelines for providing patients with fast relief of symptoms:
Syntrion SyAllgen tablets: Take one under the tongue every 2 hours to start, reduce as symptoms subside to 3 times per day
Syntrion SyAllgen lotion: Apply to Sinus areas, behind ears and to throat with each dose of SyAllgen tablets
PEKANA PROALLER, 1/4 to 1/2 tsp every 2 hours to start, reduce as symptoms subside to 3 times per day
Note: The above guidelines usually result in notable improvement within one day, and will begin to create changes in the terrain that lead to a less allergically triggered state in future allergy seasons. If a less than impressive response is noted, this can be due to one of the following conditions:
Intestinal overgrowth with Candida, Helminths, or certain protozoans, can trigger an allergic upregulation. In this case, the above guidelines are for palliative care, and root treatment will address the gut.
Significant adrenal fatigue. Some basic regulation of the adrenal cortical hormones is necessary for SyAllgen to be effective. Consider PEKANA NEU-regen and appropriate rest and stress-management.
The cornerstone of his theory is D’Adamo’s premise that lectins in foods react differently with each ABO blood type. Throughout his books he cites the works of various biochemists and glycobiologists who have researched blood groups, claiming or implying that their research supports this theory. In his book, Eat Right 4 Your Type, "Lectins: The Diet Connection", and in following chapters, "lectins" which interact with the different ABO type "antigens" are described as incompatible and harmful, therefore the selection of different foods for A, AB, B, and O types to minimize reactions with these lectins.
D'Adamo bases his ideas on the ABO classification of Karl Landsteiner and Jan Janský, and some of the many other tissue surface antigens and classification systems, in particular the Lewis antigen system for ABH secretor status. [2]
The evolutionary theory of blood groups, which is also used by D'Adamo, stems from work by William C. Boyd, an immunochemist and blood type anthropologist who made a worldwide survey of the distribution of blood groups. In his book Genetics and the races of man: An introduction to modern physical anthropology, published in 1950, Boyd describes how by genetic analysis of blood groups, human races are populations that differ according to their alleles. On this basis, Boyd divided the world population into 13 geographically distinct races with slightly different frequency distributions of blood group genes.
D'Adamo groups those thirteen races together by ABO blood group, each type within this group having unique dietary recommendations:
Blood group O - the hunter, the earliest human blood group. The diet recommends that these supposedly muscular, active people eat a meat-rich diet.
Blood group A - called the cultivator by D'Adamo, who believes it to be a more recently evolved blood type, dating back from the dawn of agriculture. The diet recommends that individuals of blood group A eat a diet emphasizing vegetables and free of red meat, a more vegetarian food intake.
Blood group B - according to D'Adamo, the nomad, associated with a strong immune system and a flexible digestive system. The blood type diet claims that people of blood type B are the only ones who can thrive on dairy products.
Blood group AB - per D'Adamo, the enigma, the most recently evolved type. In terms of dietary needs, his blood type diet
Introducing a complete line of well researched medicinal mushrooms for immune enhancement and energy vitality.
Forrest Health Online offers a full selection of highest quality medicinal mushrooms from trusted professional companies.
Mushrooms have a rich and intriguing history of use as both food and medicine that dates back more than ten thousand years. They are loaded with valuable constituents that work in myriad ways to support host defense—the body’s natural response to environmental and microbial stressors.
The most promising amongst these are beta-glucans, protein-bound polysaccharides, and arabinoxylanes. These compounds support the immune system both directly by promoting normal microbial balance, and indirectly by stimulating production of cells involved in host defense.
Additional mushroom compounds including triterpenes and sterole are powerful antioxidants, support hormonal health, promote a healthy inflammation response, support healthy cholesterol levels, maintain normal blood pressure, and support circulation and respiration.

Fatigue can have many causes. Overcoming fatigue, on a consistent basis requires that the underlying causes be understood and addressed. Below you will find the most common causes of fatigue. Generally when these areas are addressed energy levels come up and the feelings of vitality and well being increase.
In our clinic we ask a number of questions on every visit to asses the overall subjective experience of health and well being. These questions are on a scale of 1-10 with 7 being what we consider good health. Many of our patients come to us because their subjective experience of energy and vitality is below 7, often below 4.
If your energy levels are below 7/10 and you are suffering from fatigue and would like our help, we can help.
We offer a wide range of professional quality medical testing, nutritional programs and homeopathic remedies for those suffering from fatigue.

Now that my update is close to completion, I’ve the pleasure to test the gameplay and see the results of my work. For my first test, I play with Williams as it’s my favorite F1 team.
Senna (Lotus-Renault) is champion with 7 wins, 3 pts ahead from Prost (McLaren-TAG) with 6 wins. This is mainly due to reliability problems in the first part of the season for McLaren.
1 win with Mansell for Williams and 4th place in constructors standing. (1 McLaren 2 Lotus 3 Ferrari)
Driver retirement: Lauda, Rosberg & Tambay are retiring. It’s a bad news as it means my 2nd driver will be very weak.
I cannot keep Mansell as he decided to go at McLaren to face Prost during one year. My 1st driver choice was between Berger (3 years) & Patrese (2 years). I’ve sign for Berger but I know it will be difficult to win a title with him.
I was hoping to sign Piquet but he was the choice of Lotus (so Lotus has now a 100% Brazilian line-up with 2 World Champions drivers). I’ve sign Bellof as 2nd driver as it was only 1 year contract and the driver can give us a little edge in setup area.
Dream season for Lotus as Renault give them an engine at the level of Porsche & Honda, as McLaren suffers from poor slow corner area design in the beginning of the season, and finally as the best car at overall, mine, was driven by 2 non world class drivers.
The battle Senna-Piquet was an easy task for Senna as he wins the title with 10 wins, Piquet finish 2nd with 3 wins. 2nd battle between Mansell & Prost was won by Mansell. Again, poor luck for Prost! Maybe he was little depressed because of 1985 close lost…
1 win with Berger for Williams but a nice 2nd place in constructors standing. (1 Lotus 2 Williams 3 McLaren).
Mansell was agreed to return at home for 3 years. Now with a Mansell / Berger line-up, maybe I can win against Lotus & McLaren.
In 1989, -26% in aero / -22% in engine & +53% in setup & tires management. So, this last factor will be important in the future, I’ve to keep that in mind when recruiting in the end of 1988…
Prost took finally his revenge as McLaren give him a good car. He took easily the best against his teammates who was Boutsen. I’ve lost my 2nd constructors place against Lotus in the last race because of mechanical issue in Mansell’s car.
Draft: McLaren sign Senna for 2 years so now we’ll see the mythic duel between Prost & Senna! Lotus renew Piquet for 2 more years and sign Gugelmin for 1 year. Boutsen find a place at Benneton.
My engine choice was between Cosworth & Judd. I’ve opted for Cosworth during one year. McLaren opted for Judd during 3 years.
The duel was nice. Prost was 2pts ahead before the last two races. Engine problem at Suzuka for Senna, Prost can be champion if he wins but Mansell take the victory and Prost finish 2nd. Now he’s 8 pts ahead from Senna for the last race, Adelaïde. Prost on pole, Senna 2nd. It’s the day for Prost but this time it’s the Prost’s engine which blew up, Senna took the win and he’s World Champion one point ahead from Prost!
Pre-draft: Contract of Berger is expiring, I’ve to sign a driver for more than one year. Engine contract is expiring, I’ve also to find a new supplier for more than one year as the contract of my designer will expire at the end of 1989 season.
Draft: Renault, the best engine supplier at that time, is agree to sign with me a 3 years contract. Williams-Renault against McLaren-Judd, even if they still got a dream line-up, this time the title is for me I hope!
2nd driver will be Boutsen during 3 years, I could renew Berger but only for one year. Boutsen is slower but he’s the best setup/tires management feedback driver. In theory, with the FIA rules change, he’s a very good recruit as he’ll boost the performance of Mansell’s car.
As anticipated, Judd’s engine was too weak and our big rival was in fact Lotus powered by Honda. Mansell make a very good start in the season but a poor finish with only one race finished during the last four. Hopefully, it was a win because in the end he’s the new world champion only 4pts ahead from Piquet (Lotus). Prost took his revenge against Senna but sadly it was on a poor car…
Pre-Draft: Mansell’s contract is expiring, I have to sign a driver less or more than 2 years (because of the length of Boutsen). I have to find also a new designer or to renew Scalabroni contract (again not a 2 years length because of my engine deal)
I have to solve a bug with the car pictures change script which change the pictures in 1990 so my career is already over.
I like the idea, but there could be a room for improvement. I've several suggestions that could potentially make the game even better:
2. All seasons availlable with starting year of your choice (some may want to start form 1994 or even 1950)
Also, I think this platform could be used for other excel management games like this - like cycling (I'd like to know how this game works)
2. Not having fixed number of teams (13 at the moment) - some seasons feature more teams. This may require DNQ algorithm and even pre-qualifying system
I won't work anymore on this game (If I do smthg in the future, it will be from scratch and outside excel limitation). But the excel sheet of the game isn't protected so you can dig the code and do some changes in it if you want. You can then distribute your version, mine was free, so do what you want...
-Customizable starting year: requires lot of works and the game was designed to play during 30 seasons so that why it begins in 1985. There is a limitation of 100 drivers in the sheet. It's possible to rethink that but it requires big changes.
-Adjustable nbr of team: I've tried last year but it was unsuccessful. It's better to start from scratch to implemente this concept.
Sorry to hear that there will be no further updates on your behalf. Honestly I like the idea for an Open Source code and if there is a reboot it could be done on C# or VB with Windows Forms App and Access db.
Team slots - I've noticed that there are only 13 slots. I may expand them to 16 as some racing games (F1C and Mini Racing Online for example) support up to 32 drivers grid.

I've come to talk with you again because a vision softly creeping, left its seeds while I was sleeping. and the vision that was planted in my brain, still remains within the sound of silence. © signature by anaëlle.

People who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of many serious health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Extra pounds also are associated with a higher risk of cancer.
To help you lower your risk, there are lifestyle changes you can make – different ways to eat and to exercise. Long term, one of the most important changes you can make is maintaining a healthy weight.
We’re still learning how cancer develops, but there’s mounting evidence that losing weight can reduce the risk of breast cancer, especially after menopause. Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight can reduce levels of hormones like insulin, estrogens and androgens that are associated with cancer risk.
While annual mammograms are still key to early detection and successful treatment, maintaining a healthy weight is important to prevention. A guideline for doctors is BMI, or the ratio of a person’s weight and height. A normal BMI is between 18.5 and 24, with 25-29 considered overweight and 30 and higher considered obese. You can use this online tool to calculate your BMI.
A plant-based diet can contribute to lowering the risk of cancer. A plant-based diet consists primarily of fruits, vegetables, beans/legumes, nuts/seeds and whole grains. The Mediterranean diet is based in vegetables, fruit, fish and olive oil. Both diets have been associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer. Talk with your doctor about an eating plan that’s appropriate for you.

The Rubery Festival was supposed to be today. The fun fair is there, but the festival had to be cancelled due to the weather. Parts of St Chad's Park are flooded and much of the rest is a muddy mess. We took DanDan and Ethne round to see whether there was anything that they could ride on at the fun fair, which thankfully there was and they did seem to enjoy themselves. However, they did manage to extract a small fortune from us!
It's a shame the festival was cancelled as the event last year got nearly the whole village turning out. While we saw several neighbours walking round today, it wasn't exactly packed. Nicole was really looking forward to the singing competition, but it turns out that that is being postponed until July or August. It's the kids who have worked towards the festival for the past weeks and months, who won't be able to join the parade or do their performances in the "main arena", that I feel sorry for. Hopefully the weather will be a little better next year.
However, the signposts marking off where the festival arena was supposed to start from the fair, did cause a bit of confusion. Is the council really selling off half of St Chad's Park? Advertising is one thing, courting controvesy is just irritating.

It is important for an injured worker to understand why their worker’s compensation benefits have been denied before filing a personal injury claim. According to the website of the LaMarca Law Group, P.C., there is a variety of reasons why a worker’s compensation benefit can be denied, knowing the main reason for the denial of benefit would be the key in ensuring that the situation is addressed and dealt with properly. To help with such scenarios, here are some reasons why workers’ compensation is denied:
No witnesses and not reporting the incident immediately could to lead to holes in the documentation and lack of proof. Without a witness, it will only be based on your statement, which can then be argued by the insurance company. Furthermore, the state often requires workers to report any injury or accident within a very short amount of time, otherwise they can dispute that the injuries were not serious enough to warrant worker’s compensation.
Inconsistency between your accident report and the initial medical report. Discrepancies in your report can become an issue of its validity. Likewise, medical records that reveal the presence of illicit drugs will greatly lessen the chance of a worker’s compensation grant.
Filing a claim after being laid off or fired can make the insurance companies think that the claim is only made as revenge to get more money. Although there are honest claims after injuries, it may be harder to convince the court that it is not a revenge claim.
Providing a recorded statement or signing medical authorizations can be a double-edge sword; a recorded statement still does not guarantee that the compensation will be approved, but refusing to provide one can result to the claim being denied. Similarly, it is usually for insurance companies to ask for a medical authorization so that they can directly contact the injured worker’s health care providers to have a copy of the medical bills and records. They often choose to get the records themselves to avoid the record being cherry-picked; however, they can also invade privacy and take medical records that are not related to the accident. The injured worker is not legally obligated to provide these recorded statements and medical authorization, and can request the assistance of their lawyer.
A Champaign workers’ comp lawyer is likely to be aware of how injured workers who have been denied their right for worker’s compensationcan file injury claims against the company or the person who caused the accident.
Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is considered a chronic systemic disease defined by severe pain, swelling in the affected area, and changes on the skin. The most common affected areas are the limbs, such as the arms and legs, following a serious injury or trauma to that particular part of the body. Although the cause of CPRS is not completely determined, it is widely believed to be due to damage to or the malfunction of the central and peripheral nervous system.
Symptoms of CPRS are varied in their length and severity; constant and intense pain that worsens rather than getting better as time passes is the most common that is reported. CPRS is divided into two general groups; Type 1, where there is no distinct evidence of nerve lesions and is the most common type, and Type 2 that has more obvious nerve lesions and rates higher on the McGill pain scale. CPRS can lead to a number of complications that can become intolerable and debilitating. Such conditions can be a hindrance to work, which prompts many affected by CPRS to apply for SSDI disability benefits. According to the website of the Hankey Law Office, those who have suffered CPRS for more than 12 months can qualify for an SSDI benefit.
There are certain requirements that should be met before the Social Security Administration grants an SSDI benefit. First, the condition should be considered a “medically determinable impairment” that proves evidence of RSD. Next, they will establish whether you are still capable of performing your old tasks and see if there are other work opportunities for you. Because it can be a significant factor for a worker to lose their job, getting workers’ compensation or filing a personal injury claim against the company or the person who caused the injury that worsened the CPRS can be helpful.
According to the website of personal injury lawyers at the Mazin & Associates law firm, is important to present strong and valid evidence of the effects of the CPRS in order to qualify for an SSDI benefit. Because of the difficulty of getting disability benefits for chronic pain finding legal help through personal injury or disability lawyers would be the best way to avoid being denied. These legal help plays an essential part in representing your case in court and fight for your right of benefits.

I've got a capsule forming in my right breast. Saw my surgeon last year and he said to keep massaging and that he was happy to leave it until it caused me discomfort as I was in no rush for surgery and it wasn't too bad.
My right boob has steadily got harder, and recently I am getting pain in my right arm. It's a low level ache that's getting more and more constant. Do you think this is connected to the CC? I'd also like to know if there are any other treatments that you know of other than a full capsuletomy? I earn a third of the money now that I earned when I first had my surgery and I can't afford an op.
I'm feeling really upset about the pain and the situation and that fact I don't really know what to do. Worse still I'm single now and my boobs are stopping me wanting to meet anyone because I just feel horrible :(((.
Hi. So sorry to hear that your experiencing this. I didn't want to read and run but I have no helpful advise on the matter. Maybe post on realself with a photo, you can get some advise from different surgeons. Hopefully someone here will have something more useful for you. All the best x
Hello!! Sorry to hear you are having problems - take a look at the recent posts as wildflower on here has had a similar problem and she has managed to really improve her cc but massage and conpression techniques - she got the info from an American website - I'm on my phone but will try and dig it out for you later. I've seen her trail and the difference is amazing although she was only 9 months post op.
Do you have smooth implants? If so you are advised to massage but it is different for textured implants so worth checking with your surgeon before you try any techniques online.
Well done Lucy. So totally forgot about wildflower and it was the only other day. Gosh my brain. [You must be registered and logged in to see this link.] the post is on this forum (is actually the post below this one at the mo) titled capsular contracture improvement by [You must be registered and logged in to see this link.]. Hopefully she will see this and can off advice x
I did an online test for ASPEN rehabilitation to see if I was suitable, I would recommend doing that too, I was going to go to the states to get this treatment as a holiday as its so much cheaper than revision and no negative side affects atall, but ended up giving it a go myself and had good results, I'll link you to my post anyway.
I'm pretty sure it will work at any time after surgery, and if u caught the CC early then thats good, but I am also pretty sure you need to have smooth implants to be able to do it, but feel free to message me anyway because I have had so much improvement! And it was only last week it all happened.
Ladies thank you so much. I will read everything you recommend wildflower, thank you. I think my implants are textured though :-/. However when I last saw the surgeon he did say to massage it as it might delay the capsules progress. I thought you couldn't massage textured implants, but have done as he said. Thanks for the reading I will make that my job to do tonight. I can't ignore the situation any longer, I've had to hit the painkillers today for the first time so something needs to happen sooner rather than later.
I had a capsulectomy which is different to a capsylotomy as it's scoring the capsule to release the tightness around the implant. However as your implants are 5 years old you may want to consider changing them at the same time. Certain implants have lower risk of cc. As for money I don't really know what to suggest I'm afraid x
If the boob is getting harder and the pain is travelling down your arm, I really dont think any massage is going to cut it now. You've tried to delay the process, but sometimes these things are inevitable. I would go back to your surgeon and discuss your options. It may be that a portion of the re-op is still covered by your aftercare, so it wouldnt cost nearly as much.
I read the info on the Aspen site. The massage I have been doing seems very similar in technique. Does anybody know of anyone who has had External Ultrasound treatment? Is it available anywhere in the UK ? I can't find much mention of it anywhere else other than that Aspen site.
Loui1981, thanks for telling me about your capsulotomy. When I went to the surgeon when I initially felt there was a problem (the time he sent me away to just do massage), he didn't mention that as an option. But you're right, after five years it's probably better to replace. I don't know. Did you have any pains in your arms before your op? I am getting persistent aching in the arm at the same side as my affected boob.
Can I ask, if I have a capsule in only one breast, but both implants are 5 years old, would they normally replace both implants or just one? Will they be uneven then? Do they normally need to replace with a bigger implant?
Also, I had no aftercare/insurance with my first surgery (I know, I can't believe I was that stupid either). If I was to go to a different surgeon/company for my next op, would they offer aftercare if you've already had a capsule problem?
If anyone can give me any more info on anything to do with my issues I'd really appreciate it. Feeling really miserable about it.
I can't offer any advise on your list of questions but can only suggest you go back to your PS and make him take more thAt your pain is also in your arm. You could also book a for second opinion with another surgeon and see what they say re re op and aftercare (I'm sure they would cover you, it's a completely new op). Best of luck x

We found a guy by the name of Dale Crouch out of Rising Sun MD that sells methanol. The last 55 gallon drum we bought was $155.00 which Dale said was a little high at the time. He said summer should show better prices.
We found KOH in York PA for about $72.00 for a 50 pound bag from a company called North Metal and Chemical company.
Hello Bucks, I have a bunch of KOH Glycerine I am looking to get rid of, I have a couple interested parties give an e-mail at gold4@comcast.net and I can add you top the list.
We are up and running. We have made over 500 gallons of bio now. You said that you are interested in glycerin even if it has methanol in it? Well, we are starting to produce quite a bit of that now. I am also interested in prices for 50 lb. bags of KOH. I live in northern DE if you are interested. How do I get in touch with you?
This is part of the M2M Series, Moving with Kids…Successfully: A 4 Part Series. To read the other parts, please click here.
I feel like I’ve been living this selling/buying/moving chaos for so long, I had to chronicle it for the sake of others…whether it is for sheer comical entertainment or the remote possibility that there might be some nuggets of wisdom to glean from it. Doubtful, but I’ll leave that up to you.
My husband purchased our first home in 2001 before he and I met. With three bedrooms, two and a half baths and 1440 square feet on a quarter acre lot, it was very roomie for a bachelor and his dog and cat. When I moved in the summer of 2005 with my dog and another cat, it got a little less roomy, but still very adequate for newlyweds.
In 2007 we found out we were expecting our first child and thought very seriously about moving, but it never panned out. Then the market tanked. Five years and three kids later, we expanded our home to add a second living room and 300 more square feet, still toying with the idea of selling. But, again, it never came to fruition.
We continued to improve our house and land; updating appliances, adding new flooring, building an 8×12 shed and sprucing up the yards. However, despite the dream of another place still in the back of our minds, we always chose to “love the one we’re with.”
Awhile back, my husband decided to attend a brewer’s conference to find out more information about starting up a nano brewery. He had been homebrewing in our attached garage as a hobby for several years and it was a dream to think of turning it into a family business. We found out in order to get licensed to legally sell his craft beer, we would first need a detached space where he could brew. Enter our new incentive to move.
We continued to watch the market slowly creep back up, and checked religiously online each day for our next, prospective home, but because of vacation travel and the time it would take to make all the necessary fixes with three young children in the home, we put it off yet again. Months went by and our home’s value kept going up, so we decided to take the plunge. We slowly worked on the project checklist and set a goal date to have everything done in time to list the house. There were a couple properties that would totally work if we could just get our house ready to sell in time to put an offer down, which served as even more incentive.
It was just after Christmas; we got home from traveling, and on less than four hours sleep from our long drive, my husband and I hit the ground running. For two weeks straight, we went from room to room, deep cleaning, decluttering, repainting and making all the necessary repairs on our list. I went into drill sergeant mode, working all day long at my tasks, fighting with my husband about the to-do list and nagging at the kids for simply touching the walls. Gone were the days of playing with my children, homeschooling or meal planning; I was a woman on a mission. My back was killing me from hunching over all the time, my hands raw and peeling from scrubbing with cleaners.
We painted when the kids were in bed so it would have the night to dry, and we used baby gates that had been stored in the garage for years to keep them out of rooms we were fixing up. They watched more TV in the span of two weeks than they had in their entire lives and I lost count of how many trips to Lowes and Home Depot we took. Everyone was cranky and on eggshells with each other. “It’s only temporary” and “It will be worth it when we are all settled into our new place” became my daily mantra when I was so tired of cleaning, when I couldn’t pull one more weed or listen to another, “mommy, PLAY with me” whine.
FINALLY, the day for signing papers and taking pictures with our real estate broker came. The house looked AMAZING and it was a perfect sunny day. We staged all the rooms beautifully and my dad took the kids out so we could concentrate on getting it all just right. I thought I had done a good job of making the home clean and decluttered enough for the staging pictures, but I was completely unprepared for how much farther our photographer would take it. In the pictures, he turned our very kid-friendly place into a chic model home!
After the pictures were taken and papers were signed, I heaved a huge sigh of relief. Finally, the hard part was over. All I would have to do from then on was tidy up a bit whenever a showing was scheduled, and with any luck, it wouldn’t be too long before we accepted an offer and our family could go back to living like the slobs we were!
Our listing was scheduled to go live two days after the pictures and it was the longest forty-eight hours of my life! After working my tail off for two weeks straight, I didn’t know what to do with myself, or my kids, while we waited. They were in heaven that mommy had time to play with, read to and homeschool them again, and I was thrilled to be doing anything but back-breaking house prep.
Finally, listing day came and much to my chagrin, it was entirely anticlimactic. I had pictured in my head being bombarded with interest to see our home that first weekend and having to be out of the house for days because of back-to-back showings. However, that was not the reality. It was torture just waiting every last minute, sitting around a clean house with entertained children, willing the phone to ring. But by Sunday night we had only one showing. Yup, ONE.
So the first weekend ended and I was more than a little disappointed. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday came and it was like crickets. Really? No one looks at homes during the week? Just on the weekend? The following weekend was the same. Only one call, only one showing. Then we had Broker’s Tour open houses two Tuesdays in a row, and no one came to those either. I was so frustrated that I had cleaned, turned on every light in the house and took with my kids and dogs away for two hours TWICE for nothing. I seriously cannot remember another time I had vacuumed, swept the floors and kept dishes out of the sink for ten days straight.
I was starting to get really disheartened. Weeks before, I had hoped that within the first day or two and the first couple showings offers would begin pouring in. What was wrong? Did we list at a bad time? Was our home too overpriced? Why wasn’t there more interest in seeing it and moreover, why didn’t we have an offer yet?
My husband tried to reassure me that it was good we didn’t have any offers yet, because we had no place to go either. And he was right. Any offer we accepted on our home would have to be on the contingent that we find our next home. So I finally began to ask God for His peace and for this to happen in His timing. I knew that even the best laid plans without God’s blessing will go to hell. It is so easy to build things up in my mind and start leaning on my own strength and trusting in my own will. I get prideful about things I shouldn’t. I hated feeling like that. I despised checking my phone all the time and barking at everyone because we’re missing “valuable showing” opportunities or getting irritated when nothing went as I expected. So, I prayed for peace and trust.
Almost immediately after I began to trust God with our home, we got our first mid-week showings. Thankfully I knew what to do with the kids after a two week ritual of preparing for the broker’s tours. I loaded the kids into the minivan, took the older one to school, and while a movie was playing in the car parked in the driveway for the younger two (thank God for rear entertainment systems!) I tidied up the house. We had a bin for all our valuables to go in (laptops, cameras, keys, etc) which I would also load into the car along with our two big dogs. We’d head to the library, a park or McDonald’s playland while we waited for our home to be looked at and I tried DESPERATELY not to obsess about!
After ten or twelve times of doing this, though, it started to get a little tiresome. I realized that some things would have to give. My insane, OCD to-do list for showings needed to be cut down. Not EVERYTHING had to be taken off the kitchen counters all the time, I didn’t scoop dog poop in the backyard (gasp) EVERY day or vacuum before each showing and I just couldn’t keep leaving every light in the house on for hours at a time!
By the third weekend we got our first offer. It was not great, so of course we countered, but they rejected it. I was super disappointed, but I remembered to trust that God would provide. And besides, we learned a lot and felt better prepared for the next time.
We continued to get at least one or two midweek showings each week, with only one or two weekend showing, but no more offers. By the time our home had been on the market for a month, I was sad about the circumstances, but completely at peace trusting God that He would bring just the right buyer at the right time. We decided not to lower our price, firmly believing our home was worth what we were asking.
Another month went by and beautiful weather came. Upon looking at our stats, it became apparent that February was the worst time of the year to list a home, with January as a close second. Okay, maybe you already knew that, but it was good for us to see spring and nicer weather beef up our listing views and calls for showings. We began to hear from people nearly every day, many of which were second showings! Every time I heard that it was a previous viewer, I got a little giddy with hope, but, again, days would go by and no offer.
As we approached three months of trying to sell our home, I realized I could no longer live in limbo. It just wasn’t healthy for my marriage and our kids. I changed my mindset from planning our life around showing schedules and possible closing/moving dates, to making those things fit around our family. I negotiated times with agents and their clients when it was convenient for us, and I went ahead and planned vacations and trips for the upcoming summer break, resolving that we would work it all out as offers came along.
After that, our whole family could breathe a little easier, knowing that even amidst the chaos of an eventual move, we could still have fun and plan enjoyable vacations.
My resolve was tested to the limit when I was out of town at a writer’s conference and my husband was home with all three kids, two dogs and a very messy house. We were bombarded with calls for showings and in my husband’s stress, the house was not as perfect as I always tried to make it. But in true God fashion, despite everything out of my control I came home to two offers, one of which was full-price! Of course we took it, countering only on the closing dates so we would have time to secure another house.
God did have a plan. He showed us when it was the ‘right’ time to let go of the place where my husband and I spent our first ten years together and brought all three babies home. Despite years of false alarms and days of disappointment, He knew just when the right time would be and who the right buyers were. I can now look back and be thankful we didn’t move all those other times. The long road certainly wasn’t easy and hardly fun, but the lesson of trust I learned and reward for waiting was well worth it!

Thanks for reading and saving, Kristy! Prayers for faith and strength as you get ready to embark on this crazy journey as well.
Moving will try anyone’s patience, especially the waiting part–kids or no kids. I loved your ‘staged’ vs. ‘reality’ photos.
Buying and selling will go down in my books as some of the most frustrating and anxious times of my life. I knew that things were progressing for you when I saw the picture above on FB. I am excited for you and realize that your “fun” is not over yet. Best of luck!
Love this post – and the pictures! Just went through a move and getting ready to start renovations this summer. I have pinned your post here: https://www.pinterest.com/WordofMom/best-of-linky-party-links/ A great source just when school is out and families are moving ! Thanks for keeping it real. Rhonda
Having moved a few times with my husband’s job with kids, I know just how hard it can be. I wish I had this list during that time, but I will definitely be keeping some of these tips for the future just in case.
We’ve moved with kids multiple times and the whole sale process is really stressful. I believe the one that was the most pressure was when we moved with our 3 month old first born. My mother was staying with us to help and she and our realtor packed us because I was still up all night with a newborn and not thinking straight period. I wouldn’t recommend that to anyone!
Oh, wow, that would be tough! It would drive me bonkers to have someone else packing my stuff. I am way too much of a control freak, LOL
I do not like moving at all, and I can understand your frustration on the waiting process. Your move to the new place will go smoothly as you are already organized with packing things away so the house looks nice for showing. May you enjoy your next home and space to spread out a bit. Thank you for sharing at Tell me a Story.
Having owned three homes myself, I can totally relate with moving so many times. I love those photos of ‘Staged’ vs ‘Reality’!
we moved 2 years ago -it was ALOT of work but now we are happily settled I hope for the next 100 years!
I am currently getting ready to move out of my apartment and then back in. Our complex is going through an extensive remodel so we have to move everything completely out, relocate for 2 weeks, then move back in. I have already started packing but it is such an overwhelming process. The uncertainty and the waiting is the worst!
Oh my goodness! Having to move out and then move back into the same place! I can’t imagine the annoyance. Blessings and peace to you during this season!
LOL, yes, those were actually the photographer’s pictures and then the REAL pictures less than 24 hours later! Thanks for reading, Jennifer, I love participating in SHINE every week!
Selling a home is always stressful, My husband retired from the military and we moved every 3-5 years with many houses bought and sold during that time. Congratulations on the sale of your home. Thanks for sharing your story with us at the Let’s Get Real Link Party. I hope you’ll join us again. PLus we’d love to have you join our Facebook group at https://www.facebook.com/groups/604083256377973/?fref=nf

Steven Gerrard said that his Rangers team was spurred on by comments from Osijek as they advanced 2-1 on aggregate in the Europa League second qualifying round on Thursday.
Rangers conceded their first goal in four matches under new coach Steven Gerrard on Thursday but it failed to dampen the Scottish side's spirits as their 1-1 draw with the Croatian side saw them advance to the third qualifying round of the Europa League.
And the Rangers boss said his team responded to comments from Osijek midfielder Robert Mudrazija who claimed his side were "better, stronger and more skilful" before the match.
He said: "Talking doesn't win you football matches, it doesn't get you results. Sometimes it doesn't help your players, it just motivates the opposition.
"We thrive on all that kind of talk. We enjoyed it. My players came out and played like men and we did our talking on the pitch."
Rangers were "excellent" for long stretches of the game against a side that former Liverpool great Gerrard tipped to be Croatian champions this season.
"They deserve an awful lot of credit as they have beaten a very good team, a dangerous team and I believe they will go on and win the Croatian league," he told RangersTV.
Rangers took the lead in the 53rd minute through their Croatian defender Nikola Katic, who headed home from close range after Osijek goalkeeper Marko Malenica failed to deal with a free kick.
Rangers passed up a host of chances to kill the game off and when Osijek's Borna Barisic drove home through a ruck of players in the last minute it set up a nervy finale for the home side.
However, they held on to see out the game and secured a place in the next round against Slovenian side Maribor.
"I think we had some good chances in the game at important times, and if we take one of them, the game is dead," added Gerrard.
"But we always knew if they got a little bit of luck or a break -- as they did with a deflection -- it was always going to be a little bit tense at the end."
Gerrard was named Rangers manager in May and has brought in 10 players as he looks to end the dominance of Glasgow rivals Celtic, who have won the league for seven successive years and completed an unprecedented "double-treble" last season with victories in the league and both domestic cup competitions.

It’s that wonderful time of year when it’s time to indulge in one of the true delicacies of the world. Forget the artificial truffle oil (redundant) of the ’90s – the real thing has a season and the time to enjoy white truffles is now.
Of course, at two to three thousand dollars per pound, it’s quite easy to break the bank while partaking. Fortunately, I’ve got a lot of options in different forms (cocktails! tasting menus! burgers!) and price points that will ensure you’re able to get your fungi fix.

Decisions will be made as a collective whether or not we decide to personally participate, so why not embrace it?

I’m always appreciative of opportunities to try visiting chefs’ food. A couple weeks ago, on the occasion of the Lexus-sponsored Los Angeles Food & Wine‘s 70-event extravaganza, I had the chance to do so at one of the Friday afternoon not-so-power lunches held all over town (Though in the case of Chef “star power,” yes – it was very powerful). It was held at WP24 in conjuction with Executive Chef Sara Johannes, who contributed half of the 4 courses served at the sold-out lunch.
With his title as one of the winningest Iron Chefs no doubt contributing to the buzz, Chef Morimoto and Chef Johannes sent out passed appetizers, a couple of which I never got to try. I’ll have to return to try out those seared foie gras bao buns and steamed XO scallops with hot oil, scallions & ginger – but the spoonfuls of Parmesan “Tofu” and Lobster & Scallop Shiu Mais were tasty enough as starters.
The true standouts, though, were the four courses at the center of the lunch. Never had I had geoduck so tender and the snapper tasted nothing short of beautiful. The papaya and coconut foam were perfect touches to the seafood. It was a refreshing start, and I couldn’t wait for more.
The next course that came up was Sara Johannes’ (and WP24’s) masterpiece – a Peking Style Duck Breast. It came with Warm Chantrelle Salad, the frisee of which tasted like roasted mushrooms, and Ten-Spiced Confit Figs and Smoked Duck Cracklin’. The cracklin was indeed a very nice touch, making a hyperbole of the importance of a crispy duck skin. The figs really completed the platter, adding a tenderized, spice componentÂ to the perfectly-cooked richness of the duck. I have to say that this was probably the best dish I’ve had in a very long time.
The Washugyu (a hybrid between Japanese Black Wagyu and fine American Black Angus) flat iron steak was incredibly delicious thanks to its beautiful marbling, but what really floored me was the tenderness of the veal cheeks within their slight, tempura breading. The veal cheeks were probably twice as tender as the already soft beef. The sweet soy was subtle enough to really enhance the flavors of the meat and let the cuts sing on their own.
The dessert that concludedÂ our afternoon was no less impressive than any of the other courses, thanks to brand-new-to-WP24 pastry chef Cassie Ballard. Sure, you couldn’t really tell it was edamame ice cream until you read the menu (after that, it all clicks), but that sesame crisp is so simple yet ingenius. And tasty.Â Coupled with a Caramel Roasted Apple tart andÂ Butterscotch Miso, the dessert really comes together. It was lightÂ enough weight to elegantly close out the wonderful lunch yet left all our sweetÂ teethÂ satisfied (hello, caramel!).
If the food at WP24 isÂ anything like the refined courses I had during this particular Lexus-sponsored Los Angeles Food & Wine event, it’s clear that thereÂ is much, much more to a reservation there than itsÂ stellar, downtown views. And now,Â for that special occasion to make thatÂ return visit…
At Redcat in downtown on June 8, 2010, there will be a discussion on the Los Angeles food scene by none other than chefs most responsible for shaping the city that we all know and love to eat in, today. Observe the heavyweights wax poetic about their start in the industry, their proteges, and where exactly they think LA’s culinary landscapeÂ is headed, next. The panel will take place from 7 – 8 PM with a Q&A by the audience to follow.
What’s more, Starry Kitchen will cater the event afterwards with their delicious home-cooked Thai/Vietnamese-influenced food as chefs and guests mingle. This event is free but space is limited.

Yes, I would actually. I've never seen a problem myself with having some cars looking a little less pretty than others if it means a decent selection is available. To me, existing in ugly form (relatively speaking) is better than not existing at all
I can't because I don't have room for two consoles by the TV. Unless the XB1 turns out to be backwards compatible.... oh, wait, that's confirmed as not being the case too
They've got some major PR to do to bring back a lot of community. Lets hope new features and new paint addresses a bit

This is probably old news but it looks like Nurburgring will be coming in January as dlc ,so god knows how many other tracks might make it back as cash cow dlc ?
Tracks will come as DLC the same as cars will be. Its the games industry now. Forza is the only game I get DLC for (unless other games have big discounts) and not such a biggy. I would be happy to throw £5-10 a month at Forza for extra stuff.
We know that the 'Nurb' is coming as DLC, but there has been no confirmation of any others. And given T10's reluctance to release track DLC in the past due to low interest, i'm not sure its such a certainty that it will happen this time.
I know you're trying to see the positives mate, and i understand the whole 'dlc is the future of the games industry' thing and i agree it is, but i'm still extremely disappointed at the amount of content that has been missed compared to their previous titles. Its difficult to get excited about half the content of previous games regardless of it being a new console, especially at a much higher price, including console.
As stated in the Forza 5 thread I am disappointed but there is not a lot we can do about it apart from hoping that FM6 will be the "fuller" version. For now I will look forward to the new generation and what it has to offer. Don't get me wrong at all...im pretty p****d that there is not as much to offer, especially after scrimping on everything to save for the coonsole.
I also would not get your hopes up either. The ring has not been officially confirmed by anyone. Currently it is just hearsay the same as Monza and long Beach is.
Time will tell and T10's intentions will be seen over the 2 year period. I dont think there is a single Forza player who is not a little unhappy at the moment.
Luckily I enjoy Battlefield as much and look forward to game such as Titanfall and Project Spark. Add the fact the XB1 IS my entertainment hub and Forza5 is not the be all and end all for me. Others I can see why they would want to wait.
Look at game apps at the minute with the "in app" purchases. They annoy me even more as some games are impossible to beat without them. At least with DLC it improves the game rather than making it a necessity.
They can add as much track DLC as they like.. but its going to be mostly unusable for online play as everyone needs to have it.
I am suprised! Its flat, boring and generic. Personally I can't stand it. Surprised Tilke never had a role in the design
Sorry about that. Not a great day at work, so to come home to find that the £jaw-dropping" announcement about my next major purchase is jaw-dropping for what it excludes rather than includes was more than enough to knock my FM5 anticipation on the head for a while.

Day 3 of training. This morning we took our big team picture on one of the dive boats. After that we spent some time with Otter and Ross going over some of the major safety and emergency stuff for the mission. We also talked about the kind of things we can "pot" down with us. Every time they send something down to us or bring something up to the surface they call it "potting"-- and they are actually using big, metal sealed pots to do it. So we are kind of limited on the volume of stuff we can take down. After the brief we went downstairs and played in the street with refreshing on compass navigation and how to use the special cave reels we'll have on our rigs. Then we grabbed a quick bite to eat and off to the boat for another training dive. Today the temp warmed up a bit, but the wind is blowing so we had some "nice" chop to look forward to -- sea state was about 4-6' swells. Yee ha!
Once we were in the water it was great --no more of the bobbing and sloshing around on the surface. But the next thing to contend with was the "moderate" current of >
1 kt (doesn't sound like much, but let's just say at one point I had flashbacks of the 152 flying days with a headwind and watching traffic on the ground passing me...) Anyhoo, safe to say I got a good leg work out on this dive. The drills we practiced on this dive were a lost diver search, swimming sharing air, and a milestone for me was the mask off shutdown drill!! Another woo hoo for this one. Actually after all the practice I did in the NBL, it wasn't bad. We had a nice rolling ride home. Then we spent some time looking over all the hardware we'll be taking down with us for the science -- in the space program they call this a bench review -- really the last time you get to touch the hardware before you end up seeing it during your mission. It's gonna be fun!

What to do with a butternut Squash? That's what I keep asking myself and still haven't come to the conclusion of what I want to do with it. Plus with a wonderful gift of Mexican Vanilla extract to use it really is a conundrum to figure out what make from these things.
So off to Google I went and I found a lovely recipe from one of my favorite Food Tv Stars, Giada De Laurentiis called Butternut Squash and Vanilla Risotto. Sounds perfect until I read to simmer the butternut squash in the broth. I began thinking about the texture and was like no thank you! So with a few tweaks,I came up with this recipe.
I will say this though, I did not have all the ingredients as I planed so instead of white wine I used a splash of Vermouth. It was okay I have never used it before in cooking and to be honest I am not even sure you should. I loved this dish! Randy said he did but wasn't as enthusiastic about it as I am. I just wish I can eventually get my risotto to look like those that I have seen in Italy and on t.v.
The Mexican Vanilla was subtle and not over powering at all, I think if I didn't use the Vermouth then you would have had a more predominate taste rather than a secondary after flavor. I also had a 5 lbs Butternut Squash and I diced it into cubes. For me I would add more of the Butternut Squash because Now I have more than half leftover. That or buy a smaller squash but hell how can you beat the price of 2.00 at the Farm Stand?
Peel the butternut squash, remove the seeds, and cut it into 3/4-inch cubes. Place the squash on a sheet pan and toss it with the olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Roast for 25 to 30 minutes, tossing once, until very tender. Set aside.
In a large Pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add your onion and saute until translucent. Add the rice and stir to coat with the melted butter. Add the 1/2 cup wine and simmer until the wine is almost evaporated. This should take roughly 3 to 4 minutes.
Add a cup of heated broth to the rice and stir until it is almost absorbed. This should take another 3 to 4 minutes. Add the Teaspoon of Mexican Vanilla. Repeat until the rice is tender and creamy in consistency about 30 minutes.
Remove from heat and add the butternut squash, Parmesan, and remaining Tablespoon of butter. Mix well and transfer to your favorite dish or bowls and serve immediately.

The goal is to provide a thorough foundation of the key concepts in international finance, with some of the topics also touching upon international macroeconomics and trade, while others are more finance focused. A closely related intention of the course is to give the students a good idea of the current frontier of research in selected areas of international finance, and thus ultimately to prepare them to do original work. The course assumes that students have taken the first-year macro, micro and econometrics sequences.
Students will be assessed on the basis of three elements; first, an essay/brief term paper (30%) and presentation thereof (20%) addressing a specific question/paper in an area of choice; second, an empirical exercise with data using an econometric software (30%); and third, class participation (20%).
Readings for each topic provided below are preliminary. An updated and more detailed reading list, distinguishing between core/required readings (marked blue) and additional readings, will be provided at the beginning of the course. Students are expected to have at least browsed through the required readings before class.
Mondays and Fridays from 12.00 – 14.00, starting from 31 March onwards for the first half of the semester.

Racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance continue to threaten security in the increasingly diverse societies of the OSCE region. The Organization therefore dedicates resources and efforts to promote tolerance and non-discrimination that foster a stronger sense of security in its participating States.
The OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) has developed a collection of resources and programmes to raise awareness about discrimination, hate crimes, anti-Semitism and other forms of intolerance, including against Muslims, Christians and members of other religions. Through policy advice and training for law enforcement personnel and educators, the Office works to strengthen the capacity of governments to prevent and respond to this problem. ODIHR also works to increase the ability of civil society to monitor and report on hate crimes and incidents.
A number of OSCE field operations work on tolerance and non-discrimination, particularly through the following activities:
Working with religious leaders, young people and school officials to promote tolerance, inter-faith dialogue and acceptance of diversity;
Working with anti-discrimination institutions to help implement legal frameworks in support of equality for all;
Safeguarding ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identities of persons belonging to minorities.

Good and effective legislation is the foundation of every functioning state based on the rule of law. Laws should be adopted through democratic procedures and be clear and concise. To ensure the quality and effectiveness of laws related to the human dimension, ODIHR supports participating States by reviewing their law-making systems and relevant draft and existing legislation. In providing such support, the Office draws on legislative guidelines in specific areas, such as election, freedom of assembly and political party legislation, as well as the resources of Legislationline.org, ODIHR’s online legislative database.

The Mission supports Serbia’s anti-discrimination institutions, primarily the Office of the Commissioner for Protection of Equality, and works with the authorities and civil society to help implement the legal framework in support of equality for all. It carries out training programmes for judges and public prosecutors, and helps the Office for Human and Minority Rights implement Serbia’s anti-discrimination strategy. It also supports “legal clinics” at law faculties, where victims of discrimination can obtain free legal aid, and works with state institutions and non-governmental organizations that monitor and report on hate crimes.

Whether you would like to study language to broaden your cultural skills, or are thinking of living abroad, learning a foreign language may help you land a job after graduation. If you want to learn French, there's no easy way around straight memorization, writing practice, and vocabulary drills. If you note that a young child can pick up a new language in under four years just by watching movies and listening to others, think what you can do with concentrated language study. The Foreign Service Institute has developed a series of French learning programs, and there are iTunes courses to download for free. The Rosetta Stone program, on the other hand, is a software-based introduction to basic French vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar.
Many foreign language departments will have French courses available if you're seeking college credit via the AP French Language and Culture Exam. Advanced Placement exams (AP Exams) are offered in a variety of linguistic subjects, offering college credit for language fluency that you have acquired. Test yourself with free written exams before visiting the College Board website to register to take your actual AP Tests. If you earn a score of 3 or higher on the AP French Language and Culture Exam, for example, you may be granted advanced placement in college.
As the US economy keeps improving, many school districts are seeking to hire new graduates in the fields of language studies, movie subtitling, and language interpretation. Whether you have experience in French language instruction, or are a new college graduate, this may be the right time to advance your career path. Jobs for French majors are always in demand, and fields such as document translation, marketing, and office management are some of the fastest growing corporate fields. Finding out about Union County College human resources certificate, on the other hand, may broaden your college education in order to appeal to a wider variety of employers.

The 4-hour SAT test contains three sections, namely report writing, critical reading, and mathematics. Most of the questions are multiple-choice, although there is an essay writing section. Some colleges may also require you to take SAT subject tests. The College Board website provides detailed information about the SAT and subject tests. Alternatively, the ACT measures what you've learned in school, as opposed to the SAT, which focuses more on reasoning ability. The ACT consists of four multiple-choice tests: English, reading, mathematics, and science. If your college requires a writing test, you can take the ACT+ Writing. Other college admissions information sources, like Mount Wachusett Community College summer school reviews, promote the use of standardized tests in admissions decisions because there are substantial differences in course requirements, high school GPA, and grade curve difficulty among US schools. You can also explore Western Technical College course registration, in order to further target your academic interests.
Completing your college application means that you'll need to research admissions requirements, gather required information, and meet application deadlines. If possible, you should visit the campus, or at least exhaust online resources before applying. If you don't gain admission to the schools you want, you should consider taking a year off, in order to gain work experience, or travel abroad if you can afford it. Basically, applying to a few schools that really interest you is a much better idea than applying to as many colleges as you can.
High school grades are the single most important factor in gaining admission to the college of your choice, along with letters of recommendation and test scores. According to data on Emerson College partnership program pages, an ideal academic record consists of a high GPA in courses of progressive difficulty. About half of colleges use placement tests and a waiting list, and many community colleges have transfer agreements in place with bachelor's degree programs at four-year universities. You may compare UVM early action with other schools that you're considering.
Government scholarship programs and Pell grants only account for a third of total financial aid awarded in the US. Student loans, work-study earnings, and personal or family savings make up the remaining two-thirds. Please make use of Fresno City College financial aid kit information, to see if you qualify for need-based financial aid or a fee waiver. In fact, millions of students that would have qualified for some financial aid were late in submitting required application forms. Please note that the official FAFSA website is fafsa.ed.gov and is free to use. The earliest that the FAFSA form can be filled out is January of a student's senior year, so don't put it off.
If you are an undergraduate student, you may be eligible for up to $5,500 per year in Perkins Loans, depending on your financial need as calculated on the FAFSA application, the amount of other aid you receive, and the availability of funds at your college or career school. You may also receive between $7,000 and $12,500 per year in Direct Subsidized Loans. Finally, you may apply for Direct PLUS Loans in order to cover the remaining unmet balance of your tuition and living costs. Please note that a credit check is required for PLUS loans, while federal guaranteed loan programs are calculated on financial need alone.
Federal student loans typically offer borrowers lower interest rates and have more flexible repayment options than loans. Student loans are often saddled with an origination fee. Origination fees are a one-time charge based on the total amount of the loan. Financial aid may be administered via SIU Carbondale Pell Grant application or through academic departments. Alternatively, student credit cards may seem like a good short-term solution, but the interest rates are high, and credit cards often carry an annual fee. A credit card can help you build a credit history, if you use it wisely. But use it for emergencies only and don't spend more than you can afford to pay back. If you decide to get a credit card, make sure you understand the terms, and try to meet your minimum monthly payments on time. If you do not, the credit card companies can raise your interest rate suddenly and without prior notice. This can translate into a ballooning debt payment that becomes unmanageable.
Essays are gaining importance as a way to judge potential, and essays largely have replaced personal interviews. Writing an email may be easy, but rewriting a serious college admissions essay is much more challenging. Rewrite your application essay as many times as you feel is needed, and have people that you trust read it. Essays as well as letters of recommendation should emphasize personal development, demonstrate intellectual curiosity, and show concern for the community. In order to complete the admissions essay program, California Baptist University computer graphics information may be used in order to fulfill computing breadth requirements.
The admissions essay topic should be something the applicant cares about, and which shows how you've helped others to enjoy greater success. The best essay topics are like a short story, with poignant details, in which the writer shows by example. There should be no grammar errors or punctuation mistakes in your college essay, and even if the college application says that the essay is optional, you should treat it as an admission requirement. Alternatively, focusing on business study via Garrett College tax credit program, for example, can help you find a rewarding position in corporate consulting services.
Technical programs are a low-cost alternative to attending a regular four-year university, and you can earn good money as a highly-skilled, technical specialist. By remaining true to your career interests, your overall job earnings will increase as you gain experience.

Massive open online courses are known as MOOCs, utilizing interactive platforms such as Blackboard, and mobile apps. For example, Khan Academy now offers free lecture videos served through YouTube.

This is one of the ideal articles I have read relating to blindness in dogs and changing the environment for your dog. Very first of all i dont have pancreatitis, but my brother does, he has been dealing with this illness for over 3 years now and he stays in and out of the hospital due to so a lot discomfort that pancreatitis causes. The rose is a single of his flowers, and I handmade and painted the paper bead necklace for him. We weren’t sure what good quality of life a blind/nearly deaf dog would have, and we believed of placing him down.
Even so making use of bus service in Leh Ladakh means that your schedule may well get a bit hectic due to limited connectivity of far-flung destinations that entail extended hours of drive on rocky mountainous terrains and crossing several high altitude passes. But blindness in dogs and cats is not the identical as in humans. You can obtain a Frontier Airlines ticket anywhere you like and then redeem your miles for it. The only condition is that your ticket ought to be bought with the Venture card.
The last petrol pump that you are going to locate on this route is positioned at Tandi and the next a single is at Karu which is around 380 kms away. About 25 years ago, when I found my adore for designing and creating beaded jewelry, I started collecting vintage glass beads, vintage Swarovski crystal beads, vintage brass filigrees and jewelry findings, and some quite special and uncommon lampwork glass beads and fused glass pendants created by talented glass artists. From Manali onwards, i have heard April is not the ideal time to go through Manali-Leh route.
Let small rabbits be blessed – and this lens also! Yet another large area of public space is Buffalo Park, with a stunning view of the San Francisco Peaks, a two-mile loop trail for walkers, runners, and bikers, with fitness stations along the way, picnic places, and access to a network of backcountry trails that lead into and about the peaks. But they turned out to be excellent for storing both large beads and massive quantities of beads in a single color family. It would aid if I know when are you traveling because Manali side gets rougher as the season progresses September is risky and October is riskier nonetheless.

RESOLUT, a project to recreate the nuclear reactions in exploding stars, is in its final stages of preparation at FSU's Superconducting Linear Accelerator Laboratory and will be instrumental in furthering astrophysics research worldwide.
"We are bringing the stars into the basement and studying them," said Ingo Wiedenhover, an assistant professor of physics who is heading up the project. The accelerator laboratory is located underground in FSU's LeRoy Collins Research Laboratory.
RESOLUT is designed to recreate atomic nuclei that are believed to be the fuel of star explosions and may exist for only thousandths of a second before they disintegrate. Through a two-stage process the nuclei will be created in the accelerator and their properties measured before disintegrating.
These ions are so exotic and short lived that they cannot form under natural conditions on Earth, they can only be created in the accelerator, Wiedenhover said. RESOLUT will allow scientists for the first time to study and measure these nuclei to further an understanding of how stars are created and die.
"If you cannot study these nuclei in a microsecond, they're gone," Wiedenhover said, "and RESOLUT will allow us to study them."
Among other things, the experiments with RESOLUT will help scientists worldwide to interpret data collected by a satellite launched from Kazakhstan in 2002 to study some of the most violent and exotic objects in the universe, such as black holes and neutron stars. The satellite, or International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory, is part of an international astrophysics consortium headed by the European Space Agency.
FSU's accelerator operates by firing a continuous beam of atomic nuclei through a slender steel tube reaching speeds of about 60 million miles per hour, or 10 percent the speed of light. At such speeds the nuclei will induce reactions when they collide into other nuclei contained in thin foils called the "target," which are located at the end of the beam path. The collisions rip apart the nuclei into their various components, which are then detected and analyzed in a variety of research instruments.
The accelerator is used in various types of nuclear physics research, including measuring gamma rays emitted from spinning nuclei and other reactions of these nuclei as they collide. The biggest discovery made using FSU's accelerator resulted from experiments of so-called isobaric analog-states, which are states of nuclei in which a proton behaves as if it were a neutron, or vice versa. This project established that protons and neutrons can be understood as two separate states of the same particle even as they bind together creating the core of an atom.
The accelerator began operations in 1960 and has maintained its state of the art status through two major upgrades, the first in 1970 and the second in 1985. RESOLUT is the lab's latest upgrade opening new research possibilities for a new generation of physicists and students.

ARYAN MEMORY: MUSICAL TRADITIONS IN PAMIR (2CD + DVD + BOOK) - Kailas Records / Dolina Bartanga (Russia), 2007
New album of Theodor Bastard. The title refers to an ancient Greek notion, designating the inhabited or "civilized" sections of our planet, in other words those where mankind has left its mark - for better or worse. That global sweep is certainly echoed in the list of contributors, since our Russian artists are joined here by representatives of British, Zulu, Indian, and French-African traditions. Consequently, the list of instruments employed - and their home nations - is even longer. >>
Coming 11 years after IRON, which also tackled the sound of rock with alarming results, the new album features not only recent guitar tracks recorded at Music Research Centre at York University, but also recordings made during Soviet era Russia, which refer to Pavlov's underground music activities in the early 80-ies. IIRON is a powerful, well executed electronic rock record, with just a dash a humour to keep it from becoming pompous, as so much of that kind of music can be sometimes. >>

Long-awaited, CD the version, one of the most interesting albums of Italian master Massimo Magrini! First time Transponder was released as CD-R on Blade Records in 99, now the album is again accessible, in a new format and with additional, exclusive compositions of that period - "Yst" and "Waal"! More than 60 minutes dark, deep, meditative, structured noise-ambient, in the best traditions of "Dolmen Factory" and "Ampos". >>
The reissue of a long-deleted classic album by this legendary Belgian project. It was created especially for the 150th anniversary of the Antwerp Zoo. Music composed by Sandy and Hermann (of Ah-Cama Sotz) was woven in between the sounds of dolphins, killer whales and the noise of the underwater world. The Zoo director wrote the following in the preface: "Soundtrack For The Antwerp Zoo Aquarium" is a musical journey of the similar stature as "20 000 Leagues Under the Sea" by Julius Verne. >>
"Returnal" is the 4th album from Daniel Lopatin's Oneohtrix Point Never project, after "Betrayed In The Octagon" (Deception Island, 2007), "Zones Without People" (Arbor, 2009) and "Russian Mind" (No Fun, 2009). All 3 albums being superbly compiled on the "Rifts" double CD set (No Fun, 2009). It sees Lopatin fine tune his craft for creation of deep atmospheres and texture even further. >>

There are some differences in anion composition, but all have chloride as a major anionic constituent, the balance in Hartmann’s or Plasma-Lyte being made up with lactate or acetate, respectively. Both lactate and acetate are ultimately metabolized to bicarbonate in the liver, thus producing a near ideal physiological solution. Hartmann’s solution is the most commonly used crystalloid in priming fluids in the UK, although there is variation in practice amongst different units. Normosol-A and Plasma-Lyte are balanced solutions more commonly used in the USA.
I was starting to wonder if he had it in him to stand up to the Republicans on anything and by announcing yesterday that HE'S HAD ENOUGH and declaring the meeting over during the Debt ceiling talks he earned his respect.

As an Arab-Australian it's difficult to watch the events in Syria, Iraq and Gaza without a sense of guilt and shame. To outside eyes, it must appear that the Middle East is driven by hatred and bloodlust. In fact there is a long history of persecuted members of one Middle Eastern faith finding safety in the places of worship of those that are often cast as their enemies. This is the Middle East, at once unconscionably cruel and unbearably kind.
I am a grandmother of six, a practising Catholic and for some years was our local Catholic youth group mum. I was drawn to protest actions because other ways of protecting the future for my grandchildren were proving fruitless. Having stayed with the protesters and seen them in action, I have been impressed with their disciplined dedication to an ethic of peaceful non-violence. It is not 'violence' to frustrate mine workers and annoy the police.
Imagine how the quality of the debate would improve if those who blamed the victims of poverty and illness for their plight were publicly labelled welfare sceptics or denialists, and forced to back up their claims. Social research academics would be thrust into the spotlight. If this issue received the scrutiny it deserves in the media there would be a sea change in attitudes to poverty, unemployment and income support over time.
This week in the Wall Street Journal, Thane Rosenbaum argued that Palestinian adults are, as a whole, legitimate targets of attack because they were involved in electing Hamas to power eight years ago. There is no need for more blood or tears in Gaza, but there is a strong case to be made for higher ethical standards. Based on the manner in which it is presently being conducted, this war is unjust on both sides.
There's something satisfying about subverting society's idea of what constitutes beautiful: female-led campaigns that flood the media with images of representative faces and bodies reinforce the absurdity of current 'beauty' standards. But this isn't really liberating. No longer is it only the physically exquisite who can pose naked; the plain and the imperfect must be welcomed, too, into the sacred circle of female objectification.
There are efficiencies in the fictions of right. The glee, that honest toil of looting other lives. Each tumble clears the view, just a bit. Years are nothing, what's rebuilt doesn't work — just as effortlessly as the dirty little system before that so many died to defend. But don't worry, time is a grader. Alongside the quacking of historians all mistakes will be buried under new initiatives.
This week's inauguration of Twiggy Forrest's Global Freedom Network — a large-scale interfaith initiative to end slavery — publicly recognises the importance of interfaith collaboration as a means of understanding and addressing social issues. Its launch comes not long after an Australian-first interfaith forum about the issue of forced marriage. It included Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and Jews, and discovered that forced marriage is not a Muslim issue.
The PM's poker face flickers like a faulty switch, he comes across as dense or kitsch when he obfuscates and dickers ...

The broad support Francis receives from progressives, despite his unwillingness to even consider female ordination, demonstrates how marginalised women's issues really are in our society. He may have changed the game in terms of the Church's engagement with the poor, but this does not diminish the significance of his oppressive and outdated views on gender roles.
'The market for disability services will need to be underpinned with a strong and robust internal risk management framework. There will be an increasing number of for-profit operators in the sector. Hopefully the not-for-profit operators will make the necessary adaptations competing in the market and providing the ethos for the market to deliver services in a dignified, fair and transparent manner.' Frank Brennan's Leading the Way Seminar for the National Disability Service
At a certain point, emotional and mental overstimulation leads to a sort of emotional numbness, as the brain and central nervous system can only respond to so much. With enough dopamine hits from 'likes' on Facebook, and adrenalin spikes from sensationalised news stories, one's emotions can become blunted. That is, with the notable exception of general irritability borne of expecting one's real life to be as fast-paced as one's online one.
Social media requires us to produce 'profiles' of ourselves that represent our cultural aspirations; not only who we are, but who we imagine we would like to be. This is often liberating and creative. But the digital sphere is not as innocent as mere self-expression. The more we believe that we are inherently self-made, essential beings, our capacity to recognise the cultural and economic forces greater than us suffers.

'Barefoot Bandit' gets more than 7 years for spree [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive]
SEATTLE -- Colton Harris-Moore, the "Barefoot Bandit," was sentenced Friday to more than seven years in prison after pleading guilty to dozens of state charges.
The 20-year-old man gained international notoriety while evading police across the country in stolen planes, boats and cars during a two-year crime spree.
Judge Vickie Churchill said "this case is a tragedy in many ways, but it's a triumph of the human spirit in other ways." She described Harris-Moore's upbringing as a "mind numbing absence of hope," and believed he was genuinely remorseful and contrite.
Friday's proceedings consolidated cases against Harris-Moore in three Washington counties. He has already pleaded guilty to federal charges in Seattle and will be sentenced for those crimes early next year. He will serve his state and federal sentences at the same time.
Wearing handcuffs and an orange jail uniform, Colton Harris-Moore spoke softly in court while entering his pleas and sat next to his attorneys with his eyes downcast, looking even younger than his 20 years.
In a statement provided to Judge Vickie Churchill, he said his childhood was one he wouldn't wish on his "darkest enemies."
Still, he said he takes responsibility for the crime spree that brought him international notoriety.
Harris-Moore said he studied manuals and online videos to teach himself to be a pilot, and the thrills he experienced while flying stolen planes renewed his passion for life and will help him rehabilitate while in prison.
"The euphoria of the countdown to takeoff and the realization of a dream was nearly blinding," he said of his first illicit flight on Nov. 11, 2008. "My first thought after takeoff was 'Oh my God, I'm flying.' I had waited my entire life for that moment."
He said he'll use his prison time to study and get ready to apply to college, with the hope of earning an aeronautical engineering degree.
Several victims and a few curious citizens watched Harris-Moore enter his pleas in Island County Superior Court, along with Harris-Moore's aunt.
"He was a menace," Island County Prosecutor Greg Banks told the court. "His burglaries threatened and distressed people. People were afraid to leave their houses."
He pleaded guilty to a total of 16 counts from Island County, including identity theft, theft of firearm and residential burglary. Then the hearing continued with Harris-Moore pleading guilty to 17 counts from San Juan County.
Harris-Moore's daring run from the law earned him international fame and a movie deal to help repay his victims after he flew a stolen plane from Indiana to the Bahamas in July 2010, crash-landed it near a mangrove swamp and was arrested by Bahamian authorities in a hail of bullets.
State prosecutors asked for a nine-and-a-half year sentence. Browne and attorney Emma Scanlan, sought a low-end, six-year term, citing Harris-Moore's bleak childhood in a Camano Island trailer with an alcoholic mother and a series of her convict boyfriends. They laid out the details of his upbringing in psychiatric and mitigation reports filed with the court.
Harris-Moore's first conviction came at age 12, in 2004, for possession of stolen property, and according to the reports, his first experience with burglary came when he broke into the homes of his classmates to steal food because his mother spent most of her Social Security income on beer and cigarettes -- something she has denied.
Over the next three years he was convicted of theft, burglary, malicious mischief and assault, among other crimes. At one point he was arrested when a detective posed as a pizza-delivery driver.
In 2007, the boy was sentenced to three years in a juvenile lockup after pleading guilty to three burglary counts in Island County. But he fled the minimum-security facility in April 2008 and was soon back to his old tricks, breaking into unoccupied vacation homes, stealing food and sometimes staying there.
As red-faced investigators repeatedly failed to catch him, his antics escalated: He began stealing planes from small, rural airports and crash-landing them -- at least five in all.
"What was characterized by the media as the swashbuckling adventures of a rakish teenager were in fact the actions of a depressed, possibly suicidal young man with waxing and waning post-traumatic stress disorder (following his first plane crash in November 2008)," wrote Dr. Richard S. Adler, a psychiatrist who evaluated him for the defense lawyers.
Waves of burglaries broke out on Orcas Island, where Kyle Ater runs his Homegrown Market and Deli, in late 2009 and in early 2010, after stolen planes were found at the airport there. The second time, Harris-Moore left Ater's new security system in a utility sink, under a running faucet. He took cash and a tray of croissants, and Ater's insurance company jacked up his rates.
Mike Parnell, a former owner of the Oakley sunglasses company who lives on Orcas, was repeatedly victimized. Harris-Moore hid out for long periods in the second level of his hangar at the airport, and when Parnell and his family would go on trips in their plane, Harris-Moore would take their car to their house and eat their food. At one point, Harris-Moore entered their home while Parnell was there with his wife and three children and grabbed his wife's car keys off a counter.
"We were all fearing for our lives," Parnell said Thursday. "The kids wouldn't sleep in their own bedrooms. We purchased night vision goggles. I'm glad that day is finally approaching when we will finally know what the consequences are, and I hope it's sufficient for the way our whole island suffered."
Harris-Moore's final spree came after he stole a pistol in eastern British Columbia and took a plane from a hangar in Idaho, where investigators found bare footprints on the floor and wall. That plane crashed near Granite Falls, Wash., after it ran out of fuel.
He made his way to Oregon in a 32-foot boat stolen in southwestern Washington -- stopping first to leave $100 at an animal shelter in Raymond, Wash. From Oregon, authorities said, Harris-Moore traveled across the United States, frequently stealing cars from the parking lots of small airports. In Indiana, he stole another plane and made for the Bahamas, more than 1,000 miles away, where authorities finally caught him in a manhunt that spanned multiple islands.
Among the courtroom spectators Friday were 18-year-olds Annie Cain and Hayley Hanna, who drove from nearby Langley to be at the courthouse at 5:30 a.m. -- four hours before the hearing.
"We wanted to be here just because he's so young, and everything he did, it's fascinating," Cain said.
"This man is a serial burglar," San Juan County Prosecutor Randall Gaylord told The Associated Press. "I'm glad he's going to be held accountable, and I'm really glad he's taking responsibility for these things. I hope he gets through this chapter in his life, is resilient and is able to move on."

The good folks at the Arizona Community Action Association have invited all members of the Arizona Legislature to spend an afternoon being poor.
You'd think our politicians would jump at the chance, having proven themselves to be poor policy makers, poor communicators, poor problem-solvers and poor role models.
In this instance, however, the association simply wants them to be ... poor. Like the nearly 20 percent of Arizona families estimated to live below the poverty level. Like the one in three Arizona citizens classified as "working poor."
The ACAA plans to hold a "poverty simulation" May 10 in which volunteers will participate in a role-playing exercise that allows them to experience what it's like to struggle each day to provide their families with food, shelter and other basic necessities.
"We have heard from a few who thanked us for the invitation, a couple of whom have said that they have a conflict from a calendar perspective," she said. "That's about it."
The ACAA's website notes that "Arizona ranks 50th in the nation in combined state and local spending on social and human services."
"This is the first time our association has done a simulation," Zwick told me. "We find that you don't know what it's like for a struggling family until you are out looking for benefits, looking for child care, trying to balance your job with the demands or just struggling to make it through the day economically. It can be quite eye-opening."
"Most of the families we work with have some employment," Zwick said. "But it's a day-to-day struggle. How do we pay the utility bill? Can we put gas in the car? Is there money for rent?
"With the senior population what we hear is that many of our seniors are making choices each day between food and medication."
For many people living here there is no such thing as a luxury. If anything, necessities are luxuries.
'There is no health-care coverage for most of the jobs these people have," Zwick said. "If someone gets sick that is it. That will financially ruin them. A number of the families we've seen were hit hard by the recession. They lost jobs, blew through their savings, lost their health-care insurance. Same with dental care, which is even more difficult to get and can lead to all kinds of other health issues."
"We have to approach the issues faced by these families in a holistic way rather than simply plugging holes with every crisis," Zwick said. "It would benefit leaders to see the complexity of the problem from a human perspective. When budgets get tight it becomes easy to hide behind the statistics. People aren't statistics, however.
"When the decisions get more difficult it's easy to look at the numbers and ignore the human impact. We think it's good to be reminded now and then about the humans behind the numbers."
In The Third Man, one of the best movies of all time, a villainous character played by Orson Welles is at the top of a Ferris wheel with his one-time friend, played by Joseph Cotten, who has found out that Welles is selling watered-down medicine, callously putting profit over people. It's one of those movie scenes that transcends the film and describes the greater human condition, then and now.
"You know, I never feel comfortable on these sort of things," Welles says. "Victims? Don't be melodramatic. Look down there. Tell me. Would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever?"

Spix’s Macaw (Cy anopsitta spixii), also known as the Little Blue Macaw, is a Brazilian macaw and the only small blue macaw. It is a member of Arini tribe in the subfamily Arinae (Neotropical parrots), part of the family Psittacidae (the true parrots). It was first described by German naturalist Georg Marcgrave, when he was working in the State of Pernambuco, Brazil in 1638 and it is named for German naturalist Johann Baptist von Spix, who collected a specimen in 1819 on the bank of the Rio São Francisco in northeast Bahia in Brazil.
The Hawaiian Crow or ʻAlalā (Corvus hawaiiensis) is a species of bird in the crow family, Corvidae. It is about the size of the Carrion Crow at48–50 centimeters (19–20 in) in length, but with more rounded wings and a much thicker bill. It has soft, brownish-black plumage and long, bristly throat feathers; the feet, legs and bill are black. SomeNative Hawaiians consider the Hawaiian Crow an ʻaumakua (family god).
The Kakapo, also called owl parrot, is a species of large, flightless, nocturnal, ground dwelling parrots of the super-family Strigopoidea endemic to New Zealand. It has finely blotched yellow-green plumage, a distinct facial disc of sensory, vibrissa-like feathers, a large grey beak, short legs, large feet, and wings and a tail of relatively short length. It is also possibly one of the world’s longest-living birds. Like many other New Zealand bird species, the Kakapo was historicallyimportant to the Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, appearing in many of their traditional legends and folklore.
The Brazilian Merganser, Mergus octosetaceus, is a duck in the typical merganser genus. It is one of the six most threatened waterfowlin the world with possibly fewer than 250 birds in the wild and none kept in captivity. The origin of its name is from its long, sharp-edged beak that has a great number of teeth-looking edges.
The California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus) is a New World vulture, the largest North American land bird. This condor became extinct in the wild in 1987 (all remaining wild individuals were captured) but has been reintroduced to northern Arizona and southern Utah (including the Grand Canyon area and Zion National Park), coastal mountains of central and southern California, and northern Baja California. Although other fossil members are known, it is the only surviving member of the genus Gymnogyps.
It was pretty chilly at 7.15 when I arrived at the Fen today, so - given the admonishments I received from my doctor about not getting too cold for too long - it was never going to be a long session. In the event, Brian T didn't arrive until after 7.45, but we enjoyed catching up and chatting with Chris, another SF regular.
Not much in the way of birdlife today, although squabbling Marsh Harriers, Greylags and Coots were amusing to watch. Lots of Chinese Water Deer were roaming around, including this very-pregnant female. Other mammal interest came in the form of a youngish Red Fox that, sadly, never came close enough for decent photography.
Since I was out and about, I thought I'd whizz east to Gt Yarmouth for a look at the harbour mouth. I'm confident I did see the reported Glaucous Gull, but it flew over me towards the new Outer Harbour before I had the camera ready.
I drove past the Marina Centre (half a dozen Mediterranean Gulls flying around) and continued home via Mautby. No sign of the Hooded Crow, but the Iceland Gull was still distantly viewable, as were lots more Med Gulls. A minor murmuration of Starlings was interesting to watch.
As I pulled onto my driveway at home I noticed a Buzzard drifting west over Pedham: I pointed it out to my neighbour Sue (and her window cleaners!) Amazingly, while we were talking at least another ten followed it!
(Just been looking through the gull shots from the harbour mouth: one distant bird - through two wire-mesh fences - looks a bit glaucousy: as always, informed opinion welcome. And yes, it has been 'de-noised' with PSP)
Since I no longer play in a band and rarely jam at the local club, I needed another guitar like a fish needs an aqualung!
However, Linda and I popped into Norwich early today and I spotted a delightful Fender electro-acoustic in a second hand shop (it's the one on the left with the electric-style neck and machine heads.)
We walked all around Norwich before Linda persuaded me to return to the shop and add it to my Fender family: no second invitation required! I've been bashing away at it through my Roland Cube and it plays - and sounds - a treat!
Linda and I have lived in our bungalow on the Heath for nearly 20 years: we have a medium-sized garden with arable farmland on two sides. As a result, most of the birds on our garden list have been flyovers or farmland birds: imagine my surprise, then, when I looked from the office window to see a Moorhen swimming in our tiny pond!
He hung around for half an hour, alternating between eating worms on the lawn and swimming in the pond: a very pleasant surprise! While I was copying over the images from my SD card, a male Merlin flew across the garden - great to see, but frustrating because the card was not in the camera!
Blustery weather, but it hasn't put off the local birds of prey: this morning I glanced from the office to see a Buzzard battling against the strong winds. This doesn't seem to be one of the 'regulars', lacking their characteristic colouration.
A little later a beautiful female Marsh Harrier drifted along our hedge line: the closest I've seen one here for a while. Meanwhile, numerous female Pheasants and a pair of Red-legged Partridges came for an early breakfast!
Norman and I spent a couple of hours at Strumpshaw (early start, as is always essential) and were rewarded by views of nearly everything you'd expect to see at this time of year.
The walk to Fen Hide produced three 'Teddy Bears' (Water Deer!) - we were to see at least three more before we left the reserve. Once settled in the hide, we were 'serenaded' by Water Rails: only brief glimpses, unfortunately. This was also the case with the pair of Kingfishers that alighted on the furthest post, but at least we managed a few photos. An Otter torpedoed along the channel, scaring the waterfowl without surrendering to the camera.
The walk along the riverbank to Tower Hide was enlivened by repeated glimpses of a pair of Bullfinches and the odd Cetti's Warbler: we were pleasantly surprised that the paths were comparatively firm and dry.
In front of Tower Hide, four Snipe lounged in the sunlight, occasionally being pushed off by Greylags. A third Kingfisher allowed silhouette views as it perched very briefly on the 'fish refuge' sticks. Last two birds of note were a distant Bittern, a Marsh Harrier dragging a large twig to its chosen nest site, and another with a white wing tag.
Following a parcel run to the post office, I thought I'd take advantage of the morning sunshine for a quick whizz along the Yare Valley. Following brief (and unproductive) stops at the usual sites, I spent half an hour at Halvergate: no raptors or owls, just a very confiding Little Egret. The drive into Yarmouth produced 200 - 300 Pinkfeet right by the road, a mile past the 'Stracey Arms': not many left now!
I carried on through Caister to Mautby, where, pulling over to let a car by, I realised it was being driven by Barry Jarvis. He hadn't seen anything of interest, but I decided to spend an hour by the pigfields anyway. I parked behind a couple of nice guys from Thetford: we swapped tales and reminisced about birds we'd seen and places we'd visited, before they moved off to look for the Burgh Castle Beans. I stuck it out and - eventually - lots of gulls dropped in, including the Iceland and a few Meds. One of the Hooded /Carrion Crow hybrids put in a brief (and distant) appearance, as did a few Buzzards. And so home to do some office work.
Although the watch-point won't be active until next month and the video feed isn't live yet, Linda and I thought we'd pop into Norwich to see if the Peregrines were back on the steeple yet: they were!
From as far away as Tombland we could see the female perched on a piece of masonry, while a walk round the Close revealed that the male (?) was on the nest tray. At times he hopped up onto the video camera for a better scan of the area! The female flew off eastwards at 10.45, so we adjourned to the Refectory for coffee and a scone: there's a terrific view of the nesting tray from here, although the windows are a bit grimy for photography.
As we walked back to the car, the sun appeared from behind the clouds, allowing a lower ISO and slightly better photos (given that the birds are atop a 300+ foot spire!)
I've been looking at birds for fifty years: I used to twitch, but stopped when I'd seen 400 UK species. (Back in the 80's, I was part of a four-person team that won the national 24-hour birdrace three times!) I'm 'on' 430-odd now (UK 400) I tend to concentrate on wildlife within ten miles of my front door these days!
I am the UK's only full time professional meteorite dealer and have had the pleasure of enjoying dinner/drinks with almost all of the surviving Apollo astronauts!
I originally started drawing a portrait of Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia on the anniversary of her passing. However, it didn’t really look like her at all, so I abandoned it and created another image. Ten days later I decided to give it another go, where I also decided to experiment with different Procreate brushes and such. This image is a reminder that sometimes it’s best to leave something for a little while and pick it up again later. Seeing something with fresh eyes can really help move a project forwards.

What would any afternoon tea be without traditional scones? These buttery little treats are so easy and quick to make, they’re a real delight. Just make sure to be gentle with the dough! Knead the dough like a bread or pizza dough and you’re doomed. You will want these scones to be lights and crumbly, so leave the frustration kneading for another dough that requires some tough love.

Random is a funny thing. Some weeks I think I have none to share, and before I know it, I have a very full post! So here we go!
I rolled the binding for "Sunshiney Day" on an empty Aurifil spool and voila! For once I didn't have binding wrapped around my ankles as I sewed it on! It helped keep the process nice and neat and I'll definitely be doing this again.
Jennie from zipit shared a very informative "Guide to Zippers" on sew mama sew this week - worth a read.
Then it was kind of deja vu with Stephanie from Spontaneous Threads who is using her left-over 2.5" Polaroid centers and changing up the Economy Block dimensions to suit. Basically, that's what I'm doing if I ever get back to them. Great minds think alike!
There was more deja vu when I spied the pillow jerigirltx had made for her guild's low-volume challenge. Love that it was inspired by Common Affection, which used Little Miss Shabby's Hugs & Kisses block.
I'm loving keeping tabs on the City Sampler linky over at Sew Sweetness. As of this writing, there are 13 quilts linked up using several different layouts. SO cool! Can hardly believe my top is done and "turned in" so to speak!
There are two new sew-alongs that have started up . . . Vice Versa BOM and Vintage Quilt Revival. Is anyone joining in? I hope at least to try a few blocks from each. Both look terrific!
Are you following the True Colors Blog Tour? I'm really enjoying seeing the projects being made with these lovely fabrics. Do you have a favorite?
Lastly, did you see the cool shout-out in last week's sew mama sew blog highlights email (January 16)? Let's just say that little tidbit brought some new activity to the A Quilter's Table facebook page. Fun times.
You're so good at being in the loop. Love the picture of the binding. I remember the days of getting tangled in the fishing line, ha ha, nice to know I've grown out of some challenges.
It's interesting, I see so many people sewing their binding on as they go, but I've always been a pin-the-whole-thing-down and perfect the corners before starting to sew the binding on kind of person. Curious if I'm the only one out there who does it this way!!
Love the binding shot! It is just so beautiful and such a great idea for keeping your binding off the ground!
Is it weird that I kind of like the binding wrapped round everything? It gives me a better idea of whether or not I'm nearly done lol
You are one busy lady Deb! It's always so fun to read what you are up to {and in to!} Thanks for the bits of random fun!
How did you keep your binding so perfectly rolled on the spool? I am enjoying your series and the True Color one too. Wish I could afford to buy them all.
I had a great day and it started with your reply about my City Sampler! :-) thank you for that! ...and random is good, especially on Thirsdays :-))
I tried this trick a couple days ago and it worked like a charm! You were definitely my motivating factor in finishing up my City Sampler. Good luck:)
Learning how to draw cartoon animals from the farm is not such a difficult task! Weve grown up surrounded by them! Farm animals are everywhere: In blockbuster movies, childs books, greeting cards. their shapes and images are printed in our minds! In this section, I will show you how to determine what are the physical uniqueness of each animal and how to work with them. Then, you can practice drawing each cartoon character using basic shapes. You will have the opportunity to make nice illustrations, practice sketching and cartooning using short easy lessons and complete your creation using a drawing software to create vector art if you want to! Cartoon drawing is really fun once you get into it!
Dont be afraid to try until you get it right. This method is really simple, but requires practice and observation. So, sit back and relax. Learn how to draw animals from the farm and start your journey on a good note! Lets try s few basic characters to get started! :) A cute turkey to begin with. In this first tutorial, you can learn how to draw a fun turkey mostly made from small rectangles and large circular shapes. The posture of the character is really interesting. Not only is it easier to draw than a front version, but its also easier to add some perspective (as we can see with the legs). The fact that we just need to draw one wing is also interesting. Most of these cartoon animals are not filled with complex textures or digital effects. In this case, the subject is filled with plain colors and only a few basic details (inside the tail) were added. A nice turtle also from a side view.

Ettore Messina will remain on the CSKA Moscow bench for at least another season after club and coach announced their agreement Sunday on a new contract. CSKA's announcement of the agreement came hours before before playing the 2008 Euroleague Final against Maccabi Tel Aviv. CSKA re-signed Messina for next season with an option for the 2009-10 season as well, the club said. Messina is completing his third season with the club, having reached the Euroleague Final in all three. He and CSKA won the Euroleague title in their first season together, 2006. They were runners-up by two points in last season's title game. At the time of Sunday's announcement, CSKA was prepared to play another final that, if successful, will make the club the second most successful in the highest competition in European competition. Messina had previously coached Virtus Bologna to two Euroleague titles, in 1998 and 2001, and took Benetton Treviso to the Final Four in 2003. Messina also coached the Italian national team.

Our next destination would be Macau located about an hour away by modern hydrofoil boats. Both Hong Kong and Macau were settled by westerners seeking to establish trade with China but, unlike Hong Kong which was settled by the British, Macau is a Portuguese territory. As a result, the cultures are very different. On Macau our home for our short three-day stay would be the Westin Resort Macau located on Collone Island, a twenty-five minute ride from downtown Macau. The hotel was isolated but absolutely beautiful.
Macau's history is long dating to 1557 when the Portuguese settled the area. It has suffered ups and downs over the centuries and alternated between being important and non-important to the region. When Hong Kong was settled in 1841 and became the major port in the South China Seas, Macau was relegated into obscurity. Today Macau has much to offer the tourists. In a small area you can find a 16th century Buddhist temples, a 17th century European style fort, and an 18th century baroque church. Combine those with modern skyscrapers and colonial mansions and you have a city with unique character and excitement. Add to that a touch of gambling and you're got a major destination Hong Kong citizens to frequent. Another major attraction for tourists is its proximity to mainland China. One day trips to the Peoples Republic of China can be easily arranged to give you an insight to what life is like in China today.
Monte Hill is the heart of Macau's tourist area today. On it you will find an old fort and some magnificent views of Macau and China in the distance. Built by the Jesuits the area includes the fort, a college, and the church of the Mother of God, commonly known as St. Paul's. St. Paul's was once described as the most beautiful church in southeast Asia. It was designed by an Italian Jesuit in the early 16th century and built with the assistance of Japanese Christian artisans who had fled from feudal persecution in Nagasaki. Only the facade of St. Paul's remains today for tourists to imagine its once beauty. In 1835 at the height of a major typhoon the church caught fire and burned to the ground leaving only the facade and a staircase. Today it is a symbol of Macau and recognized worldwide.
What a meal! There's just no other way to describe it. It was fantastic. Thank you Ken! Ken, on a previous visit to Macau, found Henri's several years before and wanted to go back for another meal. He'd described it as "out of this world," and we, too, were looking forward to the experience. And, thankfully, we weren't disappointed. It was without a doubt the best meal of the entire trip.
We sat down and basically told Henri to "bring food." He asked a few qualifying questions and then served our meal. It was outlandish and extravagant, but it was certainly worth it. Henri brought African chicken, a meat dish, curried crabs and spicy prawns. When we finished we ordered more of the curried crab as it was out of this world.
My only disappointment would happen long after we returned home. We had one of our gourmet weekends with Ken and Darla and Jim and Cheryl coming to our house. Anne and I decided to recreate the meal at Henri's. I had found recipes for everything except the curried crab. Frustrated at not finding the recipe I wrote Henri a letter requesting the recipe. Along with the letter I sent the picture that we took with him when we were there in the hopes that he might remember us and provide the recipe. No luck. I had to improvise and substitute another recipe (which, by the way, wasn't the same but it wasn't bad!). So, Henri, if you ever read this know that I was disappointed that you wouldn't provide the recipe.

The copper belt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia yields most of the cobalt mined worldwide. The United States uses about one-third of total world consumption.

HSP can also stand for Humanitarian Settlement Program, It’s administered by the Australian government Department of Social Services, or DSS.
When new refugee migrants first arrive in Australia, they encounter one of the most challenging and difficult periods in their lives, where they have little to no financial resources, often limited English language skills, or knowledge of the culture, laws and customs of their new adopted home, Australia.
They need to navigate their way though a bewildering maze of hoops to jump through in order to become integrated and productive in their new environment, much of which everyday, established Australians see as commonplace, and take for granted; starting with successfully accessing financial support, finding a place to live, educating themselves, and finding a job. On top of this, they still bear the scars and trauma of atrocities and hardships that may have occurred in their country of origin, and in many cases, along the journey toward Australia.
Such new migrant arrivals benefit greatly from assistance and support delivered by organizations who assist their initial transition.
Ballarat first became a region of settlement as part of a pilot program involving immigrants from the African nation of Togolese ; which had mixed success came under heavy criticism for poor planning initially, mainly through a paper written by an academic
However, anecdotal commentary from some participants at the time indicated extremely positive outcomes, gratefulness generally for having escaped the horrors and hardships of life in refugee camps.

﻿ Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst | GameGuías – Guías y Trucos de Video juegos, Preguntas de Video juegos
Tobias Moskowitz and Jon Wertheim have written a book for sports fans that, as its subtitle says, explores “the hidden influences behind how sports are played and games are won.” Scorecasting does pretty much deliver the goods, but some of what is revealed is at times a bit underwhelming since common sense and careful observation tell much the same story without all the stats.
There is something in the book for fans of both professional and amateur sports - and everything in between, such as our semi-professional college sports programs. The authors take a hard look at football, baseball, basketball, hockey, golf, and soccer and use statistics, personal observation, interviews, and speculation to make surprising points concerning what is really happening out there.
I suspect that most fans will be least surprised by the book when it comes to whatever sport they spend the most time following. In my case, that sport is baseball. While the authors spend a substantial number of pages explaining what goes on in the head of a major league umpire when the game is being played in a loud and hostile ballpark, little about “makeup calls” and special treatment for star players, especially in late innings or in crucial situations, will surprise baseball nuts.
The chapter on the use of steroids in baseball did, however, give me something new to think about. Ever wonder why most of the players caught using steroids are minority players from poor countries? Moskowitz and Wertheim will fill you in.
There are chapters on home field advantage, the relative value of blocked shots in basketball, the situational pressure of putting, the “myth” of the hot hand and momentum, icing the field goal kicker in game situations, why early draft choices are so overvalued and, among a few others, whether or not defense really wins championships.
There really is something here for everyone, regardless of how rabid a sports fan one might be, and there are some surprises and observational gems to be found. If you enjoyed Freakonomics or SuperFreakonomics, the odds are pretty high that you will love this one. If you hated those two books and dislike sports, run away from Scorecasting.
Just remember, sports fans, as one of the book’s chapter titles puts it, “There’s no I in team, but there is an “m” and an “e.” Or as Michael Jordon once said when a team owner chastised him by using the “there’s no I in team,” thing, “There’s an I in win. So which way do you want it?”
This one will make you chuckle a bit while it presents you with a new way to look at something you’ve been watching your entire life. It might even make you feel a little smarter because you already knew some of this stuff.
Oh, my husband will like this one, I think. He loves to watch them, and is curious about how they work, especially North American ones - he is trying to learn American football at the moment. Thanks for this review, I'll look out for this one!
Susan, the book doesn't so much explain the rules of the game as it gets inside the heads of the players, coaches, and umpires to explain their strategies and play-calling. Your husband would probably be especially interested in the chapters on soccer.

Oak bookcases may be seen as a luxury, but they do add a lot of character to any room. Not only that, but their natural warmth and texture makes a perfect backdrop for displaying books. They are a very adaptable item of furniture and are suitable whether you want to show off your latest buys in the living room, or keep them safely stacked in a bedroom. Oak is a hardwood so is an excellent choice if you want a durable piece of furniture. And if it is made from solid wood, an oak bookcase would make a stylish addition to any room. Oak is tough and resists scratches but you can sand it and wax it if you do manage to damage it.

Virtually any office environment includes a desk. These desks can take many different forms, from small tables to large wrap-around desks with drawers. The type of desk an office needs depends on the type of work that needs to be done at the desk. Some desks are made especially for computers, while others are designed primarily for filing papers and storing supplies. Before purchasing desks for your office, think about the needs of your employees and what features a desk will need to be functional in your office. If you begin looking for desks before you have identified which features are important to you, you may be lured in by cheap or poor quality desks that do not meet your needs.

This chapter is an introduction to the latter part of the prophecies of this book. Whether what is contained between this and the sounding of the seventh trumpet (11:15) be a distinct prophecy from the other, or only a more general account of some of the principal things included in the other, is disputed by our curious enquirers into these abstruse writings. However, here we have, I. A remarkable description of a very glorious angel with an open book in his hand (v. 1-3). II. An account of seven thunders which the apostle heard, as echoing to the voice of this angel, and communicating some discoveries, which the apostle was not yet allowed to write (v. 4). III. The solemn oath taken by him who had the book in his hand (v. 5-7). IV. The charge given to the apostle, and observed by him (v. 8–11).
Here we have an account of another vision the apostle was favoured with, between the sounding of the sixth trumpet and that of the seventh. And we observe,
I. The person who was principally concerned in communicating this discovery to John—an angel from heaven, another mighty angel, who is so set forth as would induce one to think it could be no other than our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ! 1. He was clothed with a cloud: he veils his glory, which is too great for mortality to behold; and he throws a veil upon his dispensations. Clouds and darkness are round about him. 2. A rainbow was upon his head; he is always mindful of his covenant, and, when his conduct is most mysterious, yet it is perfectly just and faithful. 3. His face was as the sun, all bright, and full of lustre and majesty, ch. 1:16. 4. His feet were as pillars of fire; all his ways, both of grace and providence, are pure and steady.
II. His station and posture: He set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the earth, to show the absolute power and dominion he had over the world. And he held in his hand a little book opened, probably the same that was before sealed, but was now opened, and gradually fulfilled by him.
III. His awful voice: He cried aloud, as when a lion roareth (v. 3), and his awful voice was echoed by seven thunders, seven solemn and terrible ways of discovering the mind of God.
IV. The prohibition given to the apostle, that he should not publish, but conceal what he had learned from the seven thunders, v. 4. The apostle was for preserving and publishing every thing he saw and heard in these visions, but the time had not yet come.
V. The solemn oath taken by this mighty angel. 1. The manner of his swearing: He lifted up his hand to heaven, and swore by him that liveth for ever, by himself, as God often has done, or by God as God, to whom he, as Lord, Redeemer, and ruler of the world, now appeals. 2. The matter of the oath: that there shall be time no longer; either, (1.) That there shall be now no longer delay in fulfilling the predictions of this book than till the last angel should sound; then every thing should be put into speedy execution: the mystery of God shall be finished, v. 7. Or, (2.) That when this mystery of God is finished time itself shall be no more, as being the measure of things that are in a mutable changing state; but all things shall be at length for ever fixed, and so time itself swallowed up in eternity.
Here we have, I. A strict charge given to the apostle, which was, 1. That he should go and take the little book out of the hands of that mighty angel mentioned before. This charge was given, not by the angel himself who stood upon the earth, but by the same voice from heaven that in the fourth verse had lain an injunction upon him not to write what he had discerned by the seven thunders. 2. To eat the book; this part of the charge was given by the angel himself, hinting to the apostle that before he should publish what he had discovered he must more thoroughly digest the predictions, and be in himself suitably affected with them.
II. An account of the taste and relish which this little book would have, when the apostle had taken it in; at first, while in his mouth, sweet. All persons feel a pleasure in looking into future events, and in having them foretold; and all good men love to receive a word from God, of what import soever it be. But, when this book of prophecy was more thoroughly digested by the apostle, the contents would be bitter; these were things so awful and terrible, such grievous persecutions of the people of God, and such desolation made in the earth, that the foresight and foreknowledge of them would not be pleasant, but painful to the mind of the apostle: thus was Ezekiel's prophecy to him, ch. 3:3.
III. The apostle's discharge of the duty he was called to (v. 10): He took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up, and he found the relish to be as was told him. 1. It becomes the servants of God to digest in their own souls the messages they bring to others in his name, and to be suitably affected therewith themselves. 2. It becomes them to deliver every message with which they are charged, whether pleasing or unpleasing to men. That which is least pleasing may be most profitable; however, God's messengers must not keep back any part of the counsel of God.
IV. The apostle is made to know that this book of prophecy, which he had now taken in, was not given him merely to gratify his own curiosity, or to affect him with pleasure or pain, but to be communicated by him to the world. Here his prophetical commission seems to be renewed, and he is ordered to prepare for another embassy, to convey those declarations of the mind and will of God which are of great importance to all the world, and to the highest and greatest men in the world, and such should be read and recorded in many languages. This indeed is the case; we have them in our language, and are all obliged to attend to them, humbly to enquire into the meaning of them, and firmly to believe that every thing shall have its accomplishment in the proper time; and, when the prophecies shall be fulfilled, the sense and truth of them will appear, and the omniscience, power, and faithfulness of the great God will be adored.
There is a God who created all that we know...the heavens and the earth. This God consists of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Each of us are created in the image of God. God wants for us all to be saved and to be able to live eternally in heaven.
Satan (also called the Devil) wants us to fall away from God. Satan wants us to commit sin...to miss the mark that God has set out for us. Satan knows that the wages of our sin, is our death. If Satan can convince us to ignore God's word and to continue to sin, then he will draw us away from God forever.
While we were still sinners...God the Father sent His only Son, Jesus Christ, to pay the penalty for our sins. Jesus died on the cross in Jerusalem in ~A.D.30 and, as a result, allows us to have our sins forgiven. We do not need to suffer the punishment of our own sins, if we accept Christ according to what the Bible says. Jesus said "not everyone who calls me 'Lord, Lord' will inherit the kingdom, but those who do the will of His Father." Let's learn together what the will of God is for our lives.

The Bible says that Jesus will come back some day and those that are in Christ will go to meet Him in the air (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).
If Jesus were to come today, do you know for certain that you would go up in the clouds...to meet Him in the air...and to go to that heaven that He has prepared for His followers (see John 14:1-3).
One way to think about ancient sacrifices is as “gifts” given to God. When they performed sacrifices, ancient Israelites gave to God some of what they believed God had given them, expressing their close relationship with God and seeking to deepen that bond.
In the Hebrew Bible, sacrifice always involves transformation. One of the most common ways to transform something is to destroy it. Destruction removes the animal from the ordinary realm and transfers it to a transcendent one. Biblical texts tell us that God received the smoke of the burning sacrifice as a “pleasing odor” (see, for example, Lev 1:13). In so doing, God enjoyed a fellowship meal with human beings in God’s dwelling on earth—the temple.
The temple was a domestic setting, the place of God’s presence with the nation. One of the most common terms for the temple was ”house,” and it had furnishings, such as a lamp and a table. The altar was a cooking surface, a barbecue, so to speak, where the sacrificial animal was “cooked.” Burning up or “over-cooking” the sacrifices in the altar fire marked out the specialness of the food offerings.
Instructions for the performance of various types of sacrifices are found in the first seven chapters of the book of Leviticus. There are five main types of grain and animal sacrifice:
Burnt offering (Hebrew, ‘olah; literally, “ascending offering”; Lev 1, Lev 6:8-13) could be a herd or flock animal (bull, sheep, or goat) or a bird (dove or pigeon). The whole animal was burned in the altar fire. It was the most extravagant sacrifice because the entirety was given to God.
Grain offering (Hebrew, minhah; literally, “gift”; Lev 2, Lev 6:14-23) was an offering of fine flour or unleavened baked goods, mixed with oil. A handful of the offering was burned (with incense) in the altar fire. The rest went to the priests.
Sacrifice of well-being/fellowship offering (Hebrew, zevah shelamim; Lev 3, Lev 7:11-35) could be a herd or flock animal. Innards (fat, kidneys, and part of the liver) were burned in the altar fire. Most of the animal was eaten, divided between the priests and the offerer. This sacrifice was associated with feasting and well-being.
Sin/purification offering (Hebrew, hatta’t; Lev 4:1-5:13, Lev 6:24-30) dealt with disruption in the relationship between human beings and God. The offering depended on the identity and status of the person required to make it. The chief priest, for example, had to bring a bull, whereas ordinary Israelites brought a female goat or lamb. Those who were too poor to afford a goat or sheep could offer birds, and an offering of grain flour was acceptable from the very poor.
Guilt offering (Hebrew, ’asham; literally, “responsibility”; Lev 5:14-6:7, Lev 7:1-10) dealt with distinct categories of wrongdoing that disrupted the divine-human relationship, such as unintentional desecration of sacred things. The prescribed sacrifice was a flock animal. As with the sacrifice of well-being and the sin offering, innards were burned in the altar fire; the animal’s flesh was eaten by the priests.
These five varied sacrificial offerings have one element in common: the burning of some portion in the altar fire to transform the offering into smoke or a “pleasing odor” that God could enjoy.
Sacrifice is not a do-it-yourself activity in Leviticus. Rather, priests are required to bring about the transfer and transformation of the offering. Not only are they expert in the proper procedures, but they also bear the risk of moving into God’s presence.
Every animal sacrifice includes special treatment of the animal’s blood, which various biblical passages identity with the life force of the animal (see, for example, Gen 9:4, Deut 12:23). Despite the clear importance of this ritual use of blood, only one verse in the entire Hebrew Bible appears to explain its significance (Lev 17:11). This debated but crucial verse concerns life, not death; animal life on the altar preserves and enhances human life.
William K. Gilders teaches Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) at Emory University, with emphases on ritual and sacrifice in ancient Israel and on premodern Jewish biblical interpretation (midrash and medieval commentaries). He is the author of Blood Ritual in the Hebrew Bible: Meaning and Power (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004).
Through a great variety of forms and uses, biblical curses typically serve to affirm the sovereignty of the God of Israel.
In its original context, Leviticus 19:18 meant that you should treat your fellow Israelite properly, but it is part of a larger legal collection that also commands love of the stranger.
In the world of the Hebrew Bible, sin and guilt produce a real burden that plagues people, pollutes the sanctuary, and prevents safe human-divine interaction.
The ritual killing and offering of animals to deities, often on an altar and intended as good for the gods.
The anointed high priest who enjoys a status above that of regular priests; the chief priest is the only priest allowed to enter the innermost sanctum of the tabernacle or temple, the holy of holies.
A West Semitic language, in which most of the Hebrew Bible is written except for parts of Daniel and Ezra. Hebrew is regarded as the spoken language of ancient Israel but is largely replaced by Aramaic in the Persian period.
The set of Biblical books shared by Jews and Christians. A more neutral alternative to "Old Testament."
The artistic and sometimes symbolic public communication of social, political, or religious events, more common in oral cultures.
The means of cleansing oneself of any ritual impurity that would prevent participation in religious observance such as sacrifice at the temple.
Relating to the system of ritual slaughter and offering to a deity, often performed on an altar in a temple.

Choral Music 1	Biblical and theological overview Inspirational artwork has a greater likelihood of selling, but that work is less illustrative of biblical stories and more metaphoric of “God’s love for mankind, the beauty of the world God created,” said Daniel Gerhartz, a painter in Kewaskum, Wis., who is well-known in the Christian art realm but largely supports himself from the sale of figurative and landscape paintings in a number of galleries, most of them located west of the Mississippi. “Collectors find spiritual overtones in my art resonating with them.” The owners of these galleries agree, referring to the artist’s work as spiritual in content, usually conveyed through a special light that shines on a particular subject, but making no specific references to any religious faith. Dan Blanchard, owner of the Grapevine Gallery in Oklahoma City, Okla., noted that “we don’t get a whole lot of his religious work. We sell more of his landscapes,” and David Wilkinson, director of Legacy Gallery in Scottsdale, Ariz., also stated that the gallery “hasn’t shown much Christian art. There’s not a whole lot of people saying they want it.” Johnsen believes large, secular chains hold a lot of opportunity potential, as well as partnering with ministries and church leaders.

Verse 9 says that some people are given the gift of faith, but the gift is not specifically explained. All believers have been given saving faith by God as the only means of salvation (Ephesians 2:8-9), but not all believers are given the spiritual gift of faith. Like all the gifts of the Holy Spirit, the spiritual gift of faith was given for the “common good,” which means the edifying of the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:7).

The Lovels of Arden is a somewhat gothic, Victorian Romance about the life of a young woman who was raised in wealth and privilege, but who returns home from her schooling on the continent to discover that her life has drastically changed for the worse.
While Clarissa Lovel travels home by train after years away at a private seminary school in France, she meets a handsome young man on the train, one George Fairfax, who lets slip that Arden Court, her childhood home, was sold to pay of family debts while she was gone.
Always somewhat distant from her father, especially since the mysterious dismissal of her brother from the home some years ago, Clarissa attempts to adjust to her new life in a tiny cottage. She tries to behave well and do good in order to gain her father's affection.
A dear family friend, Lady Laura, sees Clarissa's plight and takes pity, offering to make her a guest at Hale Castle indefinitely so that she can mix with other people her age, and see a bit more of the country.
While she is a guest of Lady Laura, Clarissa discovers the identify of her companion on the train, and soon finds herself falling in love with George Fairfax who is hopelessly bound to another woman by a long-standing engagement.
Clarissa knows her feelings for George are wrong, and she is too good a person to get in the middle of his relationship, but George himself attempts to make her stray from her pious resolve, for he too is deeply in love with her.
When Clarissa receives the attentions of the new owner of Arden Court, a good but somewhat older man, Mr. Granger, though her heart hesitates to reciprocate his affection for her, her good sense tells her that this match will not only secure a future for herself and bring her childhood home back into the family, but it should also put a halt to George Fairfax's inappropriate attempts at wooing her behind his fianc�e's back.
Mary Elizabeth Braddon weaves a tale of romance and intrigue with heart wrenching narrative and unexpected twists throughout. And the ending is not so predictable as one might expect of a novel from this era.
Best part of story, including ending: I loved the gothic feel, and the utterly delightful sense of intrigue that always left me wanting to read more.
Best scene in story: Probably the part where Clarissa and her maid make a plan to escape from Mr. Granger's household.

White Chocolate Cheesecake: Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl, set over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure the water doesn’t touch the bowl. Set aside to cool to room temperature.
Meanwhile, in a food processor, blitz the milk, cream cheese and condensed milk until smooth. Add the chocolate and pulse to combine.
Whisk the cream by hand or with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form (careful not to over beat, else you will end up with butter). Gently fold the cream into the chocolate cheesecake mixture.
To Assemble: Unwrap the Easter Eggs and rest them in egg cups or shot glasses. Using a small pairing knife, dip the blade in a cup of hot water for a few seconds, wipe dry with a tea towel and gently remove the top off the Easter Eggs. Repeat until all tops have been removed.
Fill the hollow easter eggs by piping in the white chocolate cheesecake filling right up to the edge of the eggs.

For example, her baby brother is so noisy—he's as loud as a whistle, a horn, and even a fire truck!—that she creates a picture of him with whistles for eyes, a horn mouth, and holding a fire truck. After the girl has described everyone in her family (including herself, in great detail), she asks, "What does your special family look like?" encouraging readers to create their own portraits. With a list of objects at the end of the book to use as a guide, this is the ideal choice for budding artists everywhere.Here's a wonderful exploration of simile and metaphor for young readers. And don't miss the companion book My Best Friend is as Sharp as a Pencil!
I would use this book with every grade. It is very fun and has many different examples for students to review. I could have this book in my classroom for kindergarten to third grade. I would recommend this book to every teacher I come across. I could incorporate this into a lesson in many different ...
Along with her best friend, the fourteen-year-old narrator navigates a 1970s American girlhood, including challenges from popular girls and the first hints of womanhood.

Education is the finest way to move into a new career swiftly and competently, and one of the careers that is in demand today is that of the Administrative Assistant. To run their business smoothly, every company needs at least 1 administrative assistant, but not just for answering phone calls. Admin professionals do a lot more than that and that’s the reason that an administrative assistant course is so vital.
The skills that are required of admin assistants take time to learn and when you learn from an approved education center, your chances of getting a job in your desired field increase to a great extent. Some of the administrative assistant courses that are available are discussed below.
Administrative professionals work in many types of offices. While a general administrative assistant course would help you to get a job, you might be interested in taking a course that is more precise such as:
Employers are no longer looking for individuals to just answer their phones and look attractive when people come into the office. They require employees who are trained and skilled to do a wide variety of tasks. As per a study, the top 3 skills that employers look for while hiring people for Admin Assistant Jobs are the proficiency in operating word, windows and excel.
These 3 programs are quite easy to learn and if you have any degree which confirms your skills in these areas, then you stand a great chance of getting a good job.
Admin assistant coursescover topics such as economics, business basics, and office computer applications. Students learn how to prepare credentials such as statistical reports, manage projects and perform accounting tasks. Further, the classes focus on online communications and business writing along with business law, business management, keyboard techniques and office procedures.
There is also an administrative assistant training program and after its completion, students can seek employment in a wide range of organizations such as law, medical field, retail, education and corporate field.

When mercury attaches to the thiol protein in the heart muscle receptors and in the acetylcholine, the heart muscle cannot receive the vagus nerve electrical impulse for contraction.
Mercury accumulates in the heart muscle and heart valves, causing damage by attaching to thiol (SH-) proteins. This damage is indicated by EKG and confirmed by histologic study.
We had the President’s doctor Naresh Trehan ( Anna Hazares’s fasting time doctor too ) telling LIES about Ayurveda using Mercury Bhasma . I heard this LIAR on TV myself
As soon as Dr Naresh Trehan told about Ayurveda using mercury— as if on cue the EVIL PHARMA took the lead.
It all began with a paper published in 2004, authored by RB Saper et al, from the Harvard Medical School in Boston.
This paper concluded that “One of 5 Ayurvedic HMPs produced in South Asia and available in Boston South Asian grocery stores contains potentially harmful levels of lead, mercury, and/or arsenic. Users of Ayurvedic medicine may be at risk for heavy metal toxicity, and testing of Ayurvedic HMPs for toxic heavy metals should be mandatory.”
The paper sparked off a huge halla-gulla in the US, about how Ayurveda is ‘mumbo-jumbo’, and how India is poisoning innocent American citizens with toxic metals, etc, etc. More ‘scientific’ papers were published on the same theme, raving and ranting against Ayurveda and calling for an outright ban in the US.
The enteric nervous system has been described as a "second brain," which communicates with the central nervous system (CNS) through the parasympathetic (e.g., via the vagus nerve) and sympathetic nervous systems.
However, vertebrate studies show that when the vagus nerve is severed, the enteric nervous system continues to function.
ENS is not just capable of autonomy but also influences the brain. In fact, about 90 per cent of the signals passing along the vagus nerve come not from above, but from the ENS and that is why many consider it as a backup brain centered in our solar plexus.
It is our vagus nerve that provides the gateway between the two parts of the autonomic systems. The vagus acts as a bio-informational data bus that routes impulses going in two directions.
Since the vagus nerve acts as the central switchboard it should come as no surprise that impaired functioning of this one nerve can lead to so many different conditions and problems. Some neurological diseases actually come up from the gut spreading to the brain via the vagus nerve.
The vagus nerve uses the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. If our brain cannot communicate with our diaphragm via the release of acetylcholine from the vagus nerve then you will stop breathing.
The vagus nerve is one of the largest nerve systems in the body. Only the spinal column is bigger. Sometimes this nerve is referred to as cranial nerve X, the 10th cranial nerve. The vagus is used to send a variety of signals throughout the body, but will also transfer signals back to the brain.
The vagus nerve is constantly sending updated sensory information about the state of the body’s organs "upstream" to your brain via afferent nerves. In fact, 80-90% of the nerve fibers in the vagus nerve are dedicated to communicating the state of your viscera up to your brain.
A damaged vagus nerve cannot send signals to your stomach muscles. This may cause food to remain in your stomach longer, rather than move normally into your small intestine to be digested. As per Ayurveda 85% of diseases emanates from the intestines.
Yoga and Ayurveda went hand in hand . Vagus nerve regulates the chemical levels in the digestive system so that the intestines can process food and keep track of what types of nutrients are being gained from the food that is taken in.
In order to maintain homeostasis, the central nervous system responds constantly, via neural feedback, to environmental cues.
Since the vagus plays such an integral role in the regulation of heart rate and heart rate variability it follows that how we breathe when under stress makes all the difference in the world.
All yogic breathing is deep diagphragmatic breathing . Rogue Yoga gurus and slave doctors in the payroll of Zionist Jew evil pharma encourage people to do hyperventilation
He knows how to stimulate his vagus nerve, which carries sensory messages to and from the brain, and releases the neurotransmitter norepinephrine into the amygdala.
This strengthens memory storage in limbic regions of the brain that regulate arousal, memory and feeling responses to emotionally laden stimuli.
Deep diaphragmatic breathing—with a long, slow exhale—is key to stimulating the vagus nerve and slowing heart rate and blood pressure, especially in times of performance anxiety.
Stimulating the vagus nerve caused a reduction in heart rate by triggering the release of acetylcholine , the first neurotransmitter identified by Western scientists.
The sympathetic nervous system is mainly activated by stress and pre­pares the body for a fight. In other words, it is a survival mechanism that increases heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar and dilates the pupils. It is termed a “fight or flight” response.
Evolutionarily, it is necessary to be able to react promptly when facing immediate danger, but if the sym­pathetic nervous system becomes overburdened by prolonged stress, mobbing or hard physical activity, it will wear on the organism and has the potential to lead to fatal consequences.
The parasympathetic nervous system, however, has a calming influ­ence. It lowers the heart rate and blood pressure and simultaneously promotes digestion and the uptake of nutrients. It is termed “rest and digest”.
Hence, it is primarily during rest, eating and sleeping that the parasympathetic nervous system dominates and coordinates the body’s repose and regeneration. It is mainly this part of the nervous system that is advantageous to activate through breathing exercises.
The most fundamentally important ele­ments in the parasympathetic nervous system, the vagus nerve, is the most complex of all of our nerves. The vagus nerve connects the brain to everything from the tongue, pharynx, vocal chords, lungs, heart, stomach and intestines to different glands that produce enzymes and hormones, influencing digestion, me­tabolism, and much more.
This trinity, brain-heart-lungs, rules your body and governs your mind. The key to managing your state of mind and stress level lies in being able to activate the calming parasympathetic pathways of your nervous system on command.
Typi­cally, the will cannot control this part of the nervous system, but if you hold your breath for a brief moment ( KUMBHAKA ) and then slowly exhale, the vagus nerve is stimulated bringing peace to your body and mind.
Yogic deep diaphragmatic kumbhaka breathing exercises can make your heart larger and increase your stroke volume and cardiac output.
When people say “trust your gut” they are in many ways saying, “trust your vagus nerve.” Visceral feelings and gut-instincts are literally emotional intuitions transferred up to your brain via the vagus nerve.
The frequently observed rocking and swinging behaviors in autistic individuals is a naturally occurring bio-behavioral strategy to stimulate and regulate a vagal system that is not efficiently functioning.
Testosterone can make people more aggressive, but this is not the case when the vagus nerve is functioning right.
Vagus nerve stimulation by Yoga is associated with benefits such as improved memory, immune function, sleep, and higher levels of growth hormone. It helps tame inflammation, allergic responses, and tension headaches.
People ( Jews ) with under-active vagus nerves often experience severe gastrointestinal problems. The only way out is to do Yoga. . See I bollock them, yet I have given the Jews so many survival tips in my blogs.
Like an unconscious brain, the vagus nerve integrates feelings from the body and regulates essential functions including heart rate, blood pressure and respiration. Even feeding behavior is calibrated by the vagus, initiating digestion and providing the gut-brain signaling pathway.
The white man had a problem comprehending why Yoga asanas had so many impossible positions. Today they have invented ridiculous Christian yoga which does more harm than good.
People with a stronger vagus response recover more quickly after stress, injury or illness. Those with a weaker vagus response will likely take more time to recover.
Your gut uses the vagus nerve to tell your brain how you’re feeling via electric impulses which are called action potentials. This means that your "gut feelings" are actually very real.
Progesterone influences the growth in size of alveoli and lobes; high levels of progesterone inhibit lactation before birth. Progesterone levels drop after birth; this triggers the onset of copious milk production.
Estrogen stimulates the milk duct system to grow and differentiate. Like progesterone, high levels of estrogen also inhibit lactation. Estrogen levels also drop at delivery and remain low for the first several months of breastfeeding.
Breastfeeding mothers should avoid estrogen-based birth control methods, as a spike in estrogen levels may reduce a mother's milk supply
The baby acquires natural passive immunity because breast milk contains the mother's antibodies and other anti-infectious agents.
Breastfeeding prevents menstruation, which could be a method of natural birth control ( however it is not fail safe )
It is thought to reduce rates of obesity, therefore it reduces the risk of Type-2 diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension.
Colostrum is the first milk a breastfed baby receives. It contains higher amounts of white blood cells and antibodies than mature milk and is especially high in immunoglobulin A.
What colostrum lacks in volume it makes up for in power. Some people refer to colostrum as "high octane" milk. Colostrum protects newborns as they come into our world of bacteria and viruses, but also has a laxative effect that helps them expel the tarry first stools called meconium.
When you feed your baby colostrum, which may appear as clear fluid or be a deep golden color, it's as though you're giving him his first vaccination.
The most important advantage of breastfeeding is the nutritional composition of breast milk that has the perfect combination of water, protein, carbohydrates, immunoglobulin, cholesterol, fats, vitamins and minerals.
Breastfeeding also creates a unique bonding between mother and infant, which is CRITICAL to the child's later well-being. The first weeks tend to be the most difficult and then it gets easier.
So while some of the milk is actually sucked out by the baby, some simply gushes out into the baby's mouth. The mother experiences this as "letdown" - her milk is literally being let down into her nipples.
The milk now exists in two places inside her breasts: the fore milk is at her nipples, the hind milk is up in the lobules.
Though having a first baby late in life can have other effects on the body, it will not affect the breast milk at all; it is possible to produce as good milk for the child at 40 as at age 20. After stopping breastfeeding, some secretions occur for two or three months, sometimes as long as a year afterward.
Usually, a woman can breastfeed for two or three years, though a mother will probably want to combine breastfeeding with bottle feeding of breast milk or formula after a while.
Infants who are not breastfed are at mildly increased risk of developing acute and chronic diseases, including lower respiratory infection, ear infections, bacteremia, bacterial meningitis, botulism, urinary tract infection and necrotizing enterocolitis.
Breastfeeding may protect against sudden infant death syndrome, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease ( Jews please note ) , ulcerative colitis, lymphoma, allergic diseases, digestive diseases and may enhance cognitive development.
Hormones released during breastfeeding help to strengthen the maternal bond. Teaching partners how to manage common difficulties is associated with higher breastfeeding rates.
For breastfeeding women, long-term health benefits include reduced risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer -- Chutney Marys please note !
The pituitary is a pea-sized gland that is housed within a bony structure (sella turcica) at the base of the brain. The sella turcica protects the pituitary but allows very little room for expansion.
The pituitary controls the function of most other endocrine glands and is therefore sometimes called the master gland. The pituitary is controlled in large part by the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that lies just above the pituitary.
By detecting the levels of hormones produced by glands under the pituitary's control (target glands), the hypothalamus or the pituitary can determine how much stimulation the target glands need.
The lobes are connected to the hypothalamus by a stalk that contains blood vessels and nerve cell projections (nerve fibers, or axons). The hypothalamus controls the anterior lobe by releasing hormones through the connecting blood vessels. It controls the posterior lobe through nerve impulses.
Women don’t experience a refractory period exactly like men do, but losing interest in sex after an orgasm, or sleepiness, is completely normal. Due to this, women have the capacity for multiple orgasms without the need for a break in between.
After an orgasm, the refractory period for a man is completely out of his control and a natural occurrence in his body.
No matter what a dream is about, REM sleep will cause an erection in a man ( who is not impotent ). Even newborn boys have a boner during REM sleep! .
Birth hormones are chemical “messengers” that your body makes. Your baby makes birth hormones, too. These hormones work together to guide important changes in your bodies — changes that help make labor and birth go smoothly and safely for both of you.
Although higher testosterone levels are seen with abstinence, orgasm does not acutely affect testosterone levels in the blood.
Even after labour has started, there are certain conditions that will slow, or even stop the process. If the fight-or-flight hormones are activated by feelings of fear or danger, contractions will slow down.
Many women have had the experience of their labour stopping when they entered the unfamiliar surroundings of a hospital
Beta endorphin is one of the endorphin hormones which are released by the brain in times of stress or pain, and is a natural equivalent to painkilling drugs like pethidine.
During labour, beta-endorphin helps to relieve pain, and contributes to the “on another planet” feeling that women may experience when they labour without drugs. Levels of beta-endorphin are reduced when drugs are used for pain relief.
My cousin was planning for normal delivery.. no c-section / epidurals.... she even paased her due date.. at the end, her water broke and she fet no labor pains 5hrs after her water had broken.. she ended up having c-section...
It doesn’t hurt for your water bag to break — in fact, you may not even notice when it happens, unless you feel a little warm and wet down below. But for many women, the breaking of the water ushers in the painful part of labor.
If your water breaks before labor starts, it's called premature rupture of membranes (PROM).If your waters break before your baby has reached full term (37 weeks), the medical name for it is preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, or PPROM.
In an overwhelming majority of cases -- some 80 percent -- labor begins with contractions, then water breaking. In the other 20 percent, the water breaks first and is usually followed by labor pains within a few hours.
The likelihood is that your contractions will start within 24 hours to 48 hours of your water bag breaking. At least 60 per cent of women go into labour within 24 hours and most of the rest go into labour within 48 hours
Caesarean rates are lower when women waited for labour to start compared with those who were induced.
Most women's waters break during labour, after contractions have already begun. The waters protect you and your baby from infection.
Sometimes waters break before any other signs of labour, including contractions. This happens for about one in 10 women .
For about one in 50, their waters break earlier than this, before they are 37 weeks pregnant. Once your waters have broken, you may notice that your contractions start to feel more intense.
Amniotic fluid is almost 99 per cent water so it's normally clear with a yellow tinge or sometimes a pink tinge.
If you’re close to or past your due date, your water may contain some of your baby's first poo (meconium). This may result in the waters having a green tinge to them, or you may be able to see green or brown meconium .
If your baby hasn't arrived within 24 hours after your water broke, your doctor may give you antibiotics intravenously. That's because there's a chance an infection can travel into the uterus and cause an infection in the baby
If you experience premature rupture of membranes, your doctor might stimulate uterine contractions before labor begins on its own (labor induction). The longer it takes for labor to start after your water breaks, the greater the risk of you or your baby developing an infection.
If you are under 24 weeks of pregnancy and the baby is born, sadly, it is unlikely the baby will survive.
If you are over 30 weeks and the baby is born, the likelihood of your baby surviving is much higher - over 95%
Before 23 weeks, the baby needs ‘waters’ to be present for their lungs to develop normally. Loss of water before this can lead to severe problems with lung development that can be critical after birth.
After 23 weeks your baby does not need the amniotic fluid so much, so low levels of fluid may not be a problem in itself, but if the low levels are due to your waters breaking then there is a risk of infection..
You may also be treated with antibiotics, corticosteroids and magnesium sulphate (if you are less than 30 weeks) to help prepare your baby in case the baby is premature
Water bag is a special cushion for your baby. It gives your baby freedom to move within your body, and it gives the space so that when someone taps your belly, your baby isn’t in danger of a bruise.
And it helps regulate the temperature, so that your baby stays warm in the winter and cool in the summer. A woman should always mark the time when her water breaks
most doctors want the baby to be born within 24 hours to ensure that the baby is healthy. Sometimes, the doctor will give a woman some time for the contractions to begin on their own, but if they don’t within 12 hours or so, that may mean that the doctor recommends an induction, unless the baby would be premature.
One of the biggest dangers of water breaking before labor begins is the danger of the umbilical cord getting in the way. It’s called umbilical cord prolapse, and if the cord is in the way, it could get compressed by the baby in the birth canal.
The umbilical cord is still helping your baby get blood and oxygen during the delivery, and it is a big deal if that flow gets cut off. In fact, an umbilical cord prolapse usually results in a doctor recommending a C-section.

“We look forward to working with you.” That’s what most world leaders have been saying to President-elect Donald Trump
The German response has been markedly different. Angela Merkel carefully expressed conditionality when she said she looked forward to working with Trump on the basis of “shared values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and the dignity of man, independent of origin, skin colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views”.
Rotshchild's agent JEWESS Angela Merkel set the boundaries around what would be acceptable behaviour and politics with which she would cooperate.

Captanji our beloved Modi ji has declared that his next strike will be on Benami Properties and no one will be spared. Repercussions of this on anti nationals will be clear and loud. What they do with these benami properties will be important to see. Your word of advise to the Modi Government on acquisition of these Benami holdings and their apt use is awaited, Captain.
Your prediction was bang on. Even in mid November there is a lot of heat even at night time compared to earlier years. 2016 is the hottest year. All due to American Fracking. Kindly start a Trump election type social media campaign to force Trump and USA to take steps on this issue urgently. USA must stop polluting the globe. Captanji send message to Trump again in bold letters as is your style. Let America apologise to the world for their purposeful blind eye on Fracking on their soil.

Well guess what - the last 40 years have made people who value culture, religion and traditional family life devastated.

just saw mamata bannerjee boasting that HARDIK PATEL is on her side -- her speech on TV after she met BONG president over demonitisation
In the early 1960s when the diamond industry was still in its infancy, most of the traders and diamond workers in Surat were Jains and Patels ( MOSTLY CRYPTO JEW ).
More than 96% of the 8 lakh workers in the diamond industry belong to Saurashtra, which reflects increasing influence of Kathiawaris on the diamond trade--all Rothschild sponsored.
The Kathiawaris today control over 60% of the diamond trade in Surat. Who do you think wants the super fast train to mumbai--so that the diamond couriers dont have to pass through airport customs ? Surat the world's biggest centre of diamond cutting.
The CRYPTO JEW Jain community from Palanpur, North Gujarat, controlled India's diamond trade since its inception. This did NOT happen by accident . Rothschild made it happen.
the Kathiawaris, who are Patidars (Patels) from Saurashtra, have unravelled Palanpur's stranglehold on the multi BILLION USD industry. That the Patidar community has earned the sobriquet of 'hirawalas' demonstrates the Kathiawaris' dramatic evolution.

Shiv Sena too has joined with opposition parties against BJP opposing PM Modi's War on Black Money and Corruption.
As an ally of BJP, party like Shiv Sena was expected to support BJP Govt's noble initiative to root out corruption and black money from our Country. But, by joining hands with corrupt opposition parties who are in panic since 70 years of their ruthless loot is rendered worthless in just one day, Shiv Sena is losing its reputation and credibility as a trust worthy party that Hindus can rely upon.
While the common man of India is willing to bear this slight inconvenience for the long term benefit of a corruption free / black money free India, sickular corrupt parties like AAP, Congress, TMC, SP, BSP, DMK, Communist etc are shedding crocodile tears pretending to care for the people of India. No wonder Pakistan and ISI hates BJP Govt ruling India.
If Balasaheb Thackeray was alive, he would have fully supported PM Modi on surgical strikes against Black Money holders and corrupt people. Shiv Sena is making a blunder by joining opposition parties in Rajya Sabha.
It is time to abolish and dismantle this Rothschild created Rajya Sabha which VETO every good initiatives taken by the government for the development of India. India do not need this UNELECTED & Unconstitutional institution which does not have the Mandate of the People.

Apart from being a regular donor to the Clinton Foundation, Clinton herself was a director of Lafarge in the early 1990s, and did legal work for the firm in the 1980s
While Hillary Clinton served on the board for Lafarge, the company was embroiled in controversy over its use of hazardous waste to fuel its U.S. cement plants.
Lafarge entered the Indian market in 1999, through its cement business, with the acquisition of Tata Steel's cement activity. This acquisition was followed by the purchase of the Raymond Cement facility in 2001. Lafarge has cement plants in Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Haryana and West Bengal.

"With efforts to recover its dues hitting a virtual dead-end, the State Bank of India (SBI) seems to be have started a clean-up of its balance sheets by writing off loans worth about Rs 7,016 crore owed to it by more than 60 of its top 100 wilful defaulters."
"Banks exercising write-offs is a unique idea to clear bad loan impacts on balance sheets. Banks use the RBI approved tool, Advance Under Collection Accounts (AUCA), in which transfer of accounts to a specific AUCA is an NPA reduction strategy. It is resorted to after exhausting all avenues of recovery, restructuring and compromises. By writing-off bad and doubtful assets, banks can improve NPA ratios through cleansing of the balance sheet and tax benefits. All write-offs, except where one-time settlement or compromises are involved, irrespective of outstanding, should be treated as technical write-offs and parked in AUCA; recovery process of these accounts will continue till resolution of these accounts."

Purdue, 100% owned by the JEW Sacklers, has generated estimated sales of more than $40 billion since releasing its time-released, supposedly addiction-proof version of the painkiller oxycodone back in 1995.
In 2012, doctors wrote more than 282 million prescriptions for opioid painkillers, including OxyContin, Vicodin and Percocet – nearly enough for every American to have a bottle. These doctors got bonuses and sex trips.
OxyContin is responsible for the heroin epidemic in the US. The Rothschild media kept praising the Sacklers for philanthropy ( the wold in sheep's clothing ). Presidents kept quiet as they got donations
Sir can you also post what Obama have felt America with, people think he have saved america from every thing
Obama used multiple select measurements to tout the strength of the economy after his nearly 8 years in office--but failed to mention the 20 TRILLION usd external debt -- for this he must be prosecuted
Obama has doubled the US debt load and set records every year for debt increases during his Presidency.
His real record on the economy; the disaster that is Obamacare; his shocking abuses of taxpayer dollars; his bitterly divisive style of governing; his shameless usurping of the Constitution; his scandals and cover ups; his policy failures at home and abroad; the unprecedented expansion of government power… and more.
i lost the number of times i have stayed awake for 3 days at a stretch micromanaging tankcleaning and wallwash with methanol
Indeed very poor management, and actually it has been a high-headed way in which the whole thing has been rolled out.
Modi should have made provisions for swifter exchange of notes and provided enough amount of currency to eliminate the madness that we have witnessed after the sudden announcement of demonetization effective within a few hours.
There should have been currency and staff ready to deal with the situation (without giving them prior info).
Sir, bank managers have no experience in leading people in emergencies. They are selected by tests which can be passed only by attending special training, not on the basis of talent or performance. They are only supervisors. Every branch has a hidden leader, the go-to person who can influence other staff and gets things done. Union knows this person.
It dufficult to fill ATM cash with money as the new 2000 rupee notes are of different size and the present ATM machines are used to deliver old notes. So technically it will take longer time to despense cash. 100 rupee note is very rare, and its getting too dufficult to spend
Black money biz men are losing 20-30% of their black money stash. In 3-6 months they'll be at it again.
China is just like the United States and the EU. They’re just another massive world power that is using their economic clout to throw their weight around the world stage. And that economic clout is a big lie.
When the world figures out how insolvent and unsustainable these nations really are, their house of cards is going to crumble.
Reddy and his two brothers, were all cabinet ministers in the previous BJP's Karnataka state government
All three Reddy brothers (and the then CM B. S. Yeddyurappa) were removed from their ministerial positions for the mining scam
Janardhana Reddy and his brothers G. Karunakara Reddy and G. Somashekara Reddy were born into the Telugu speaking family of an IMPOVERISHED police constable Chenga Reddy,in Chittoor district Andhra Pradesh
Reddy brothers worked in the campaign for Sushma Swaraj -- and we know why Sushma Swaraj is now suddenly undergoing dialysis .
This is all intentional and planned, Mass psychological exercise, Orwellian in nature. Cognitive dissonance!
they still say that we haven't miniaturized KALI to be used as a weapon and we are planning KALI 10k. Also re charging it is taking a lot of time and in current shape it can't be used as a viable weapon but nevertheless it is way much better than laser beams of USA.
Aneesh expect an amendment to The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Act of 1951......Work is on on this front.....Temple money and Gold will become off limits to politicians very soon...
Suddenly television anchors and some perception moulders on debates have become Economics Experts...
There is a clear perception moulding going on in the media highlighting the negatives of this demonetisation exercise....
While indelible ink is only for cash exchange..this is not being specified....TV anchors are whining that ink is being put ...ink is being put...without specifying to whom and why...
One thief politician ex minister with a politico son with benami assets in 27 countries is making crooked laywer arguments on TV...
Which common citizen has 10 L cash at home??? Crooked lawyer arguments.....These are the same lawyers cum politicians who said ..Zero loss....Coal is still lying safe in mother earth...etc etc...
Captain I request you to start your own Ajit Vadakayil readers fan club Opinion polls on various questions and then send results to TOI and other kosher news media to allow them to publish the poll results. Try it at least once.
Total mismanagement sir! Better to get in touch with someone influential people who can "manage" things.
Bjp is a baniya party they only understand buy low sell higher - the principle of trading. This is a mass implementation which requires detailed planning and several contingency and risk management plans - way beyond their mental capacity.
Banks are playing dirty sport. On our office there are 6 ATMs, instead of depositing in 6 they only deposit in single ATM. I can't understand this logic. This only increases waiting time.
I went to ICICI bank yesterday to make a deposit and the bank was empty, i could find only 2 guys and bank employees, enquired the teller man and he informed that there is no cash since 2 days in all branches and they are also waiting for the cash from RBI. This is the reason ATM's & banks are empty also i doubt whether these banks help big fish corporates to exchange money back door.
REASON: Re-calibration for 500/2000 notes. Cash vans and technicians were on the run whole night updating the software.
Soros Foundation’s Ukraine branch, International Renaissance Foundation (IRF) has been involved in Ukraine since 1989. His IRF doled out more than $100 million to Ukrainian NGOs two years before the fall of the Soviet Union, creating the preconditions for Ukraine’s independence from Russia in 1991.
Soros’ foundations were also deeply involved in the 2004 Orange Revolution that brought the corrupt but pro-NATO Viktor Yushchenko into power with his American wife who had been in the US State Department
Let me tell you this-- this book is readable in English -- but it will be a fuckin' chore to read it in any other language
Even today after half a century, i remember how excited i was ( VALLEY OF ADVENTURE/ SEA OF ADVENTURE series )
Enid Blyton was accused of using only a limited vocabulary--so what ? she had DEPTH --the peabrains of this planet will never understand what i mean
After Enid Blytons's death , it became fashionable to denounce her stories as racist, sexist and out of touch. -- all this done by JK Rowling's agents
There definitely is some karmic connection of a lot of people with you as you appear to put into words, what they had thought or dreamt the previous day or night.
My own instance on this Oliver Strange and Sudden series of books read 40 years ago. I also used to read a series of Louis Lamour Cowboy books.
Looks like Trump is the "Sudden" or typical gambler turned good Sheriff/Marshall character of the 1800s western american world, quite outspoken and yet truthful, honest and virtuous, even if their personal world has gone astray.
After reading your blog I stopped having iodized salt and started using only sea salt or rock salt in my diet.
I have been trying to get off my lazy bum and am doing surya namaskar .. although not regularly.your post on surya namaskar is definitely the most exhaustive one available. But the devil lies in the detail... and i am having trouble grasping it.I want to do it the right way.. with the mantras... when exactly do we chant the mantra sir? Since we can chant only during exhaling... should we chant and then start the next asana? Also.. is it the shorter beej mantra that is to be chanted? I found one video where the practitioner does that. I know I am looking like I am asking to be spoon-fed...but I want to do it right.. and maybe most of the readers also will be happy to learn it right.enne sahāyikkū
Dear Ajit Sir, sorry if didn't understood correctly, but as soon as you chant the mantra, your breath gets exhaled automatically. then how can you follow the alternate exhale-inhale-exhale cycle with next poses in the sequence. there is also a plank pose where you hold the breathe.
In my thinking, while coming into every next pose you will have to necessarily inhale, then in that pose- chant the mantra which automatically exhales your breath, then go to next pose while inhaling. is it the right way sir please guide.
In 1978 there were no ATM machines and yet people were distributed cash by banks. Even today Banks can employ additional men and women to disburse cash by setting up additional desks with notes counting machines. The existing ATMS can be disconnected from the cash vending device and only card reader can remain active. After the card and it's demand is authenticated the cash can be handed over to card holder by hand by these additional employees. Many people may even Volunteer to work for free for such rational thinking banks.
This will definitely solve the issue of machines not being able to store or sort enough cash of different denominations. This is my humble suggestion Captain.
Same thing happened with WTO nairobi, Modi was praying with Jap PM at Varanasi ghats , when he should should have been micro-managing that JNU woman nirmala sitaraman.
Volume is too great for law enforcement. That's why the scamsters always win in India. Common people suffer.
I am curious about your foresight, your track record is so good I have to ask - what will be the commodity that will be the foundation of the economy for India to be #1. Right now post ww2, it's oil and the USA protecting the Saudi Oil. What will it be in 2032? Doesn't India need the most powerful army to stake a claim as the no. 1 superpower?
I hope this happens soon. I went on the Kailash Mansarovar yatra 2 months ago and it was quite disappointing that they (Chinese Govt) have banned entry to the inner quora of Kailash. So one has to only do the outer quora of 43-45kms over 3 days and come back. It felt pathetic not to be allowed even for Charn Sparsh of Kailash..we couldn't even touch the beautiful mountain! Only saw it from a distance!

It is a disgrace that G Reddy had worked in BJP and did lot of scams with support from BJP...until now people thought Sushma is a honest politician, but had bad deals from G brothers.Now this idiot is spending all his scam money like water
Ajitji, there were several artists that drew phantom comic strips. It was Sy Barry who started drawing and inking the strips from 1961 gave Phantom the masculine figure that you are talking of.
Keralites to PM Modi : Either to ask liquor shops to accept old notes Or ask banks to sell liquor. We can't stand in two lines each day.
What type of ground reports are you getting Captainji? It's not good in Kolkata. The bizmen are all laughing, as are netas, as both groups have found loopholes i.e. they are losing max 10 to 30%. Middle class is happy for the move but are getting annoyed with the inconvenience as this drags on. Poor are getting screwed, either no bank accounts, not enough money to farm, banks too far away, savings stashed now have to be exchanged etc.
- for the paid money exchanger/stand in queue guy the indelible ink is not an issue (he can remove it)
12-14% is the cash-to-GDP ratio, suggesting India is far away from a cashless economy. (In the US, the ratio is around 7.4% and in the UK, 3.3%)
90% of black money generated here is lying in tax havens abroad, according to the Prime Minister. Then, how can demonetisation help?
5-6% of black money is stock. The rest, the bulk of it, is a flow (invested somewhere). Will demonetisation make a big difference then?
0.028% or Rs 400 crore is the size of fake currency in circulation. Did you need to inconvenience so many people to fight such a percentage of fake currency?
Do ask that to the Indian soldier in Kashmir fighting the stone pelters paid by fake indian currency or to the Indian soldier fighting the maoists who are paid in fake currency.
When SIT on foreign money and amnesty scheme on foriegn money was announced they said 90% of black money is in India...
I lived in the USA, try seeing how long you can get away without paying your property taxes or any normal country for that matter. I think USA will become India and India will become USA in the next 5-10 years.
As the investor Jim Rodgers said - “If you were smart in 1807 you moved to London, if you were smart in 1907 you moved to New York City, and if you are smart in 2007 you move to Asia."
" studies say that period sex can help strengthen intimacy with your partner. So, why not? But letting a condom slip off during period sex is not fine "
Did you see that future where Trumps grand daughter will make a dent in univers or she will become a super leader?
A group of residents started the petition in October, when the campaign of the real-estate mogul and reality TV star was rocked by the release of a decade-old video tape of him making lewd remarks about women, saying they were embarrassed to live in a building with Trump’s name on it.
Yeah, can't let governments go overboard with this. Laying hands on Gold and other similar assets and prescribing limits should not be supported. They shouldn't forget government is for people, not vice versa.
If we weigh the pros and cons, digital India may be the way forward if APCO Modi doesn't touch privately held gold in India.
If you fast forward to the middle parts of the videos, then you can hear the similarity between these two recitations.
Here kids/teenagers, are made as delegates/chairpersons/secretary generals/etc and they pretend to represent various countries, influential people, etc.
What is it about this Janaagraha, Ramesh Ramanathan et al. Catch them young and puppeteer them??! They have Janalakshmi Financial Service also (microfinancing).
Recently my friend wwnt to italy for holidays and was going ga ga over da vinci.. what is this guy worth other than being gay?
I have been to italy myself, went to lot of their museums in Rome, Florence and saw a hell lot of painting (frankly got bored and sic of them).
In my view our ancient temples and carvings on them are much more sophisticated and beautiful than there ancient building and paintings which they boast.
2000 notes should be only a stopgap measure and should be withdrawn after everything is stabilised....These notes do not hv the nanochip....
The budget has been advanced to time before the state elections.... Luks like Income tax is going to be abolished from April 1 2018....
This is our ancient saes used to do and It Russia has preserved this through generation of knowledge sharing.
I get your point...BUT what the video link where russian does non contact combat...Ancient sages used to do in India, and now Russia has preserved this through generations of knowledge sharing.
I am from punjab, getting bit more curious everytime when you say that people don't know how Kejru got 4 lok sabha seats.
Sir this is true they have no clear policy or dont want to hav..coz farmers here not even getting proper rates for there produced food and instead have more expense to produce them...Sir why dont you make some post on it
When the goverment brought out the SIT On black money as per supreme court and amnesty for funds stashed abroad by Indians......
Dont u think Mamta and Kejri are purely envious about this move because they are worried about their cash stash as well as their voter constituency weaning towards the PM....
A rich wedding in a five star hotel is being shown on TV where people are sitting around round tables and the host is showing 500 notes and saying...Modi ne humaare shaadi pe surgical strike ki hai....

Suddenly Media is getting selected panelists and interviews with people who are perceptually BJP baiters to speak on debates and interview...

A month ago, an outdoor campaign rolled out for a week with a series of visuals introduced first as teasers stating that The Makers are the ones who "travel the world", "grow their talent", "get things for free", "are never alone" and "are up to date". The campaign sparked interest and curiosity by capturing the ‘spirit of youth and rebellion’ leaving everyone wondering who those makers are. A week later, the reveal campaign got plastered all over town promoting the new account Byblos Bank is offering to the youth aged 18-24.
In parallel, a 90-second TVC ran on local channels to spread the word even farther. The campaign has emotion, a good music score by Lebanese band Lumi, as well as a powerful and clever copy narrated by a resonant voice over coupled with beautiful film making elements that often go into a winning commercial.
Interested in learning more, ArabAd asked FP7 Beirut, the agency behind this campaign about the thought and strategy used.
"The exercise was challenging, given the fact that a lot of brands and products were already speaking and targeting this age group. Rather than promising them a world full of magic, we wanted to tell them that they were the magic our country needed," explained the creative team.
Truth is, for Lebanese youth, it’s harder to achieve their goals and dreams and even harder to achieve their independence and freedom.... all in all it was harder for them to “build” who they are. However, one thing the agency was clear on is that Lebanese youth are sick of being told what to do, what to say and how to say it. "We really wanted to get on their good side by positioning “Byblos Bank” as the cool uncle or aunt who have always given us the extra freedom because they believe we’re responsible enough to know what to do with it."
Summing all this up, the obvious thing for the agency was to create a pledge. Their pledge told by those who are going to make a difference. Those who are not afraid to move forward. Those who in order for them to create a new world, had to first create themselves.
"We started shooting in late July and went into postproduction in August, which is when the Beirut uprising started. We were afraid that we would be thought of as, riding the wave, but to our surprise, people and youth in particular, appreciated the campaign and the true messages it holds," FP7 team asserted.
All in all, this feel-good spot, which was originally created to target teens managed to score high with other demographic groups as comments on social media platforms showed, which goes to prove how well it was crafted.

From the 2013 ACORN Conference in Moncton NB. Pastured pork requires a process of trial and error. Sanitation and hygiene is one of the biggest challenges and having a good barn set up and cleaning routine is paramount. Decisions of when to put your animals on pasture and take them off help with animal nutrition and pasture longevity and health.
Paying attention to your pastures and grazing times is most important for maximising yield. Pastures provide most energy at certain stages in growth. Pigs will ruin a pasture if not taken off or put on at the wrong stage of plant growth. The mix of species in a pasture can be adjusted according to every farm and climate. Pay attention to managing pastures for best longevity and results.

The Organic Science Cluster is part of theCanadian Agri-Science Clusters Initiative of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's Growing ForwardPolicy Framework and is supported by contributions from industry partners.
The goals of the Organic Science Cluster are to facilitate a national strategic approach to organic science in Canada, link scientists across the country and disseminate the knowledge generated to organic stakeholders.
The Organic Science Cluster identified 10 sub-projects, including 30 research activities that were conducted by over 50 researchers plus 30 collaborators in approximately 45 research institutions. Activities of the Organic Science Cluster included work in fruit horticulture, agronomy, cereal crop breeding, soil fertility management, vegetable production, greenhouse production, dairy production systems, parasite control in ruminants, environmental sustainability, and food processing.
This research came at a time when there was renewed emphasis on innovation, efficiency (energy, labour, economics), and capturing value-added markets. Most of this research directed toward organic agriculture can also be applied to conventional production systems, drawing interest to this cluster from producers across Canada.

Tune in to News 88.7 FM’s morning segment every Friday at 6:35 a.m. and 8:35 a.m. to hear Bauer faculty and business experts discuss business news, trends and issues.
In 2008, TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, LP filed a Presidential Permit with the Department of State to build the Keystone XL pipeline, consisting of 1,700 miles of pipeline running from Alberta, Canada, to Houston, TX.
Stephen Arbogast, an executive professor of finance at the University of Houston C. T. Bauer College of Business, stopped by Bauer Business Focus to discuss recent developments in the the Keystone project and the potential impact on the City of Houston.
“Obviously the pipeline is going to mean jobs, and it’s going to mean a better slate of crude oil for the refineries outside of Houston,” Arbogast said. “I think the biggest thing is that it’s going to move the pricing basis for North American crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma, down to the U.S. Gulf Coast around Houston.”
With the project still in review after three years, there is some doubt brewing whether or not the pipeline project will ever be completed.
“I think the odds that some pipeline gets built somewhere that basically enables Canadian tar sands oil to come all the way to the Gulf Coast are very high,” Arbogast added. “Whether those pipelines or that pipeline will be built is the Keystone XL pipeline that looks very much up for grabs.”

Top Ten Tuesday is a weekly meme hosted by Jana at That Artsy Reader Girl. This meme was originally created at The Broke and the Bookish because they're particularly fond of lists. I am too so that's why I am participating this week.
1. Complete a family read. I want my family to read the same book and get together to talk about it. I think it would be a lot of fun, but I know that I will have to do a lot of convincing to make it happen.
2. Attend Books Signings. This year I'm planning on going to 3 book signings - Roanoke Author Event (April), Book Bonanza (July), and Renaissance Author Event (October). I'm so excited! I'll get to meet and hang out with some of my favorite authors, catch up with my reader friends and make some new ones!
4. Hang out with my book friends! I've made a lot of friends and made connections because of books. I can't wait to spend time with them this year at book clubs and signings.
5. Go see Forever My Girl! In 2013, I started off the year by reading Forever My Girl by Heidi McLaughlin, and I fell in love with this story of first love and second chances. I'm so excited that Heidi's book was made into a movie. Forever My Girl and the rest of this series has been a TOP RECOMMENDATION for years!
7. Track the amount of money I spend on books. I did this for a few months last year and it curbed the number of books added to my TBR pile and added a few dollars to my wallet.
8. Reading Goals: read 100 books and review at least half of them. Read books from my shelves/books that I've owned prior to 2018.
9. Finish the ABC Reading Challenge I started in November 2017. I still have about two-thirds of the alphabet to go.
Great list. Tracking the amount of money spent on books sounds s scary though! XD Going on a reader/writer retreat would be amazing!
Also, I need to get rid of some books as well. My local library does a monthly book sale to support itself and I need to find out how to donate.
I need to donate my books as well, after I finally get to reading them. I found a twitter thread of different charities and stuff to send books to. I need to find that again.
I'll keep my favorites and especially the ones that are signed, but it is definitely time to let some go.
I'm in love with your reading goals!!! I've never attended a book signing, but always though they sounded like a ton of fun. I'd also love to do a reading retreat sometime - the closest I've gotten was when my husband went out of town during Dewey's 24-hour readathon last fall :) Also Pride and Prejudice is on my reread list this year.... basically I want to steal your resolutions :) Hope you enjoy "My Girl" - just saw that it opens this weekend :)

We were going to go float tubing on a hill loch for pike yesterday, but with the forecast not looking to great we had a change of plan. Col was speaking to a very knowledgeable coarse angler who had had a great session on a local venue for Tench during the week, so we thought we would give it a try instead.
Getting to the swim we wanted to fish was no easy task, but after fighting through the thick undergrowth we finally arrived at the hot spot. We set up our rods to float fish the lift method, then started to introduce balls of ground bait to the swim with red maggots for hook bait. Encouragingly there were quite a few Tench rolling on the surface and soon we saw the great sight of fizzing bubbles enter the swim. My float lifted and I was excited to get my first glimpse of a good tench which tore of in the shallow water, great fight and 3lb 8oz, a good start!
a period of inactivity followed before the last fish of the morning, I could see the slightest movement on my float and sensed I was about to get a take, this time the float shot under rather than lifting, another good fish over 3lb's.
The sport dried up completely into the early afternoon with no sign of any tench in the swim, so we decided to go home and come back in the evening in the hope that they would be on the move again. In the evening there was one or two rolling on the surface but nothing like in the morning, Cols float eventually did register a bite but unfortunately not a tench!
This weekend i fancied a change from trout fishing , Brian suggested we try St Abbs harbour just to see what we could pick up . First stop though was mikes tackle shop to see if we could get a few bits of tackle, being new to this LRF game we are steadily building up a bit tackle , and soft baits, and hopefully with that, and time we will attain a better understanding of the methods and techniques used by the seasoned lrf'er.
The sea was fairly flat when we got there before low tide, first i tried a 2g jig head with a peice of tan isome and i managed a wee sea scorpion.
Brian was fishing a dropshot rig and was quickly into fish also a few more sea scorpions and then the first flounder on gulp sandworms, i decided at that point to also change to a dropshot set up as it seemed more productive, well for Brian anyway.
After sport slowed a little then Brian found a hot spot where he started getting more flounder , the best of the day unfortunately got off , whilst handlining it up to the quayside, we had a longhandled landing net but it was a little short .
Brian was doing a bit better than i getting more bites , i was getting a bit worried i was doing something wrong when i hooked up using half a xl red isome.
As the day wore on and the bites dried up we decided to head back home , it had been a great trip . Content with our day, and that we marginally had a better understanding of LRF than when we arrived, cant wait to do it again and with a bit luck ,we will extend our species range using these methods over the coming months.
Ive been a bit lacking enthusiasm of late, so this evening i decided to do something a bit differant or atleast it felt like it, i decided on my old stomping ground , been a good while since i wet a line on this part of the river, and the memories lived up to expectation .
The river was low and the stones ,covered in slimy slippy green algae as we have not had any rain for several weeks now, the air thick with spinners and midge. But in the early part of the evening the nymph ruled supreme , the deeper pocket water and runs producing the best sport, the first fish i hooked got off as it embedded my tippet in a clump of algae , pretty much a lesson from the off, "play them hard"! But after that i got into the groove.
As the evening wore on and more risers became more evident i decided to try a rusty spinner , and i did the trick taking a few more trout before calling it a night at 9:30 pm.
it was greatfishing this stretch again , must do it again befor ethe seasons out , till then i fancy a change of scene , perhaps pike or pehaps a trip to a beach?
Went back up to the highland stream hoping it mightbe a bit more on. Still very slow but i think the main reason for lack of sport had far more to do with the lack of flow, really needs rain as the hatch looked quite promising today.some lovely plants on show including globe flower , a indicator species the sign of fertility in the area.
To the fishing , hard work , tried lots of methods in differant pools to try and get a response , had a good spell late on in then day, taking several trout including this bizarre looking "spotless trout"
You can see by his head some fodder he coughed up a couple of parr and some gadgers (stonefly nymph)
After that in the next pool i saw a rise form at the head of the pool, i decided to cover it with a big klinkhammer , he ignored it for the first few casts , but eventually took it, a good trout , perhaps 3lb , all was going well then the hook came out! och well , cant win them all!
Once your 3D build has completed, the part on the print platform is considered green until it has been through post-processing. A green part must be handled with 100% nitrile gloves at all times. This section describes how to post-process the part, rendering it safe to handle without nitrile gloves. You will need lint-free paper towels to catch material that may drip from the part, recommended solvent, and two cleaning tubs (included).
CAUTION: Always follow the precautions noted on the SDS sheets for any material or solvent being used.
Place a paper towel under the part. Lift up the locking handle to allow the print platform to be removed.
NOTE: Material may drip from the part. The towel is used to collect dripping material so that printer components are not exposed to material.
Remove print platform from printer with printed part attached. Support the paper towel underneath with your hand so that it does not dip into the material in the print tray.
CAUTION: Do not remove the printed part from the print platform while platform is still in the machine. Doing so risks getting partially cured print material in the print tray, which will damage future builds if not cleaned out.
Continue holding the paper towel under the print platform when transporting it to the first stage of post-processing.
Ever since I passed that age 30+ mark, my friends and family have incessantly asked, “So… why aren’t you married yet?” I keep replying, “Because I don’t want to be;” but for some reason, my answer doesn’t provide the social conformation that they seem to be seeking from me. Here’s my real answer. E=MC2
The Theory of Relativity states: time is dependent on the relative motion of an observer measuring the time. In short, it’s my time when I (and only I) think it is. My bachelor lifestyle doesn’t have a built-in expiration date and I don’t feel like I’m missing out on something while casually dating a variety of amazing, interesting and most of all exciting women. Moreover, the term settle down perfectly describes the reasoning behind most age 30+ marriages. People are getting married because it is “weird” not to be.
I have observed some of my 30+ female friends either over analyze the “marriageability” of a man after the first date or end an otherwise fulfilling relationship because the guy wasn’t moving towards marriage fast enough. When I asked them why they wanted to get married, their answers were elaborate and eloquent, but simplified down to social status and security.
As we get older, the word “single” becomes increasingly disturbing, causing our insecurities to rise and desperation to set in. This plight reminds me of a quote from Milton’s Paradise Lost, “The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.”
Hey, maybe I’ll find “the one” and feel differently… or maybe some of us are meant for the two, three or four. Your thoughts?
Following general scenic work completed in time for the Basingstoke exhibition, a start has been made on some detailing and buildings. One important detail item is the starting signal. Fortunately there is only the one proper signal on the layout, as it has taken 6 months to build it. The two ground signals required will be another story.
I wanted to build a typical SR rail-built upper quadrant signal, operational of course. I purchased some etched brass signal boards, counterweights, brackets and ladders from MSE. The post would be scratch built, using bullhead rail from the 2mm Scale Association. I laid two longish lengths of rail together, and joined them with a blob of solder at each end. I could then drill through the pair for the joining bolts at the correct intervals, confident that they would line up later when the rails were parted. I found a piece of card of suitable thickness, and cut comb-like teeth into it. With some wire passed through the rail holes at each end, I could then sandwich the two rails either side of the card and solder the joining wires in each hole, with the card keeping the rails the correct distance apart. The comb slots in the card meant the resulting signal post could be slid off the card once complete.
I had some small surface mount gold-white LEDs, and decided to use one as the signal lamp. It is rectangular rather than cylindrical, but is about the right size. I formed a triangular bracket from some unused nickel-silver etch and soldered it to the signal post, and one end of the LED to the top of the bracket. This formed bothan electrical and a mechanical joint. Some very fine enamelled copper wire was soldered to the topmost terminal of the LED and runs down the post to the lampman's platform. The platform is actually a piece of thin double sided PCB. The lower face is soldered to the post with some more nickel-silver brackets. The top face is insulated from the post, and so the other end of the enamelled copper wire is soldered to it, as is the top end of the ladder. Electrical current for the LED therefore flows up the ladder, through the enamelled copper wire to the LED, and then down the signal post.
I used an old 4mm copper clad sleeper as a base for the signal, with the post passing through a hole drilled in the sleeper, and the lower end of the ladder through two smal holes. Both were soldered to the copper, again for both mechanical and electrical connection, the gap at the centre of the sleeper keeping them electrically separated.
A piece of nickel-silver was added to the top of the post for its cap, and some small backets from the MSE etch soldered to each side of a rail for the signal arm pivot wire to pass through. An MSE counterweight and bracket were made up and attached just below where the signal arm fits.
A pivot wire was soldered to a signal arm from the etch, and the arm and post were painted, sprayed with white primer, and then brush painted black and colour details. Some red and blue-green paint was mixed in some Krystal Klear PVA which was then added to form the spectacle plates in the holes in the signal arm.
The final bit of above ground work was to add the operating wires. This is a very fiddly job, requiring good right-angle bends in the wire and a lot of luck.
Below ground, I created a lever arm from some more PCB, pivoting on a wire pin through the two rails. The lower end of the operating wire passes through a small hole in the PCB. A couple more pins were soldered into holes drilled in the PCB to act as mechanical end stops, so the signal operating wire cannot be pulled or pushed further than required and thus causing damage.
The signal was then carefully glued into a hole in the baseboard, with the base covered with ballast and ground cover. I will probably regret not making it removeable when cleaning the track, but I have not found an unobtrusive detachable mounting method yet.
The final piece of the puzzle was the operating servo. One of the new design, 3D printed, Merg servo mounts was used, with the operating wire bent into a curious form to reach the lever arm below the signal. In the end, the operating movement was not as great as expected, and I could have got away with a smaller lever, but it works.
It is now configured into the Merg CBus system so that a single CBus event will raise the signal arm. This can be generated from a Merg CANCAB controller, or a simple push button on the control box I made to give simpler operation of the uncoupling magnets.
Any of the route setting events will lower the signal arm, so it should not be possible to forget returning the signal to danger before the next movement takes place.
I was recently chatting with my pal Stuart Kabak, about the upcoming Falcon Ridge Folk Festival and somehow we drifted into reminiscing about Woodstock. (the original, not the wannabes) It was my first festival and I really didn’t know what to expect. A lot of people coming to Falcon Ridge for the first time, also […]

A system for securely using digital signatures in a commercial cryptographic system that allows industry-wide security policy and authorization information to be encoded into the signatures and certificates by employing attribute certificates to enforce policy and authorization requirements. In addition to value limits, cosignature requirements and document type restrictions that can be placed on transactions, an organization can enforce with respect to any transaction geographical and temporal controls, age-of-signature limitations, preapproved counterparty limitations and confirm-to requirements by using attribute certificates for the transacting user. Restrictions on distribution of certificates can be set using attribute certificates. Certificates can be used also to ensure key confinement and non-decryption requirements of smartcards in this system.

This invention relates to digital signatures. More particularly, this invention relates to the use of digital signatures and certificates for digital signatures in a commercial cryptographic system for enforcing security policies and authorization requirements in a manner that reduces risks to the users.
Public-key cryptography is a modern computer security technology that can support the creation of paperless electronic document systems, providing that the user's digital signature on an electronic document, i.e., the user's electronic authentication and verification of the electronic document, can be given sufficient practical and legal meaning. Such paperless electronic document systems, or "document architectures," will encompass not only trading partners operating under standard bilateral contracts but also global multilateral systems in which any entity can, in theory, correspond with any other entity in a legally provable manner, assuming that proper security controls are observed throughout.
These systems will have enormous commercial significance because, in many cases, cost reductions on the order of 10-to-1 can be realized over current paper transaction procedures. This improvement is sufficiently dramatic such that many organizations would, for economic and competitive reasons, be compelled to use them once their practicality had been demonstrated.
No one disputes that paper is a bothersome anachronism in the electronic world or that verifying pen-and-ink signatures is costly and error-prone. At least with paper, however, the signer retains the basic "contextual controls" of document preparation and physical delivery. On a digitally signed electronic document, on the other hand, a signer controls only the encoded signature. All time, place and manner controls are absent, and nothing distinguishes a valid user signature from one fraudulently produced by another user who somehow obtained the first user's smart card and PIN. It would not take too many multi-million or multi-billion dollar losses to erase all the savings produced by this "newfangled" office-automation technology. Therefore, digital signatures will see early use only in consumer "electronic coin purse" applications, where exposure is low, and in wholesale financial transfers, as to which extremely tight security procedures are already the norm. However, these uses will have little general commercial impact.
Thus far, major corporations and banks have declined to invest in these technologies due to lack of well-defined risk models and auditing standards and due to uncertainties regarding legal and liability issues. Serious investments to commercialize digital signatures will occur only after leading national auditing and legal experts have ruled that these systems contain adequate security controls to warrant reliance in mainstream intra- and inter-corporate business transactions, typically in the $10,000 to $10 million range. In order for this goal to be achieved, security controls must be formulated to reduce the risks of participants in digital signature document systems to the absolute lowest level technically achievable.
There are two types of cryptographic systems in which digital signatures have been used: symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems. FIG. 1 illustrates the use of symmetric and asymmetric algorithms for encryption. In symmetric (conventional) cryptography, as shown in FIG. 1(a), the sender and recipient of a communication share a secret key 11. This key is used by the sender, the originator of a communication, to encrypt the message 12 and by the recipient of the communication to decrypt the message 13. It may also be used by the recipient to authenticate a message by having the sender use the secret key to compute some function such as a Message Authentication Code (MAC) based upon the message; the recipient thus can be assured of the identity of the originator, because only the sender and the recipient know the secret key used to compute the MAC. DES is an example of a symmetric cryptosystem.
In asymmetric (public key) cryptography, shown in FIG. 1(b), different keys are used to encrypt and decrypt a message. Each user is associated with a pair of keys. One key 15 (the public key) is publicly known and is used to encrypt messages 17 destined for that user, and the other key 16 (the private key) is known only to that user and is used to decrypt incoming messages 18. Since the public key need not be kept secret, it is no longer necessary to secretly convey a shared encryption key between communicating parties prior to exchanging confidential traffic or authenticating messages. RSA is the most well-known asymmetric algorithm.
A digital signature, however, is a block of data appended to a message data unit, and allows the recipient to prove the origin of the message data unit and to protect it against forgery. Some asymmetric algorithms (e.g., RSA) can also provide authentication and non-repudiation through use of digital signatures. In order to sign data, the sender encrypts the data under his own private key. In order to validate the data, the recipient decrypts it with the sender's public key. If the message is successfully decrypted using the sender's public key, the message must originally have been encrypted by the sender, because the sender is the only entity that knows the corresponding private key. Using this method of signing documents, the encrypted message is bound to the signature, because the recipient cannot verify the message without decrypting the signature data block. The signature-encrypted message can then be encrypted to the recipient using the recipient's public key, as usual.
Digital signatures may also be formed using asymmetric encryption algorithms as described below and as illustrated in FIG. 2. To sign a message, the message 20 is first digested (hashed) into a single block 22 using a one-way hash function 21. A one-way hash function has the property that, given the digest, it is computationally infeasible to construct any message that hashes to that value or to find two messages that hash to the same digest. The digest 22 is then encrypted with the user's private key 23, and the result 24 is appended to the encrypted or unencrypted message as its signature 25. The recipient uses the sender's public key 26 to decrypt the signature 25 into the hash digest 22. The recipient also digests (hashes) the message 20, which has been received either unencrypted or encrypted and then decrypted by the recipient, into a block 27 using the same one-way hash function 21 used by the sender. The recipient then verifies 28 the sender's signature by checking that the decrypted hash digest 22 is the same as the hashed message digest 27.
Separating the signature from the message in this way, i.e., not requiring the sender and recipient to encrypt and decrypt the entire message in order to verify the signature, greatly reduces the amount of data to be encrypted. This is important because public key algorithms are generally substantially slower than conventional algorithms, and processing the entire message in order to verify a signature would require a significant amount of time. The signature process also introduces redundancy into the message, which, because the message must hash to the specified digest, allows the recipient to detect unauthorized changes to the message.
A digital signature provides the security services of (a) integrity, because any modification of the data being signed will result in a different digest and thus a different signature; (b) origin authentication, because only the holder of the private key corresponding to the public key used for validation of the signature could have signed the message; and (c) non-repudiation, as irrevocable proof to a third party that only the signer, and not the recipient or its employees, could have created the signature. A symmetric secret key authenticator, e.g. the X9.9 FLAC, does not provide these services, since either of the two parties can create the authenticator using their shared key.
Several of the mechanisms discussed herein assume the ability to attach multiple signatures or cosignatures to a document. RSA Data Security, Inc., "PKCS #7: Cryptographic Message Syntax," 1993, which is hereby incorporated by reference, defines a useful format for this purpose. Each signature structure on a document will contain an indication of the certificate needed to validate the signature along with a bit string containing the actual signature. Additionally, other information relevant to the particular signer may be included in an individual signature computation. This per-signer information may be included in the signature computation as "signature attributes."
In order for one user to identify another user for transmission of a message in a way that ensures the second user's possession of a private key, the first user must be able to obtain the other user's public key from a trusted source. A framework for the use of public key certificates was defined in CCITT, "X.509: The Directory: Authentication Framework," April, 1993 ("X.509"), which is hereby incorporated by reference. These basic public key certificates bind a user's name to a public key and are signed by a trusted issuer called a Certification Authority (CA). Besides containing the user's name and public key, the certificate also contains the issuing CA's name, a serial number and a validity period.
Although X.509 does not impose any particular structure on the CAs, many implementations find it reasonable to impose a hierarchical structure in which each CA (in general) certifies only entities that are subordinate to it. Hence, we can construct a hierarchy of Cas, as shown in FIG. 3, in which the higher level CAs 31 (perhaps banks) sign the certificates 34 of the CAs 32 beneath them (e.g., companies), and the lowest level of CAs 32 sign user 33 certificates 35. At the top of this hierarchy (not shown) are a relatively few other root CAs, perhaps one per country, that may "cross-certify" each other's public keys (root keys).
Various security architectures define mechanisms to construct a certification path through the hierarchy to obtain a given user's certificate and all CA certificates necessary to validate it. These architectures share the common characteristic that a user need trust only one other public key in order to obtain and validate any other certificate. The trusted key may be that of the top-level CA (in a centralized trust model) or of the local CA that issued the user's certificate (in a decentralized model).
Certificates also contain an expiration date. If it is necessary to cancel a certificate prior to its expiration date, such as if the name association becomes invalid or the corresponding private key is lost or compromised, the certificate may be added to the CA's certificate revocation list (CRL) or "hot list." This list is signed by the CA and widely distributed, possibly as part of the CA's directory entry. The certificate remains on the CRL until the certificate's expiration date.
Often certain information concerning an entity or CA needs to be made available in a trusted manner. In a secure X.500 Directory, this information would be retrieved via standard Directory operations and the result would be signed by the Directory. In the absence of such a secure X.500 implementation, this information is placed in an attribute certificate, which is signed by a CA in the same manner as the public key certificate. Attribute certificates would be created on presentation of the proper credentials by the user. For example, the user would present his public key certificate and prove he possesses the corresponding private key, as one form of identification. Attribute certificates are linked to the user's basic public key certificate by referencing the basic certificate's serial number and are revoked by an identical parallel CRL mechanism. Attribute certificates are discussed further in ANSI X9F1, "X9.30 Part 3: Certificate Management for DSA," June, 1994, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,868,877, 5,005,200 and 5,214,702, which are all hereby incorporated by reference.
An attribute certificate is a structure separate from a public key certificate because proper separation of duties may often require that the CA that issues the attribute certificate be different than the CA that issues the public key certificate. A central CA might rarely of itself possess the required security or authority to "sign for" all of a user's authorizations. Having separate CAs generate various types of attribute certificates distributes risks more appropriately. In addition, the defined attributes may not be required for all domains, networks or applications. The need for these attributes and for additional domain-specific attributes is determined by each domain.
The user's basic public key certificate remains X.509 compatible, allowing its use with other applications and allowing use of commercial products for certificate generation.
It is desirable to be able to construct a trusted organization that utilizes digital signature and certificate mechanisms to enforce a security policy defined by rules within this organizational structure.
It is also desirable to use digital signature and certificate mechanisms to encode industry-wide security policy and authorization information into the signatures and certificates in order to permit the verifier of a signature to decide whether to accept the signature or certificate as valid, thus accommodating and easing electronic commerce business transactions.
It is further desirable to reduce the risks associated with digital signature systems, particularly with end-user smart cards, by building on this use of public key certificates and attribute certificates.
It is further desirable to prevent the use of such a digital signature system by any party that might purport to "accept" a transaction in contravention of the applicable authorization certificates when that party had not signed the applicable "system rules" agreement pertaining to that system of communicating signer authorization.
These and other objects of the invention are accomplished in accordance with the principles of the invention by providing a system for securely using digital signatures in a commercial cryptographic system that allows industry-wide security policy and authorization information to be encoded into the signatures and certificates by employing attribute certificates to enforce policy and authorization requirements. In addition to value limits, cosignature requirements and document type restrictions that can be placed on transactions, an organization can enforce with respect to any transaction geographical and temporal controls, age-of-signature limitations, preapproved counterparty limitations and confirm-to requirements by using attribute certificates for the transacting user. Restrictions on distribution of certificates can be set using attribute certificates. Certificates can be used also to ensure key confinement and non-decryption requirements of smartcards in this system.
The above and other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which the reference characters refer to like parts throughout and in which:

The following general principles and philosophies are reflected in the signature verification model defined in this invention. First, CA and user certificates can contain attributes that document the conditions and assumptions under which they were created. Verifiers may simply reject all certificates and transactions that do not meet their minimum standards.
Also, attribute certificates may be signed by a user's "sponsor" to signify that the sponsor's signature will be honored for official business if the transaction meets the requirements stated or implied by the attributes. Although typically the user's sponsor will be the user's employer, the model can be extended to include the user's bank, credit card issuer, voting bureau, video rental store, public library or any other entity that might accept the user's signature. This sponsor (authorization) certificate is thus the electronic equivalent of an "affidavit of legal mark," as used in the context of a traditional signature stamp. See Robert Jueneman, "Limiting the Liability of CAs and Individuals Regarding the Use of Digital Signatures," presented to the ABA Section of Science and Technology Certification Authority Work Group, Jul. 2, 1993.
Furthermore, industries may develop "industry policy" statements that establish minimum requirements for signature verification. All participants would sign these multilateral agreements in order to ensure that all counterparties would be bound by the encoded restrictions. Normally, sponsor certificates should be required in all cases, and digital signatures would be deemed otherwise null and void in their absence. Industry-wide policies would also define (1) relevant document types and classes, (2) signer roles and titles, and (3) coded symbols for incorporating by reference standard contractual terms and conditions.
Moreover, there must be strict adherence to the principle that all restrictions can be enforced in an entirely automated manner (i.e., verification "on sight"), without reference to paper agreements or human interpretation, sometimes also termed "fully machineable straight-through processing." In complex and/or high-volume environments, this is required in order to give these security controls credibility in the eyes of audit and legal experts. Reference to trusted third parties should also be minimized to reduce verification latency times.
While these restrictions seem complex, they merely reflect ordinary business procedures made explicit for purposes of machine verification. Formerly, such controls were enforced inside the sponsor's computer systems before sending out the transaction. However, with the advent of multilateral distributed transactions, the verifying user is typically off-line from his sponsor's system, and so the verifier must enforce the sponsor's authorization model, as reflected in the attribute certificates. Once this methodology is specified, office software vendors will develop menu-driven systems to create and manage user attributes, and the cost to user organizations will be relatively low.
The certificates themselves may reflect the structure of a sponsor organization. Because many authorization decisions are based on the user's position in an organization, the organizational structure and the user's position therein may be specified as part of a user's name. Names in certificates are specified in terms of the X.500 Directory model, as follows.
The X.500 Directory structure is hierarchical; the resulting distributed database comprises the Directory Information Tree (DIT), as shown in FIG. 4. Each entry 41 is of a specific object class and consists of a set of properties called attributes 42. An attribute 42 consists of a type 43 and one or more values 44. Thus, in an entry of class organization, one attribute is the organizationName; in an entry of class organizationalPerson, attributes might include title and telephoneNumber.
Each entry also has one or more special attribute values used to construct the object's name; this attribute value is the relative distinguished name (RDN) of the entry. An object's distinguished name (DN) 45, which is created by concatenating the relative distinguished names 46 of all entries from the DIT root to the entry, uniquely identifies the object in the global DIT.
Several of the attributes defined in X.500 may be usefully included in the user's attribute certificate. For example, the object class can be used to distinguish between entities (e.g. users and roles) whose distinguished names are of the same form. Also, the title may be used in making authorization decisions.
In addition to the use of the DIT to group entities along organizational lines, X.500 defines several object classes that can be used to construct arbitrary groups of entities. These object classes include the organizational role, whose "role occupant" attribute lists the names of the users who occupy the role, and the group of names, whose "member" attribute lists the names of group members. To convey this information in a trusted way, one could define role and group certificates that convey the names of the role occupants or group members, respectively, and that are signed by a CA, thus enabling use of this feature outside the context of an X.500 directory system.
Group and role certificates may be used in conjunction with a cosignature mechanism to simplify the construction of cosignature requirements. For example, a transaction might require the signatures of three occupants of the "purchasing agent" role. A user may also indicate the role in which he is acting by including the role in the signature computation as a (per-signer) signature attribute. The asserted role may then be matched against a role certificate (or the user's attribute certificate) during verification.
It is another embodiment of this invention to encode information regarding a CA's security policy into the attribute certificates of the CA and its subscribers, so that the verifier of a signature can use the information in determining whether to accept a signature as valid. In general, the CA's certificate will convey the rules that a CA uses when making certification decisions, while the user's certificate will convey the information used by the CA when applying these rules.
Attributes in CA certificates can indicate security policy and assurance information for a particular CA. This policy information can also be inherited by subordinate CAs, allowing easy construction of security domains sharing a common policy. Policy attributes in a CA's certificate might, among others, include:
(1) Liability Limitations: the extent to which a CA is liable in the event of various problems (e.g., CA key compromise, defective binding); this might be no liability, full liability or a specific monetary amount.
(2) Trust Specification: a description of which users and CAs a given CA can certify, expressed relative to the CA itself (e.g., "all subordinates"), or to the DIT in general (e.g., "the subtree below Organization ABC"), or to others.
(3) Required Attributes: a list of those attributes in the user's attribute certificates that must be verified against a transaction and/or its context in order for the transaction to be considered authorized. These attributes would be found in the certificate(s) of the sponsor and allow a single authorization certificate to contain authorization attributes for use with multiple applications. Some suggested user authorization attributes are defined later.
(4) Allowable Name Forms: a specification of the allowable name forms that the CA may certify. This information is held as (a) a set of name bindings, which defines the attributes that may be used to name entries of a given object class (i.e., the allowable RDN formats for entries of that class), and (b) a set of structure rules, which defines which object classes may be adjacent (i.e. superior or subordinate) to each other in the DIT, i.e., the order in which object classes may be chained together to form a complete DN. This policy attribute may be used to restrict the type of entities that may sign transactions. For example, for wire transfer applications, it might be desirable to restrict signature capability to the organization itself, rather than to users within the organization, since this is similar to the current mode of operation using DES MACs.
(5) Cross-Certificates: it may be desirable from an efficiency point of view to allow certifying entities and as organizations to cross-certify each other in order to constrain the length of certification paths. On the other hand, it is not desirable to allow certification paths to contain arbitrary numbers of cross certificates, as it is difficult to determine the level of trust in the entity at the other end. Many certification architectures restrict certification paths to contain only one cross-certificate. To accommodate a wider range of policies, an attribute may be added to the attribute certificate associated with the cross-certificate indicating that the cross-certifier explicitly allows the use of cross-certificates issued by the CA being cross-certified.
Attributes in a user's or entity's attribute certificate may represent the information verified by the CA when creating the certificate for the entity. Policy attributes in a user's certificate might, among others, include:
(1) Binding Information: the criteria used to bind the public key to the identity of the entity being certified. This includes (a) the method of delivery, such as being presented in person, by authorized agent, by mail or by another method; (b) the method of identification, such as by reasonable commercial practices, verified by trusted third party, dual control, fingerprint check, full background investigation or another method; (c) the identification documents presented to the CA; and (d) the subject's entity type, i.e. individual, corporation or other.
(2) Trusted Third Parties: the names of any trusted third parties or agents involved in the binding process.
(3) Roles: it may be useful for authorization purposes to indicate which roles (both internal and external to the organization) a user may exercise. This is in contrast to a role certificate, which would be issued to the role and contain the names of all occupants.
(4) Relative Identity: a CA may wish to certify only a portion of the DN of an individual. In particular, the CA might disclaim liability for correctness of an individual's personal name, since, under legal Agency principles, the individual's signature is binding on their organizational sponsor in any event. Consider the name:
The CA might certify only the validity of the organization, organizational unit and title portions of the individual's distinguished name, all of which are easy to verify, while the personal name would only be "reasonably believed accurate." In view of the relative ease of obtaining false identity papers, this avoids the need for prohibitively expensive background investigations. Such an identification can be relied on in an ordinary commercial setting but not in a proceeding concerning a will or inheritance, for example.
(5) Absolute Identity: we define relative identity as the user's identity "relative" to his organizational sponsor. Put another way, we certify all elements of the user's "business card identity," except his personal name. As a special case, some CAs might undertake to certify the absolute identity of selected users, say the children of wealthy clients, diplomats or national security operatives, almost certainly bolstered with biometric techniques. This would be rare and is presented here only for completeness in order to round out the "relative identity" concept.
Attributes may convey restrictions that control the conditions under which a signature is valid. Without such restrictions, the risk of forgery would be considered excessive, since an electronic signature can be affixed to almost any digital document by anyone possessing the user's smart card and personal identification number (PIN). In the electronic environment, the normal contextual controls of document creation and physical delivery are either weak or nonexistent.
Even authentic users are hardly trustworthy to undertake free-form offline commitments, and organizations will thus welcome the capability to positively restrict the scope of express signature authorization. Such authorization attributes might, in addition to standard X.500 attributes, include Transaction Limits, Cosignature Requirements, Document Types, Authorized Signatories, Geographical and Temporal Controls, Age of Signature, Preapproved Counterparties, Delegation Controls, and Confirm-To Requirement. These attributes can be encoded in one or more authorization certificates signed by the signer's organizational sponsor or by an external CA acting on behalf of the organization. An example of an authorization certificate and an associated transaction is shown in FIG. 5.
When a recipient user (verifier) receives a transaction 51 from a sending user, the recipient first uses the sender's basic key certificate 55 to verify the sender's signature 52 on the transaction 51. As will be described in greater detail below, the recipient also uses the sender's authorization certificate 56, signed by the sender's sponsor 59, to verify the cosignatures 53 and timestamp notarization 54 appended to the transaction 51 and to verify that the attribute values 57 of the transaction 51 fall within the authorized attribute values 58 as specified in the authorization certificate 56.
The user may be subject to transaction limits that control the value of transactions or other documents that the user may initiate. The user's signature will be valid only on transactions originated either up to a certain monetary limit or between two monetary value boundaries. Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 6, the sending user sends a transaction 601 signed 603 by the sender (actually by the user's smart card 600 containing his private key) and appends thereto an authorization certificate 604. The verifier uses the authorization certificate 604 to verify 607 the user's signature 603 and to verify that the transaction monetary value 602 falls within the transaction limit attribute value 605 in the authorization certificate 604. The verifier also verifies 609 the sponsor signature 606 on the authorization certificate 604 using the sponsor's public key 610. If any of these signatures and attribute values does not verify, the transaction is rejected 611. If verification is complete, the transaction is accepted 612.
With regard to cosignature requirements, additional signatures may be required in order for a given signature to be considered valid. Quorum and weighting mechanisms can be used to construct fairly elaborate checks and balances for explicitly governing the level of trust in each user. The particular sequence or order of required signatures may also be specified. Referring to FIG. 7, sending user A sends a transaction 702 signed 703 by his own smartcard 700 and, if user B's cosignature is required on the transaction 702, signed 704 by the smartcard of user B 701. Sending user A also appends his own authorization certificate 705 to the transaction 702. The verifier uses the authorization certificate 705 to verify 711 user A's signature 703, and uses the sponsor's public key 713 to verify 712 the sponsor's signature 707 on the authorization certificate 705; if either signature does not verify, the transaction is rejected 720. If a cosignature value 706 is required 714 by the authorization certificate 705, the recipient enforces the requirement by verifying 715 cosigner user B's signature 704 on the transaction 702, and then checks cosigner user B's public key certificate 708 by verifying 716 the signature 709 of the certificate issuer, using the issuer's public key 717. If the signature of either user B or his certificate's issuer does not verify, the transaction is rejected 722.
The use of cosignatures allows an organization to effectively define checks and balances, and to explicitly specify the level of trust in a user. The use of cosignatures also greatly reduces the risks that result from inadvertent compromise of a private key due to theft, misuse or misplacement of a smartcard or PIN. In particular, it is believed that the ability to require cosignatures, value limits and related controls will enable organizations to carefully manage and fine-tune all signature authorizations, thereby giving them all the tools needed to manage and limit their risks. Use of cosignatures further allows distribution of the authorization function over multiple locations and hardware platforms, with the resultant minimization of risks that might result from access control failures on one of those platforms. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,868,877, 5,005,200 and 5,214,702.
Authorization signatures, which must meet the restrictions specified in the signer's certificate, can also be distinguished from other cosignatures by including the signature purpose as a signature attribute and by requiring that an indication of the signature purpose be included in the data being signed. This signature-purpose attribute might require the values of: (a) an authorization signature appropriate to the document, (b) an authorization cosignature appropriate to the document, where the cosigner's certificate has sufficient authority to authorize the document, and (c) a witness cosignature, where the cosigner's certificate does not by itself have sufficient authority to authorize the document. Signature purpose encodings are discussed in draft ANSI standard X12.58 Version 2 (Appendix) issued by the Data Interchange Standards Association (DISA), which is hereby incorporated by reference.
The user can also be restricted to signing only particular document types, such as ordinary correspondence, purchase orders, specified EDI transaction types, business contracts, specified financial instruments, etc., as defined by industry-wide policies. It may also be desirable for efficiency to exclude certain large classes of transactions and documents. Referring to FIG. 8, the recipient enforces the document-type restriction in the sender's transaction 801 by first verifying 807 the sender's signature 803 on the transaction and by then verifying 808 the document type attribute value 802 within the transaction 801 to enforce the document type restriction 805 within the sender's authorization certificate 804. The recipient then verifies the authorization certificate 804 by using the sponsor's public key 811 to verify 809 the sponsor's signature 806. If either a signature or the attribute restriction does not verify, the transaction is rejected 810.
An organization can indicate that there are specific authorized signatories, that is, that only specific individuals can "sign for" the organization, similar to a standard "corporate resolution" to this effect. This might complement the document-type concept, as an additional control on signing of "corporate" document-types. This restriction can be implemented by specifying that a cosignature is required in which the cosigner's title (in its distinguished name) must be equal to one on a specified list contained in a authorization certificate. This is in lieu of naming a list of one or more required cosigners.
Geographical and temporal controls include locations and time periods from which transactions are considered valid. Use of a local trusted "timestamp notary" is assumed. Such a notary would append a trusted timestamp to the originator's signature on a document and would then sign the result. Thus, time-of-day and day-of-week restrictions would normally coincide with the work-week of the user's locale. Also, location information would be associated with the notary so as to restrict access to a specific network segment, typically the user's assigned work area. The "granularity" of location controls would depend on the network architecture. The signer or the signer's computer system must attach a certified timestamp from a specified local server to the transaction, or else the verifier cannot accept the transaction and the signer's sponsor will not be bound by it. As shown in FIG. 9, the sending user attaches to the transaction 901 an authorization certificate 902, as usual, an authorized timestamp 903 and a time server certificate 904. The recipient verifies 921 the sender's signature 905 on the transaction 901 and verifies 922 the sponsor's signature 908 on the authorization certificate 902. The recipient then (1) verifies 923 that the timestamp transaction text hash 909 matches the result of the text of the transaction 901 hashed with a known hash function, (2) verifies 924 that the time and date 910 on the transaction timestamp 903 fall within the authorized time and date 906 attribute values as specified in the authorization certificate 902, (3) verifies 925 the time server signature 911 on the timestamp 903, and (4) verifies 926 the sponsor's signature 912 on the time server certificate. If all these conditions are satisfied, the transaction is accepted 931; if not, the transaction is rejected 930.
Furthermore, a document may not be valid unless the signature is verified within some specified time period. For high-value transactions this age-of-signature attribute period would be quite short, while for more normal transactions, especially those sent via store-and-forward systems such as X.400, a longer interval (such as two days) would be appropriate. FIG. 10 shows enforcement by a recipient of the age-of-signature attribute value. The time of verification would be provided using a receipt 103 signed by a trusted timestamp service 104 containing, at a minimum, the recipient's name and the signature from the original transaction. The verifier must submit a timestamped copy of the original signature that is dated promptly after the time and date of the original transaction, or else the sponsor will reject it. As shown in FIG. 10, the recipient (verifier) verifies 121 the sender's signature 107 on the transaction 101 and verifies 122 the sponsor's signature 115 on the authorization certificate 102. The recipient then verifies 123 that the difference between the date 105 and time 106 on the transaction 101 and the date 111 and time 112 on the timestamp 103 is within the age-of-signature attribute restriction 108 in the authorization certificate 102. The recipient also verifies 124 that the hash 110 of the transaction 101 within the trusted timestamp 103 matches the text of the transaction 101. If all these conditions are satisfied, the transaction is accepted 130; if not, the transaction is rejected 131.
A "preapproved counterparties" attribute value restricts an entity to dealing only with some specified set of known trustworthy partners. This is a common requirement in dial-up home banking systems, which typically require that all authorized payees be specified in advance. Another way of stating this is that "free-form transfers" are forbidden. Sponsors realize that, in case of an error, they stand a better chance of successfully reversing the error when dealing with a large, solvent and creditworthy party than when dealing with a small, unknown and unauthorized one. Separate certificates can be issued for each counterparty in order to prevent a competitor from obtaining the user's customer list (other than himself) in a single certificate. The approved counterparty can be coded either as a common name, a distinguished name, or the hash value of either the distinguished name or the counterparty's public key. In order to claim the benefit of the transaction, the verifier must submit a certificate that matches the encoded counterparty value.
FIG. 11 shows verification by the user's sponsor of the user's transaction after receipt by a recipient. The recipient (counterparty) verifies 1110 the user's signature 1103 on the transaction 1101 and verifies 1111 the sponsor's signature 1105 on the user authorization certificate 1102. If either of these signatures does not verify, the transaction 1101 is rejected 1112. If the signatures verify and the transaction is accepted 1113 by the recipient, the recipient endorses the transaction 1101 by issuing his verified transaction 1114 counter-signing 1116 the text 1106 of the original user transaction 1101 and the sending user's signature 1103, with the recipient's certificate 1115 attached. In enforcing the preapproved counterparty restriction in the sending user's authorization certificate 1102, the sending user's sponsor verifies 1121 the sending user's signature 1103, as included in the recipient's verified transaction 1114, and verifies 1122 the recipient's signature 1116 thereon. If these signatures are verified, the sponsor next verifies 1123 the counterparty public key hash value by hashing the recipient's public key 1117 and checking the result against one of the authorized counterparty public key hash values 1104 as specified in the user's authorization certificate 1102 (the recipient's public key 1117 that the sponsor hashes for verification is itself verified 1124 when the sponsor verifies the recipient's certificate). If these conditions are met, the transaction is accepted 1125.
The attribute values of delegation controls can limit the types and value ranges of authorizations that a CA may specify when issuing an attribute certificate. They can also serve to limit the scope and depth to which a user may delegate his signing authority to others. For example, a root CA might limit an organizational CA to issuing authorizations only to allow its end users to sign documents whose document types fall into a range of documents related to state tax administration. Or a CA might grant some authority to a user with the provision that it can be delegated only to another person with the rank of assistant treasurer or higher, for a time not to exceed thirty days, and without the right to further subdelegate.
Another authorization attribute, called a "confirm-to requirement" value, prevents the signature from being valid unless the verifier sends a copy of the verified transaction to a third party, typically the user's organizational sponsor or work supervisor, at a specified mail or network address, and either (a) receives an accept/reject message, or (b) a specified time elapses. This requirement is similar to a cosignature but occurs after the transaction is sent rather than before. Such after-the-fact confirmation could be acceptable in lower risk situations in which few transactions would be rejected and in which obtaining the cosignature of the third party in advance may be unduly burdensome. As shown in FIG. 12, the recipient first, as usual, verifies 1211 the sender's signature 1203 on the transaction 1201 and verifies 1212 the sponsor's signature 1205 on the user authorization certificate 1202; if either of these signatures does not verify the transaction 1201 is rejected 1213. If the signatures are verified, the recipient sends 1214 a confirmation message consisting of the original transaction 1201 (the transaction text 1202 and the sending user's signature 1203) to the user's sponsor 1215, as specified 1204 in the sender's authorization certificate 1202. The recipient should receive from the sponsor 1215 the same message in return as confirmation 1216, but signed 1205 by the sponsor. The recipient then verifies 1217 the sponsor's signature 1220 and the confirmation message 1216, and accepts 1219 the transaction 1201.
In order to create complex combinations of restrictions, a filter expression, which is a Boolean or logical expression involving one or more attributes, can allow construction of restrictions involving multiple attributes. The attribute assertions are linked with the usual Boolean connectives: "and", "or" and "not". For example, the sponsor might restrict a user to submitting transaction with a type equal to "purchase order" and a value less than $100,000. Assertions may involve either a single attribute value (equality, less than, greater than, etc.), multiple values of an attribute (subset, superset, etc.), or the presence or absence of an attribute in the document. Of course it will be appreciated that any or any of the described restrictions, as well as others, can be in effect at the same time for the same document or transaction. These restrictions have been discussed and illustrated separately for clarity.
The use of authorization attributes allows a recipient to verify authorization as well as authentication. In such a scenario, the sponsor certificates, anchored by the sponsoring organization's certificate, would be interpreted as authorizing "on sight" the transaction to which they are applied, assuming all specified restrictions are met.
A set of basic policies must be defined for use throughout the financial services industry and other industries in order to provide a well-defined, predictable level of service for the verification process. These policies would be agreed to on a multilateral basis by every participating firm and could stipulate that certain of the restrictions and authorizations discussed in this section would always be deemed to be in effect unless expressly provided otherwise. One of the more important elements of these industry agreements would be the definition and coding of document types. This must be done on a per-industry basis, since the rules will obviously be much different, for instance, for customs inspectors, aircraft inspectors, auditors, tax officials, etc.
Certain authorization attributes may pertain to the specific content of the document itself. This can pose problems for automated machine verification, because the verifier's computer may not always be able to determine the values of such attributes for a given document or transaction. Examples include monetary transaction limits, document types, and security or confidentiality labels. Therefore, it is desirable to provide a standard data block, preferably at the start of the document or the transaction, clearly encoding the attribute, e.g. the stated monetary transaction value, document type or security sensitivity label. This document tag will be appended by the signer's computer for the convenience of the verifier and as an aid to the verification process. However, in the event of a conflict between the tag and the actual content of the document, the language of the document would be controlling. In the case of structured transactions, such as EDI transactions, in which the document types and monetary values are already completely machine readable, document tags would not be needed.
As a possible convenience in processing simple authorizations, especially where a given user signs many similar transactions, it may often be helpful to copy the user's public key out of his basic authentication certificate and include it as another attribute in an authorization certificate. This permits the authorization certificate to serve both purposes (authentication and authorization) and allows the sender to omit the basic authentication certificate from each transaction. In addition, where a device is being relied upon to fulfill a given condition, it may likewise be advantageous to copy the user's device public key into the authorization certificate as well, further eliminating the need to send the device certificate with each transaction.
Additional, useful features of digital signatures, beyond those that can be provided using attribute certificates, involve interaction between a signer and third parties of various types.
One such use for digital signatures is electronic notarization. As discussed above, there will be a need to cosign documents using a third party that is trusted to provide an accurate timestamp and/or location information. Simply relying upon signature originators to provide this information in an accurate fashion leaves signatures vulnerable to fraud based on, for example, pre- or post-dating of documents. An electronic "notary" would be trusted by virtue of its CA's policies to provide this information correctly. The multiple signature capabilities already assumed can be expanded to provide a framework for this service.
For notarization purposes, timestamps and location information will be included as signature attributes. Individual signature structures may either be detached and stored or, if desired, conveyed separately from the document.
Multiple signatures or joint signatures on the document itself can also be distinguished from "countersignatures," which are signatures on the signature structure in which they are found and not on the document itself. A countersignature thus provides proof of the order in which signatures were applied. Because a countersignature is itself a signature structure, it may itself contain countersignatures; this allows construction of arbitrarily long chains of countersignatures. Electronic notarization would then consist of countersigning the originator's signature and including a timestamp within the information being signed. For very high-risk applications it may also be desirable to require multiple signatures on each certificate by one or more CAs, with the signatures being performed in independent cryptographic facilities and with different private keys.
Various levels of service can be defined for electronic notaries based on the level of data verification performed prior to signing (ranging from mere existence of the document, in which case notarization may be completely automatic, to human verification of document content) and based on data retention and audit capabilities.
Another use for digital signatures is for delegation or "power of attorney" certificates. Because users are often tempted to entrust their devices or smartcards to others, for example, secretaries or co-workers, when the users go on vacation, the frequent situation, in which one user obtains another user's smartcard and PIN, exposes the smartcard to possible misuse. The system therefore facilitates the issuance of power of attorney certificates that allow a delegate to associate the signature of his own smartcard with the authority of the delegating user. The power of attorney certificate would include at a minimum the name of the delegator, identification of the delegate's public key certificate and a short validity period, and would be signed by the delegator. Another possibility is for the delegate to create a new key pair exclusively for use with the delegator's signature, with the new public key included in the power of attorney certificate. This would eliminate any potential confusion between use of the delegate's private key on behalf of the delegator and on his own behalf.
The problem of handing over smart cards can be greatly reduced by providing a workable alternative that preserves the principle of individual accountability. Wide implementation of this feature will make practical the disallowance of smartcard loans, a highly desirable goal.
The use of delegation certificates discussed above implies that the user is acting as a CA. In some cases, particularly those in which the transaction crosses organizational boundaries, there may be concern that the level of controls and auditing available with the individual user's cryptographic device (e.g., a smart card) is not sufficient. In such cases, delegation certificates could be issued by a CA upon request of the delegator as normal authorization certificates. This also allows the delegation certificates to be revoked using the standard CRL mechanism. Users' certificates might then indicate a list of possible delegates, and the delegation certificate itself would contain an attribute naming the delegator.
In exercising the power of attorney, a user may indicate that he is signing for another user by including in the document or transaction a "signing-for" signature attribute, i.e., the name of the user being signed for. There must be a valid delegation certificate authorizing the signer to act for the user being signed for. Delegation is also useful in connection with a cryptographic module in a user's personal computer. Hashing and signing a document should ideally be a unitary operation in order to prevent substitution of a false hash via software hacking. However, the typical smartcard lacks the computing power to hash a very long document. One solution is to let the smartcard delegate this function to the cryptographic module using a very short-lived delegation certificate valid for only a few minutes. This certificate is signed by the user's smart card and indicates that the user of the smart card has allowed the delegation. See, for example: Gasser, M., A. Goldstein, C. Kaufman and B. Lampson, "The Digital Distributed System Security Architecture," Proceedings of the 12th National Computer Security Conference, 1989; Gasser, M. and E. McDermott, "An Architecture for Practical Delegation in a Distributed System," Proceedings of the 1990 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.
A more basic problem, however, is ensuring that all possible recipients will actually employ the certificate- and attribute-verification methods described above. Although these methods allow sponsoring organizations to protect themselves, their users and those with whom they transact from liability based upon falsified transactions by allowing them to verify the identity and qualifications of those with whom they transact and the characteristics of the transactions prior to transacting, there is no guarantee that all recipients will actually so verify. If a recipient acts upon a transaction without first verifying the attributes of both the sender and the transaction, and if the sender is later found to have sent a fraudulent or unauthorized transaction, the recipient could then claim liability from the sender or its sponsor by claiming that the recipient was unaware of any requirement for authorization verification of the user's basic signature. One way to ensure that sponsors and other entities are protected from liability in such a situation is to prevent the root key, the public key of the ultimate authority, i.e., the highest-level certifying authority, which key would-be verifiers will need in order to verify any part of a transaction, from being distributed to a user (or to the user's device or smartcard) unless the user contracts with the cryptographic system and agrees to verify all parties and all transactions in accordance with the preestablished rules. In this way, the users are not technically forced to verify all parts of their transactions. However, not verifying their transactions in full would violate the contract between the users and the cryptographic system and would thereby absolve all other parties to the cryptographic system, e.g. a sponsor whose employee acted without authority, from liability. The nonverifying recipient would then bear all the risks of such an unverified transaction himself. Furthermore, because the root key of the system authority is considered a trade secret, no one who has not signed the system rules agreement may possess a copy of it, and no one could claim to have verified any part of the transaction. This art of keeping the system root key as a trade secret lends particular force and effectiveness to all the restriction and authorization methods described herein. It is believed that the possibility of incurring the potentially-large liability for valuable transactions will persuade users to employ the methods of attribute verification of this invention.
Users and organizations must be able to restrict the distribution of all types of certificates for a number of reasons. First, the certificates often contain confidential business information that the user or organization prefers not be shared with others and that is nevertheless being shared with the verifier through the certificate, albeit only for the limited purpose of signature verification. Also, users' basic privacy rights may be violated if their public keys and network addresses are published. For example, they may be flooded with unsolicited business proposals and advertisements once their public keys are disseminated. Furthermore, the organization may have a general policy against giving out user identification numbers and public keys, because they may be used as starting points for various types of security attacks.
This functionality may be implemented in the user's attribute certificate. If the "distribution-restriction" attribute is TRUE, the user/issuer grants permission to use the certificate and its associated public key certificate only for signature verification; distribution or further publication is prohibited. Other ways to specify this restriction might include placing the attribute in the organization's certificate, publishing the restriction as part of the industry-specific policy, or (in a true X.500 implementation) using the X.500 access control list mechanism to restrict casual access to the certificate. Although some existing general legal basis for enforcing this restriction might be found under copyright law, i.e., if the certificate is declared as an unpublished work for which a license is granted only to the named verifier, a firmer legal basis will still be desirable.
There are some additional requirements on smartcards when used with commercial digital signature systems.
The first requirement is private key confinement and self-certification. That is, the user's private signature key must never be allowed to leave the smart card. Only in this way can it be assured that theft of the key cannot be accomplished through purely electronic means without leaving any evidence. This principle of private key confinement is vital to the concept of non-repudiation.
Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 13, when providing a public key 1303 to be certified, the card 1301 must attest that the card 1301 is tamperproof and possesses a key confining design. Proof can be provided via a "device certificate" 1302 stating that the card originates from the specific manufacturer or product line. The public key 1308 of the device 1301 must then be certified by the manufacturer or by a CA designated by the manufacturer. One likely approach to creating this device certificate would be to generate the device key pair during fabrication of the smartcard so that the corresponding device certificate 1302 could also be included on the card. The device certificate 1302 certifies the properties 1304 of the card, and the card generates a key pair 1303,1309 which is to be used by the user of the card and which the user can have certified as his own by any appropriate desired CA. Then, when submitting a newly generated public key 1303 for certification, the device private signature key 1305 would be used to countersign 1306 the certificate request data 1307, which is already signed by the newly-generated user private key 1309.
Also, in a case in which the government requires that all decryption keys be escrowed, the card should be able to certify that it is incapable of decryption. This "signature only" certification can be implemented through the same mechanisms described above, thus allowing the user's signature key to remain exempt from escrow requirements. Because it is doubtful whether an escrowed key retains any value for non-repudiation services, this certification is vital in order to prevent the signature key's disclosure through possible mishandling during an escrow process.
Smartcards should also be required to guard against unauthorized use of personal identification numbers (PINs). Normally, a smartcard is protected against unauthorized use by a PIN, the equivalent of a password. Typically, a PIN is changeable only by the user and must be a specified length, but typically nothing prevents the user from setting the PIN to a trivial number, e.g. all 1's or 121212. Smartcard vendors should be requested to implement PIN-change routines that insure non-trivial PINs without repeating digits or obvious patterns. Making the PIN relatively long (at least 6 digits) and non-trivial reduces the chance that the card can be operated by someone finding or stealing it. Support for a 6-digit PIN requirement can be found in ANSI, "X9.26: Financial Institution Sign-On Authentication for Wholesale Financial Transactions", 1990, which is hereby incorporated by reference and which sets forth the "one-in-a-million" standard that states that a log-in mechanism may be considered secure if, among other things, an attacker has no more than a one-in-a-million chance of guessing the correct password and if the system takes evasive action to prevent repeated guessing. Furthermore, smartcards should be required to take "evasive action", e.g., shutting down for a period of time or even erasing private keys, if too many incorrect PINs are entered by an attempted user.
It could also be made a requirement that smartcard manufacturers use biometrics as more secure methods of identification. Extensive work is currently being done in the areas of voiceprint and fingerprint identification, as a supplement to PINs. However, while the rates of false positive and negative still must be reduced, the main problem lies in securing the biometric input device and its data channel so that they are immune to capture and replay of the biometric data. This is not a problem when the biometric device is embedded in a concrete wall, for example in an ATM or door access system, but it remains a serious problem in typical commercial office settings. Ideally, the card and biometric input device will each be tamperproof cryptographic modules that can certify themselves and establish secure channels with each other.
Smartcards should also be able to maintain an "audit trail," or an internal log of recent actions, containing at a minimum, a timestamp, transaction amount, type code and message digest. This information can be compressed into 40 or so bytes so that a 400-record circular log would consume around 16K bytes. This log would be uploaded and checked only on receipt of a signed request from the card issuer over a secure channel. Also, the card would not delete the old log until it received a signed confirmation from the issuer stating that the uploaded log had been received intact. This control mechanism will deter forgery, reduce the damage that can be caused by a forger, and allow unauthorized or questioned transactions to be investigated more quickly and easily. Since most or all transactions occur off-line from the issuer, the card is the best witness of its own actions.
Thus, a method for securely using digital signatures in a commercial cryptographic system is provided. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention can be practiced by other that the described embodiments, which are presented for purposes of illustration and not limitation, and the present invention is limited only by the claims that follow.

3. To what does the poem compare the snow on the bushes? Make popcorn for your students to eat and pile it in small bowls so that they understand the term “popcorn ball.”
4. Brainstorm comparisons with students that could be used in the poem in place of "popcorn balls." Use realia such as marshmallow, pillows, or cotton balls to help students understand the vocabulary. Have them complete the sentence:
6. Provide them with realia or pictures of possible answers. Responses will depend on their age. Typical replies are cotton balls, fluffy clouds, vanilla ice cream, cream cheese, whipped cream, puffy pillows, and marshmallows.
8. Then have students draw a picture of their simile on the snow ball. Cut the snowball out and have students glue it on dark blue paper. Have them draw snowflakes around the snowball with a white crayon.
Note: To view the classroom activities, you must have Acrobat Reader intalled. Acrobat is a free application available from Adobe Systems.
Snow provides a real reason for beginning ESL students to use their English skills. Here is a sample lesson plan for grades K-3.
Got the winter blahs? Add a few games and puzzles to your winter ESL units. This is a good way to reinforce winter vocabulary and to teach younger children to do word puzzles.

Here are the reviews from the latest J.Crew roll-out. This has been one of my favorites of the year so far. There are a lot of regular-wear classics in it for me like the Popover Oxford Shirt, Linen Shorts and Linen Shirt.
I love that this Tippi has a contrasting striped back and that it’s short-sleeved. I wonder if we will see solid s/s Tippi’s in another roll-out or two? If they had an all stripe like the back of this sweater I would definitely get it. I haven’t changed sizes in the Tippi with the Medium still fitting me well.
This skirt is long for me and I would be better suited in the Petite size. I was shocked to see the skirt was $98 but then I saw the material was 100% Polyester. This would have been much nicer in silk but of course probably raised the price another $100. But, because it’s Poly it’s also machine washable. I like the Berry Print but think I would get tired of wearing it as a top or bottom. I think the Bandana or D’Orsay Pumps are more my style.
I thought the vintage cotton was looser like the tissue tee so I ordered a small in this tee. It’s a cute tee and the wording is embroidered on. It fits well through the body but the arms are a little snug. I was going to exchange it but my store only had two sizes left. I’m hoping it doesn’t shrink when I wash it. And I know you’re thinking “Why don’t you re-order the right size?” And I could but I want to wear this tee now and not wait for the new size to get here. But it is the right thing to do. I hope when I return from my trip that my store will have gotten more sizes so I can exchange it.
I was hoping to get a pretty skirt that I could wear casually this Summer. This one, in the Chambray, was perfect. But I don’t care for the ruffle. I’d prefer a pencil or a-line silhouette. I ordered the 8P for length and it fits well everywhere. I like where the length hits, just at the middle of the knee but I couldn’t get past the ruffle so it was returned. If you order this, take your normal size.
I liked this dress when I saw it online and was happy to see it in my store. Unfortunately, I am not that girl who can casually tie her belt and still look cool. The bottom is visually heavy so I do think you need something in the middle to balance out the hem. The Petite is still going to be long, at 41-inches. If I got this at a crazy sale price I think I would chop off the hem. That would allow me to wear it at my desired length and without the belt. But it’s took cute and I think my size will sell out. I’m saying take your normal size in this dress.
I absolutely loved this dress. I originally saw it at Nordstrom and both the 6 and 8 sold out quickly. I ended up ordering the 8 Petite from J.Crew and found it to be a perfect fit, except for the length. (middle pic) It’s really flattering at that length and I did love it but sitting, dancing or any kind of movement would have hiked up the hem to show a lot more than just my legs. I was relieved that my store had this in black in both the 6 and 8.
I tried the 8 first and it was roomy through the chest and waist. It wasn’t huge by any means but knowing how the 8P fit I knew it would look better a little closer to the body. The size 6 wasn’t as snug as the 8P but still very comfortable and body-hugging. The length hits about an inch above the knee and more appropriate in general. If I had a lot of fun places and events to go to I would have kept the 8P. Though all three sizes fit me I’m going to say to size down one in this dress.

Another way to utilize your talent and business skills is to run corporate workshops online. Businesses are always looking for unique ways to help educate their workforce, and if you can package your talents into a day or half-day long session, you can sell that to companies all over the world to make money online. Start by building a portfolio and then reaching out on LinkedIn to influencers at relevant companies to see if they would be interested in you teaching their team.
If it’s not clear yet, information and expertise are two of the most consistent and lucrative ways to make extra money online. If you don’t like talking on the phone, you can sign up to get paid to answer professional questions on JustAnswer. There are thousands of questions being asked every month from people looking for help from lawyers, doctors, mechanics, vets, and more. To apply, you’ll need to supply your professional verification, resume, and a form of identification.
There are a plethora of training programs and advertisements about how “easy” it is to do medical transcription from home and for profit, but the truth is that it’s not easy at all. You’ll need specific training and classes can cost $3000+. Once you’ve completed the classes, you may find it difficult to find work-from-home transcription opportunities—especially nowadays with plenty of voice-recognition and transcription software out there.
If you are really short on cash and need some immediate funds then you should start by looking around your house. Clear out your cupboards and find any items lying around that you don’t need or haven’t used for a while. Then sell them on eBay. Just because they are gathering dust in your cupboards, doesn’t mean someone else won’t snap them up. Simply sign up with eBay, list your products and then, as they are sold, send them off to the buyers.
Find an audience for your passion or hobby and you’re all set to make money online doing something you love via a niche website. That of course, is easier said than done. Creating a profitable niche website takes time and is not intended for the faint of heart. But, if you can hurdle the steep challenges and positively answer a few key questions on whether the website business idea you’re thinking about is profitable, then you can begin building it and eventually monetize through advertising, affiliates, or other relevant products.
The hardest part in making extra money is always the FIRST STEP in how you can earn extra cash. These tips will serve as a spark for those who are really confused where and when they should start with this financial journey. Making money is not all about intelligence, it is all about making your intellect work for you to have money. It is the wit-the “street-smart” style of approaching things.
If you have previous experience as a computer programmer, or have skills in this field, then there is plenty of work you can pick up as a freelancer. If lack of confidence is holding you back, then Free Code Camp is an excellent way to get your foot in the coding door. This organization provides free courses where you will build real-life apps and programs, giving you experience and plenty to add to your CV.
Writing is a very lucrative online career that can do more than be a side hustle. It’s a good thing the internet is here to stay and here’s why. For like-minded individuals looking to transition smoothly from a cushy day job to a side hustle and turn the side hustle into the full-time job will need to dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to making the “writing side hustle” work for them. While a job is always good to have @ 1st because you need a roof over your head, one should focus more on entrepreneurship and not just having a job to pay the bills. That’s what the employer wants their employees to think and not be their own boss. Side hustles in my personal opinion bring out the best in everyone who makes good of writing online.
Try Uber EATS or DoorDash. Uber EATS offers part-time work that’s similar to driving for Uber or Lyft. Instead of picking up passengers, however, you will pick up food orders and deliver them in your area. Pay works similarly, letting you earn a per-job rate plus tips. Door Dash works similarly, letting consumers order food from restaurants and connecting drivers to pick up and drop off their meals.
Online business is how I’ve made a living since 2003 and what has helped me retire early. I make over $40,000 a month through my blog. You can create your own blog here with my easy 15-minute step-by-step tutorial. You can start a blog for as little as $2.95 a month (less than a cup of coffee!). Create a blog and leverage it into affiliate sales or product endorsement deals. Consider topics like:
The first step is to get your domain. For the loooongest time ever, my blog was known as senseofcents.blogspot.com. I finally bought www.makingsenseofcents.com and haven’t looked back since. I don’t think anyone has ever said “I regret buying my domain and looking more professional.” If you sign up using my Bluehost link, then you will receive your domain for free.
This has become a popular business model for online entrepreneurs over the past several years, and will probably just continue to grow in popularity. The best thing about selling online courses is that once you do the up-front work in creating the course and setting up your marketing strategy, you can get paid over and over again for work you do once.
The market for drones is expanding. Companies hire out work like aerial inspection, photography and land mapping. So if you’re already a drone enthusiast, why not put your aircraft to work? You first need to register it with the Federal Aviation Administration and obtain a license from them for commercial use. Then, you can apply for gigs as a drone pilot. Learn how to start making money with drones.
Not a day goes by that I don’t realize what an amazing privilege it is to be able to work at a job I absolutely love, one I am totally passionate about, and wholly devoted to, one that that gives me flexibility and freedom and one that changes every day. I feel so fortunate to live in a world where opportunities to support our families and make a living are literally right in front of us—right in our own home.
Before I talk about some of the methods for making money online, I wanted to address the role of pain versus pleasure. Every decision that we make in life is weighed on a pain-versus-pleasure scale. We will always do more to avoid pain than we will to gain pleasure, plain and simple. However, this is also what holds us back from succeeding in any endeavor.
Sell plasma. After passing an initial screening, you can usually sell your plasma for anywhere from $25 to $50 per donation. To qualify, you’ll have to stand in a long line or show up early, be willing to fill out a very personal questionnaire, and endure a painful needle prick or two. Still, selling plasma is a great way to raise money fast – if you can stand the hassle.
This isn’t quick money, but you can make decent money with a little luck and solid, consistent effort. Believe me, it can be tough and a bit time consuming, but it can be done. I started PT Money in 2007 and since then the site has grown considerably, now viewed more than 200,000 times per month. The key to blogging is to have a long-term goal of making extra money in mind. You can get started by reading my article on how to make money blogging.
It shows your true ignorance by calling someone an idiot. In no way was this thread used to alienate anyone, but merely having a heated discussion of professions and their importance. If you didn’t read my comment correctly, I said…”for example.” I know the difference between graphic design and being a surgeon. Those of you who are obviously majorly left-brained will never understand the creative industry. You’re right, anyone can be a bad designer, or a bad surgeon, or a bad accountant coordinator…etc. That’s why there exists terrible brand identities, malpractice suits, etc as well. All I was saying that the creative industry shouldn’t be held below the threshold of what is real and what is a fake profession. All professions should be respected in their own right. Period.
The Ibotta app gives you cash back on the groceries you already buy. Some deals are brand specific, while others give you cash just for purchasing a certain type of item, like a loaf of bread from any brand. Choose your deals before you check out, then submit a picture of your receipt and get paid via Venmo, PayPal, or gift cards. Sign up with Ibotta to claim your $10 welcome bonus.
Sell stock photos. Stock photos are simple, somewhat nondescript images that people can use for a fee in articles, brochures, presentations, etc. They don’t earn much apiece, but if you upload a nice little collection, the sales can really add up – especially since photos can be sold over and over. Best of all, it doesn’t get much easier than clicking off a few decent shots, uploading them, and waiting.
Join a startup accelerator: Another great option is to apply to a startup accelerator like Y Combinator, 500 startups, or TechStars, where a group of investors will help coach you, connect you with potential partners, and provide startup cash in return for a small stake in your company. The competition is tough to get into these, so don’t rely on them as your only path forward.
Your Deals. In addition to establishing a per-class price, also offer packages to entice people to sign up for more than one class. For example, if you intend to host classes on making soap, offer the classes individually, as well as in a group. Someone could take a class learning how to use fresh flowers in homemade soap, or they could buy a bundle that teaches them how to use those, fresh herbs, and plastic toys for kid’s soap. However you decide to price your classes, remember that the buyer will want to feel like they’re getting a lot for their money. If you can provide that in a fun atmosphere, they’ll likely be back time and time again – and they’ll bring friends.
Become a proofreader. All kinds of businesses hire professional proofreaders to look over their copy and content for errors before they publish. This side hustle is one that could work for nearly anyone since you can work from home provided you have a computer and an internet connection. You can find online proofreading jobs through websites like Indeed.com and FlexJobs.com
If my piece of content is so unique and valuable around hiking backpack recommendations, that other reputable outdoor websites are willing to link to it and build the page’s authority, then I’d have a very real opportunity to rank high in organic search for these search terms (meaning, my page will come up first when someone searches for hiking backpacks).
Basketball is also similar to poker in this way -- I am right now working on my jump shot and I think I will need to shoot at least another 100, 000 shots before I will be confident with my jumper. Practice makes perfect.

2:23 Peter Shilton was impressed by Jordan Pickford's crucial penalty save against Colombia in the World Cup
England have their best chance in decades to lift the World Cup, having fallen short in the semi-finals in 1990, and the nation's media are getting into a frenzy. The victory left revelers in Montreal's Burgundy Lion feeling pretty good - though the liquid refreshments may have helped.
Schmeichel praised the sheer variety of England set piece play, which has turned into a "serious weapon" for them at Russian Federation 2018 - three-fourths of their goals have come from the dead ball - and reserved special praise for the scorer of the opener in Samara.
Of those who did show up at his restaurant on Saturday, there was one table of Sweden fans who came in, only to witness the loss to England.
"I'm so, so proud of what all of the players and all of the staff have done because we've got to this point because the collective has been so strong".
In a press conference ahead of the Players, renowned gambling fan Mickelson called out Woods for a big-money match. However, the negotiations between the two players, TV networks and sponsors didn't get done in time.
"Is the World Cup any different? No, not really. You can say that, but when players are also working as electricians and stuff like that, it's still pressure".
"A lot of people think I am only young, but it is my second season in the Premier League, and I do not feel as if I am far away from guys like that [Courtois]". That was the hard task.
'Playing in those big games is something special and it gives you confidence to know that you can perform at the very, very top against the best players in the world and I've just tried to continue that with England'. I don't care if I'm not the biggest keeper because it's about being there in the moment and making the save, and I was.

The main goal of the DSM-TP International Summer School, is the creation of a space for learning and discussion about Domain Specific Modeling.

The pistol shrimp can deliver an explosive attack hotter than the surface of the sun and loud enough to rupture a human ear drum.
Finding unique, memorable and compelling ways to emphasize what is most unique about you, your product or your service is the hallmark of great marketing.
In this example, the fast-casual restaurant chain, Chipotle Mexican Grill, added some spice to its long-running “Food With Integrity” sustainable farming campaign by teaming with Academy Award-winning design firm Moonbot Studios for The Scarecrow, an animated short film and accompanying mobile game created to increase consumer awareness of animal confinement, synthetic growth hormones, toxic pesticides and other fixtures of industrial food production.
Combine George Orwell-esque dystopia with Willie Wonka theme music, create a cute little Scarecrow character and – voila! – 6.5million YouTube views unfold in less than two weeks!
Of course, this is a big budget project that few can afford. But what you MUST do, is know what your core values are (for Chipotle one of them is sustainability and another is feeding people healthy food), know what your promise is (at Chipotle it’s ‘Food with Integrity’, and know what your brand personality is all about (Chipotle’s ad tugs at the heart while still being a little tongue-in-cheeek).

Network systems and data communications analysts saw a significant increase of more than 50 percent from a year ago.
The market for IT jobs in Manhattan and Westchester County, N.Y., is showing signs of improvement, according to the latest Pace University SkillProof IT Index report. The PSII registered 114 in Manhattan for the first quarter of 2012, more than 7 percent higher than 106 registered in the fourth quarter of 2011 and better than 2 percent from a year ago. It registered 186 in Westchester, more than 18 percent above 158 in the fourth quarter of 2011 and nearly 1 percent higher than the index of 185 a year ago.
Data on the national labor market is up, as is the labor market data in Manhattan and Westchester, while the national unemployment rate is down to 8.2 percent, the researchers noted. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of people who were employed marginally or part time dropped by over 10 percent in the last three months. This phenomenon is significant for IT professionals because of their various employment options, including part-time and private consulting opportunities.
In Manhattan, of the 11 categories of IT professionals tracked by PSII, six increased, three significantly and three moderately. The additional five categories remained flat on a quarterly basis, but four declined sharply relative to a year ago. Demand for computer scientists in research was up 79 percent, reversing its annual negative trend.
The presumed jobless economic recovery in the U.S. is finally reversing itself as the labor market picks up steam, according to the researchers led by Farrokh Hormozi, an economist and chair of the public administration department at Paces Dyson College of Arts and Sciences. Although the March report on job creation was disappointing, the number of jobs exceeded the economists benchmark of 240,000.
Demand for computer support specialists and database administrators continued to increase, growing by more than 30 percent on a quarterly basis and rising by more than 50 percent annually. The market for software engineers, systems and computer systems analysts remained flat on a quarterly basis, while network systems and data communications analysts saw a significant increase of more than 50 percent from a year ago.
As the economy starts to grow, IT hiring in support roles should increase, said Jean Hill, chief technology officer at First New York Securities, writing in a sidebar of the report. Almost every working professional uses technology in some form to perform their duties. Accordingly, technology and good technical support are no longer luxuries but rather necessities. Firms are investing in IT but in very different ways than in the past. As we come out of the recession, telecommuting and virtual offices are replacing the traditional office/cubicle environment. Technologists who understand their industry and the changing business environment and can translate that information into actionable technology plans will be in great demand.

The CTIA Wireless IT & Entertainment 2009 fall trade show was held at the San Diego Convention Center Oct. 7-9. Here, Knowledge Center mobile and wireless analyst J. Gerry Purdy shares his major insights from CTIA, including his reactions to Motorola's new CLIQ Android smartphone and Motorola's MOTOBLUR software, as well as Microsoft's Windows Mobile 6.5, MyPhone and Windows Mobile Marketplace announcements.
The CTIA Wireless IT & Entertainment trade show was originally designed to focus on data, while the annual CTIA Wireless conference focused on voice. They have tried for many years to have the CTIA fall event cater to two groups at the same time-enterprise and consumers-since most wireless data vendors have products designed for either one or both of these markets. But the times have changed. Now, most people just think of CTIA as having two trade shows a year: spring in Las Vegas and fall, typically in San Francisco. They should just call them CTIA Spring and CTIA Fall, respectively.
It was clear last fall in San Francisco that the economy was hurting, with "down attendance" at the show. The decrease in attendees continued at this event a couple of weeks ago, with the conference taking up only one third of the convention center-and half of the space that was taken was set aside for the (more valuable) meeting rooms. You always think of a trade show as having lots of flashy booths. The meeting room areas were better for meetings: they were quiet and had a table and chairs.
1. Motorola is clearly back in the mobile game with the introduction of the CLIQ Android smartphone and their software called MOTOBLUR.
3. A number of speech-to-text companies are demonstrating that speech recognition for mobility is clearly now set to go mainstream.
It wasn't that long ago (2005 and 2006) that Motorola was the darling of the cellular industry. "Candybar" phones from Nokia were thick and heavy. Then, out of nowhere, Motorola developed the ultrathin RAZR feature phone and everyone just had to be seen using one. What a difference a few years makes. By mid-2007, the iPhone, plus a plethora of other popular smartphones, pushed the RAZR into oblivion. With no clear follow-on strategy (other than to introduce more variants of RAZR and a few Windows Mobile devices), Motorola looked like it was an "also ran."
There are some really good people who work at Motorola. They have as much experience developing phones as anyone, so you'd expect them to come back and offer something that would be on par-or perhaps better-than the iPhone and the rest of the smartphone manufacturers. Motorola recently announced the CLIQ, a smartphone based on the Google Android operating system. While the phone is nice, it's clearly the MOTOBLUR software that puts CLIQ back into the running for leadership in the phone market.
Updated: The battle between Microsoft's OpenXML format and the OpenDocument Format intensifies as Microsoft attacks the newly created OpenDocument Format Alliance.
Microsoft is accusing some competitors of exactly the same thing of which they have criticized the software company: pushing an exclusive standard to the detriment of all others and not enabling choice.
These sharp words from Microsoft follow the formation last week of the OpenDocument Format Alliance, a coalition of more than 35 organizations from across the world whose goal is to enable governments to have direct management and greater control over their documents.
The alliance—whose supporters include many of Microsofts Linux and open-source foes such as Corel, IBM, Novell, OpenOffice.org, Opera Software, Oracle, Red Hat and Sun Microsystems—is essentially positioning the XML-based ODF (OpenDocument Format) as the alternative to other document formats like Microsofts OpenXML, which is the new file format that will be used in Office 2007 when it ships later this year.
/zimages/6/28571.gifClick here to read how the new OpenXML file format could significantly slow the adoption of Office 2007.
Alan Yates, general manager of Microsofts Information Worker Business Strategy in Redmond, Wash., this week accused the alliance, which he referred to as "Sun, IBM and their friends," of wanting to push the ODF as an "exclusive" standard to the detriment of all others, rather than enabling choice among formats like PDF from Adobe, Microsofts OpenXML and HTML.
"Clearly, choice and competition are better than arbitrary technology preferences. Part of this confusion is clearly IBM and Sun promoting their products based on OpenOffice that have had difficulty competing in the marketplace thus far," Yates said.
The important long-term issue is how documents can integrate with information systems via XML, he said, adding, "It is great that there is competition to help customers into this new era of open, XML-based documents."
Simon Phipps, Suns chief open-source officer, agrees that choice and competition are clearly preferable, which is why standards exist for mature product categories, so that vendors have a baseline and can compete on implementations rather than competing on incompatible "standards," he told eWEEK.
The ODF Alliance is only interested in one baseline, extensible standard for editable documents, just like the one standard for Web pages—HTML—and the one standard for sharing noneditable documents—PDF, he said.
"That baseline is OpenDocument, widely implemented, truly open and unencumbered, compatible with .doc, managed openly at OASIS and currently under vote as an ISO standard. … As history proves, only monopolists fear baseline standards that give their customers true choice," Phipps said.
For his part, Bob Sutor, the vice president of standards and open source for IBM, said Microsofts accusation that the supporters of the OpenDocument Format are somehow limiting choice is "ridiculous."
In a post to his blog, he said that "theyve tried this line before. It was ridiculous then, and its ridiculous now. Give us a break, customers are really smarter than that," he said.
Its an insult to ODF and the OASIS process for Microsoft to claim that whats going on in ECMA is "open" or even just as open as the process under which ODF was created and is being enhanced, he said.
The alliance is also concerned by the fact that, as technologies continue to rapidly evolve, documents are created by public-sector agencies using different applications that may not be compatible with one another today, let alone into the future.
As such, a broad cross-section of associations, academic institutions, and industry and related groups saw the need to join together to promote open solutions to this problem, the alliance said.
"Through the use of a truly open standard file format that can be implemented by numerous and varied applications, the Alliance seeks to enable governments and their constituents to use, access and store critical documents, records and information both today and in the future, independent of the applications or enterprise platforms used for their creation or future access," the Alliance said in a statement announcing its formation.
The OpenDocument Format Alliance also claims that ODF is the only established open-standard document format, and that it enables the retrieval of information and exchange of documents between different applications, agencies and/or business partners in a platform- and application-independent way.

The story of Captain D. Michael Abrashoff and his command of USS Benfold has become legendary inside and outside the Navy. Now Abrashoff offers this fascinating tale of top-down change for anyone trying to navigate today's uncertain business seas. When Captain Abrashoff took over as commander of USS Benfold, a ship armed with every cutting-edge system available, it was like a business that had all the latest technology but only some of the productivity. Knowing that responsibility for improving performance rested with him, he realized he had to improve his own leadership skills before he could improve his ship. Within months he created a crew of confident and inspired problem-solvers eager to take the initiative and take responsibility for their actions. The slogan on board became "It's your ship," and Benfold was soon recognized far and wide as a model of naval efficiency. How did Abrashoff do it? Against the backdrop of today's United States Navy-Benfold was a key player in our Persian Gulf fleet-Abrashoff shares his secrets of successful management including: See the ship through the eyes of the crew: By soliciting a sailor's suggestions, Abrashoff drastically reduced tedious chores that provided little additional value. Communicate, communicate, communicate: The more Abrashoff communicated the plan, the better the crew's performance. His crew would eventually call him "Megaphone Mike," since they heard from him so often. Create discipline by focusing on purpose: Discipline skyrocketed when Abrashoff's crew believed that what they were doing was important. Listen aggressively: After learning that many sailors wanted to use the GI Bill, Abrashoff brought a test official aboard the ship-and held the SATs forty miles off the Iraqi coast. From achieving amazing cost savings to winning the highest gunnery score in the Pacific Fleet, Captain Abrashoff's extraordinary campaign sent shock waves through the U.S. Navy. It can help you change the course of your ship, no matter where your business battles are fought.
A former U.S. Navy commander draws on interviews with leaders from every branch of the U.S. military and the business world to discuss how to honor agreements with a staff, develop employees, and work on one's own terms.
The story of Captain Abrashoff and his command of USS Benfold has become legendary inside and outside the Navy. By governing his ship with his unique management techniques, Abrashoff turned the Benfold into a model of naval efficiency, with amazing cost savings, the highest gunnery score in the Pacific Fleet, and a highly motivated and top performing crew. In IT'S YOUR SHIP, he first demonstrated how to bring his successful management techniques from the ship to the boardroom. Now, in his newest book IT'S OUR SHIP, in the same rugged, can-do voice, Abrashoff will focus on the leadership, motivational, and management insights and tips that he has learned from his last six years of addressing business and corporate audiences. Abrashoff's timely advice will be eminently prescriptive, and will feature anecdotes and insights from leaders of businesses large and small and from public and non-profit sectors.

“One of the 12 best business books of all time…. Timeless principles of empowering leadership.” – USA Today Since Turn the Ship Around! was published in 2012, hundreds of thousands of readers have been inspired by former Navy captain David Marquet’s true story. Many have applied his insights to their own organizations, creating workplaces where everyone takes responsibility for his or her actions, where followers grow to become leaders, and where happier teams drive dramatically better results. Marquet was a Naval Academy graduate and an experienced officer when selected for submarine command. He faced a new wrinkle when he was assigned at the last minute to the Santa Fe, a nuclear powered submarine that he hadn't been trained for. Facing the high-stress environment of a sub where there’s little margin for error, he was determined to reverse the trends he found: poor morale, poor performance, and the worst retention rate in the fleet. Almost immediately, Marquet ran into trouble when he unknowingly gave an impossible order, and his crew tried to follow it anyway. When he asked why, the answer was “Because you told me to.” Marquet realized that while he had trained for a different submarine, his crew had been trained to do what they were told -- a deadly combination. So Marquet flipped the leadership model and began to push for leadership at every level. Turn the Ship Around! reveals how the Santa Fe skyrocketed from worst to first in the fleet by challenging the Navy’s traditional leader-follower approach. Struggling against his own instincts to take control, he instead achieved the vastly more powerful model of giving control to his subordinates. Before long, each member of Marquet’s crew became a leader and assumed responsibility for everything he did, from clerical tasks to crucial combat decisions. The crew became fully engaged, contributing their full intellectual capacity every day. The Santa Fe set records for performance, morale, and retention. And over the next decade, the officers of the Santa Fe were selected to become submarine commanders in highly disproportionate numbers. Whether you need a major change of course or just a tweak of the rudder, you can apply Marquet’s methods to turn your own ship around.

For 20 years, the Great Place to Work® Institute has been developing the annual ranking of the best companies to work for in the US and in 39 countries around the world. In the US, the ranking is published by FORTUNE and is best known as the FORTUNE 100 Best Companies to Work For. In 2010, the list included among its finalists: SAS, Google, REI, Scripps Health, Hoar Construction, DreamWorks Animation, Zappos.com, Salesforce.com, Cisco, Marriott Interntional, American Express, Mayo Clinic, Microsoft. Drawing on the Institute's wide and deep body of knowledge acquired in the process of producing this ranking, Institute senior consultant Michael Burchell and research fellow Jennifer Robin reveal that what separates the great from the good companies to work for is the leader's ability to create Trust, Pride and Camaraderie in their companies. THE GREAT WORKPLACE explains the concept of a Great Place to Work--defined as one in which employees trust the people they work for, have pride in what they do, and enjoy the people they work with--and demystifies the Institute's Great Place to Work model, developed in 1984 and validated through its enduring resonance in both the United States and in 40 countries around the world. It also answers the fundamental question, "What is the business value of creating a great workplace?" and brings the definition of a Great Place to Work alive with anecdotes, best practices, and quotes from employees working at the best workplaces in the US (and ranked in the list). Companies featured in the book include: General Mills, Google, Gore, Microsoft, PricewaterhouseCoopers, SAS, Scripps Health, Wegman's and S.C. Johnson. As organizations grapple with the complexity and challenges of leveraging human capital in today's hyper-competitive work world—and as the Institute increases its presence across the world—THE GREAT WORKPLACE will be the "must read" source for understanding the essential ingredients in and trends of great places to work.
In Turn the Ship Around! (Portfolio, 2013), former U.S. Navy Captain David Marquet introduced a bold new approach to leadership, based on his experiences turning around the troubled submarine USS Santa Fe. Now Marquet returns with a workbook so readers can apply his methods to their own organisations. With extensive questions and exercises on how to delegate and inspire, this workbook will help readers build a work community based on personal responsibility and trust.

Established in 2006, the American Association of Blacks in Higher Education (AABHE), formerly constituted as the Black Caucus (American Association of Higher Education), has been the consistent voice of Black issues in academe. According to the stated mission, the AABHE pursues the educational and professional needs of Blacks in higher education with a focus on leadership, equity, access, achievement and other vital issues impacting students, faculty, staff, and administrators. AABHE also facilitates and provides opportunities for collaborating and networking among individuals, institutions, groups and agencies in higher education in the United States and internationally. This 2012 year will mark the beginning of the AABHE research consortium, an arm of the organization that will advance scholarly research and publications to highlight critical issues pertinent to the success and uplift of Black populations across the higher education diaspora. This book will explore important issues across multiple fields—fields represented by the scholars/members of AABHE. AABHE scholars will contribute chapters based on their disciplinary expertise. The work of Earnest Boyer as articulated in the book Faculty Priorities Reconsidered: Rewarding Multiple Forms of Scholarship will be used as the conceptual foundation to ground this important work. A particular focus on the elements of Boyer’s seminal work will include chapters devoted to the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning; Scholarship of Engagement; Scholarship of Discovery; and Scholarship of Integration. This scholarly book is unique in that it provides essential insight on how not only faculty, but also administrators who are invested in insuring that the priorities of the professoriate are aligned with the mission and vision of urban postsecondary institutions.
There generally remains a gulf between the way most Black faculty perceive the racial climate at their institutions and the recognition by non-Black faculty and administrators that there are problems and that these perceptions have merit. This book is intended to promote a productive dialogue. This book weaves the authors' own experiences with the responses of 136 Black faculty to a questionnaire, and a smaller sample who were interviewed, to identify the factors that determine Black faculty's satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their jobs and institutions. Recurring themes underscore the importance of a supportive work environment that is built on mutual respect, full inclusion in the decision-making process, and an institutional climate that does not tolerate cultural insensitivity or racism. The qualitative and quantitative information and the authors' conclusions can help postsecondary institutions improve Black faculty satisfaction levels, and ultimately, retention rates. This book will resonate with any Black faculty who have felt frustrated enough to consider leaving a postsecondary institution and with those who are content at their current institutions. For non-Black faculty and for administrators of all races, the book illuminates the sources of job satisfaction and dissatisfaction, explains the reasons their Black colleagues leave or stay, and offers valuable recommendations for change. For anyone, at any level, interested in the issue of the racial climate at his or her institution, this book offers a constructive framework for discussion and action
Why is it that so many efforts by liberals to lift the black underclass not only fail, but often harm the intended beneficiaries? In Please Stop Helping Us, Jason L. Riley examines how well-intentioned welfare programs are in fact holding black Americans back. Minimum-wage laws may lift earnings for people who are already employed, but they price a disproportionate number of blacks out of the labor force. Affirmative action in higher education is intended to address past discrimination, but the result is fewer black college graduates than would otherwise exist. And so it goes with everything from soft-on-crime laws, which make black neighborhoods more dangerous, to policies that limit school choice out of a mistaken belief that charter schools and voucher programs harm the traditional public schools that most low-income students attend. In theory these efforts are intended to help the poor—and poor minorities in particular. In practice they become massive barriers to moving forward. Please Stop Helping Us lays bare these counterproductive results. People of goodwill want to see more black socioeconomic advancement, but in too many instances the current methods and approaches aren’t working. Acknowledging this is an important first step.
Harm de Blij contends in this book that geography continues to hold us all in an unrelenting grip and that we are all born into natural and cultural environments that shape what we become, individually and collectively.
Validation—recognizing and accepting your child’s thoughts and feelings, regardless of whether or not you feel that your child should be experiencing them—helps children develop a lifelong sense of self-worth. Children who are validated feel reassured that they will be accepted and loved regardless of their feelings, while children who are not validated are more vulnerable to peer pressure, bullying, and emotional and behavioral problems. The Power of Validation is an essential resource for parents seeking practical skills for validating their child’s feelings without condoning tantrums, selfishness, or out-of-control behavior. You’ll practice communicating with your child in ways that instantly impact his or her mood and help your child develop the essential self-validating skills that set the groundwork for confidence and self-esteem in adolescence and beyond. “...There is valuable advice here. This approach takes mindfulness, patience, and a long-term vision, but parents who are able to help their children trust their emotional landscapes will have an easier time of scaffolding to higher reasoning, in addition to more secure relationships with their youngsters. Highly recommended.” —Library Journal, STARRED REVIEW, Rebecca Raszewski, University of Illinois Library, Chicago

In the last decade, industry and academy have been looking at Model Driven Development (MDD) as an interesting approach to fight accidental complexity in system development, and to simulate models and understand their relations. In this regard, models and model transformations, expressed in appropriate formalisms, are seen as construction tools rather than just documentation. Models are the essential artifact to abstract everything and in this perspective one should strive to Model Everything.
On the one hand the industry lately has been reporting numerous examples where the use of MDD and the design of dedicated formalisms (Domain Specific Languages) for Model specification are success cases, especially in Software Product Lines. There is a wide range of application Domains: Interactive Systems, Real-Time Systems, Web 2.0 design, Business Architecture, Games, Industrial Automation, Hardware and Software Co-design, Mechatronics, Business Modeling, Requirements Engineering, or even Process Design. On the other hand, academy has been investing in this emerging field by developing foundations, systematic approaches, tools and frameworks that support Simulation and Verification, Model Checking and Model-Based Testing to bring it to a mature stage.
It has been difficult for practitioners, regular Software Engineers, to keep the pace of the evolution and be acquainted with this field. There is a wide set of tools and techniques available but no integrated vision of MDD. The community acknowledges the lack of forums to educate and present MDD in a comprehensive way.
From the above said, the 5th International Summer School on Domain Specific Modeling - Theory and Practice seeks to draw researchers, teachers, practitioners, and students (at MSc. or PhD. level) who intend to study or work with Domain Specific Modeling. The purpose is to learn principles and practices in a friendly and convivial environment. The lecturers are a mixed set of experienced professionals in the topic from both academic and industrial background.
The first two days of this Summer School are structured in several introductory classes to theoretical topics of DSMs and hands-on tutorials where techniques and tools will be explained and used. There will be a common Case Study to all the lectures and tutorials in order to have a continuous guideline among them, instead of isolated thematic talks. The fourth and fifth days will be dedicated to given an overall picture both from both the academic and industrial point of view of the most recent advances in the field highlighting the current research as well as discussing challenges and open issues.

Hokay, you've seen many a tee-vee show like LAWBREAKER o'er the years whether it be via one of those AMERIGA'S MOST WANTED and COPS on-the-scene-as-it-happens reality programs that have cluttered up the cathodes these past thirtysome years...series that were part documentary and part drama with everyone from the victims and arresting ossifers to the crimnuls themselves taking part in the on-screen festivities. But LAWBREAKER was way better 'n any of these if only because it came out during the fab '63-'64 tee-vee season (first year for THE OUTER LIMITS and FIREBALL XL-5, last year for THE TWILIGHT ZONE) which was just as good as '62-'63 and '64-'65 and even better'n '75-'76 which was the last good season with regards to the kinda tee-vee we all like! Yeah, back then tee-vee really was attuned to the fun and action-addled minds of people like us, and a show like this really kept up glued to the boob tube when we could have been doing less culturally dutiful things like our homework, singing folk songs, going on freedom rides and all of those noble activities that I guess people in 1963 were doing which in the long run look pretty silly if you ask me!
's kinda hard to describe this 'un...host and narrator Lee Marvin (who had a pretty busy time during the '63-'64 season what with not only here but with appearances on THE TWILIGHT ZONE and GREAT ADVENTURE) spends the entire series in what looks like a stripped down television control booth describing to us the criminals and acts at hand while the story is being played out before our very eyes, sometimes by the actual victims and officers themselves doing some of the best one-D stiff acting imaginable. (Sheesh, you'd at least think that those teenage gals in Pittsburgh who were kidnapped woulda shown some real emote on-screen like they obviously must've in real life!!!) Many times Marvin interviews the criminals themselves from the prison where they always seem to be so contrite and embarrassed by it all...one can only wonder if it is because they are that contrite or because these killers and thieves think that if they put up a good front their sentences are gonna be reduced. Whatever, when you put the re-enactments, interviews and Marvin's hard-edged hosting abilities together you get one of them shows that really woulda hooked ya to the point where you'd most definitely quit the bowling league if this just happened to be on the same night in those pre-VCR days.
Most of LAWBREAKER does have that raw DRAGNET-styled sense of urgency. Marvin plays it his natural cool and tough self throughout (I guess he hadda do something to counterbalance the at-times grade-zilchville acting from the real-life participants) whether talking about the search for a rare blood type donor or high school kids stabbing each other just for kicks. The stories are seat-gluing and at times unbelievably gruesome like the one from Rochester where some teenage gal was molested and murdered by some kiddie diddler who just hadda remark that there's one like him in every town! Sheesh, no wonder the neighbors keep eyeing me like that!
Even creepier is the one from Long Beach California where these always on the move criminals are running an abortion racket with one dead victim getting bagged and tossed in a viaduct and an actual woman who had one talking behind a screen about her experience. Since this woman is identified as being an actress I kinda wonder just who the gal who slipped the sucker was...it is hard to discern because her face is hidden and the voice can't be placed and as usual so trying to put the sparse clues together is just driving me crazy! Just hope it ain't someone I used to like such as that lady who used to give out Hostess cakes to the kids from a Dutch door that used to run when I was but a mere turdler!
But what really is striking about this particular episode is that, years later, none other'n Marvin was called out by former palimony squeeze Michele Triola because back when the two were an item he allegedly forced her into getting a couple of uterine slurpers! During the palimony trial Triola was crying and moaning to the press about her shame and guilt over them, and after watching this 'un I woulda kinda thought that Marvin mighta learned something about the emotional effects abortions can have on those who get 'em. But obviously...he didn't.
Well, it still is kinda hard to get through my bean that the actor on the screen is playing a role and that a certain role most certainly will differ from movie to tee-vee show, totally forgetting that real life most certainly ain't acting one bit. After all, I remember the Skipper talking to Gilligan in that RESCUE FROM GILLIGAN'S ISLAND special about how there actually are good movies being made and they don't need to have any nudity in them to succeed, explaining this with all of the solemn heartfelt emote that Hardy must have used when explaining the facts of life to Laurel. The funny thing is that Alan Hale Jr. previously acted in the recommended modern-western update THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN which had some boob flashes innit, and that single role seems to have blown the fambly-type entertainment roles Hale was known for right out the porthole of the Minnow ifyaknowaddamean... Sheesh, ya can't trust even yer faves anymore!
And, of course, at the end of each LAWBREAKER the chief of police of whatever town the show takes place in appears from his desk to read a pre-prepared encapsulation about the crime and the police work that was done with all the conviction of a fourth grader standing in front of the class with a report on the tapioca crop in Guyana. What better way could you think of capping a show that goes from hard-knuckled narration to drama to documentary without you even realizing it???
Chris, Glad you are bringing attention to this amazing series. I didn't remember it AT ALL (although it before I was even in Kindergarten, so my parents would probably have kept me away from it), but I did get this DVD set as you did, and it was mind-blowing. Did Lee Marvin have a huge divorce settlement to pay off? Did he have big gambling debts? Hard to believe that a major star would appear in something this cheesy. It is certainly an extension of his M SQUAD and general tough-guy persona, and anyone who loves Lee Marvin, will go ape-shit over this show!
First of all, that odd TV screen "frame" through which parts of the show are seen...and the odd "control room" where Marvin does his narrations from.
I also love the way that some of the police officials and characters pretend to be talking to Lee Marvin.
Of course, Lee Marvin could read the phone book and be convincing and entertaining, and this kind of gruff hard-boiled crime content is made-to-order for Marvin's delivery.
This show is SO MUCH better than the reality-tv crime things that have been on for the last 25 years. It's kind of like a low-budget hard boiled crime film, but directed by Larry Buchanan and hosted by Lee Marvin.
BTC fans should run, not walk, to their computer and do an online order for this show ASAP. It's provided me with hours and hours of hard-boiled "real people" entertainment from a period when REAL old-school crime films and TV shows were still being made. It's as uncomfortable and awkward and tawdry as real life!

Strawberries are attacked by a variety of pests, including insects, mites, pathogens and weeds. While much of this publication deals with chemical controls, the best overall approach to pest management integrates chemicals with other methods. Where possible, cultural practices that may help in managing these pests are presented.
The single most important factor in controlling pathogens is the maintenance of vigorously growing plants. Weeds compete with strawberries for essential water and nutrients. Weeds also promote pest injury by acting as alternate ‘homes’ for diseases and insects, inhibiting spray penetration, and maintaining high humidity in the strawberry leaf canopy.
Good soil and air drainage are essential for plant health. Roots rot quickly in waterlogged soil, and fruit rots are more common when the soil surface does not dry quickly. Well-drained loams are the most suitable soil types for good root penetration and plant growth. Sites where cold air can drain away to lower levels will decrease the possibility of frost damage to the flowers and fruit. A southern, sloping site is the most ideal location providing quick-drying soil and earlier ripening berries.
For good root penetration, aeration and drainage, organic materials should be added to the soil. Disc animal manures, compost, and/or green manure crops (cover crops) thoroughly into the soil before planting. The use of leguminous cover crops may increase soil nematode populations, which may be injurious to strawberries. Sudan grass (which will suppress nematode populations) and Japanese millet are annual cover crops well suited for most situations, providing heavy organic matter production. See section on “Cover Crops and Green Manures” on page 8 for more on this subject. If poultry manure is used, it must be applied cautiously. It is a rich source of nitrogen and phosphorus which, if used to excess, can promote excessive vegetative growth and soft berries (both conditions encourage disease), and may leach into ground water.
In new beds, a soil test should be done to determine the pH, and the rate and types of fertilizer to apply. Have the soil tested at your state university or private soil-testing lab and apply the necessary lime to adjust the pH to within the range of 5.8 to 6.2. Some soils low in magnesium may benefit from the use of dolomitic (Hi-Mag) lime. Pre-plant fertilizer recommendations will generally call for the application of blended fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorous and potash in a 1-2-2 ratio (250 to 400 pounds of 10-20-20 is a typical recommendation). Nitrogen at up to 30 pounds per acre banded over the plant row is generally recommended during the period of heavy runner development (late June or early July). An additional, smaller application (up to 20 lbs N) may be suggested for early August.
Heavy fertilizer applications should be avoided in the spring on established beds; too much nitrogen will promote abundant vegetative growth that encourages disease by inhibiting good air circulation needed to dry plant surfaces. The longer moisture films remain on fruit and leaves from irrigation, rain, dew or high humidity, the greater the chance of fungal spores germinating and disease outbreaks occurring. Berries may also become soft as a result of too much nitrogen. Light applications of fertilizer may be made in spring (8-15 lbs of actual N per acre) to promote early plant growth and fruit development.
Leaf tissue analysis is a good way to determine nutrient levels actually in the plant rather than what is in the soil. Sometimes the nutrients in the soil are not available to the plant due to pH, organic matter content, or some other reason. Leaf tissue analysis tells you what the plant is getting and what the plant is lacking. The samples are taken after bed renovation in the summer from the first fully expanded new leaves. At least 50 complete leaves per planting should be taken, rinsed, and allowed to dry completely before processing. Contact your regional fruit specialists for the exact protocol, processing instructions, and fees. Standards are available for comparison to determine if your results indicate the need for corrective measures. See Table 13.
Good root development is essential to the continued productivity and health of the strawberry planting. Primary roots generally live only a year or slightly longer, requiring the development of new roots at successively higher nodes on the growing crowns. To encourage increased root development, strawberry crowns are mulched with about 1 inch of loose soil during the renovation process, enough soil to cover the crown extension that has occurred during the past year without covering the top of the crowns.
Strawberries are a cool weather crop, producing most of their growth in the spring and fall. Growth is greatly slowed during the hot, dry summer months, resulting in a shallow root system. During the growing season (April, May, August, September and October) applying 1-1/2” of water every 12 to 14 days will aid in maximum growth and fruit bud development. During fruiting, adequate moisture (1" to 2” of water per week) will maintain fruit size and production.
Irrigation can also eliminate frost damage to flowers during early bloom periods. If sprinklers are turned on before the temperature at ground level drops to 32˚F and continued until air temperature is above freezing and all ice has melted off the plants, the blossoms will be protected. (Remember, the first blossoms to open will bear the largest berries.) The sensitive, actively growing tissue in the crown will also be protected from freezing injury that would make it more susceptible to pathogen attack.
Day neutral strawberries set fruit continually over several weeks, during the late summer and fall, providing a high value specially item for roadside stands and farm markets. Day neutral plants are often grown as an annual crop, on raised beds with plastic mulch and very high planting densities. As a result, the establishment costs and labor commitment tend to be quite high.
Fertilizer should be applied and worked into the soil prior to planting, or banded into the soil prior to applying plastic mulch and planting. Rates should be determined through soil test but a standard rate of 100 lbs of nitrogen, 50 lbs of phosphorus (P205) and 50 lbs of potassium (K20) is typically incorporated into the soil prior to planting (e.g. 600 lbs/acre of 20-10-10 or its equivalent). Beds should be prepared in the spring or made during the previous fall. Raised beds should be 4” to 12” high with a 1 ½” crown sloping from the center to the edges of the bed to shed water. Bed width depends on how many rows of plants will be established on each bed, from 18” for a single plant row to 46” for 3 to 4 plant rows. In New England, two plant rows per bed are most common and simplest to manage with the bed with of 24” to 42”. Smooth, well packed and shaped beds greatly improve the fit and performance of plastic mulch. Trickle or drip irrigation lines should be installed during bed forming at about a 4” depth in the bed, and a few inches to the side of the planet rows, with either one or two lines, depending on how many plant rows there will be on the bed. Plastic mulch should be laid tightly over the bed immediately after bed forming. Black plastic is commonly used to promote soil warming and to provide weed control.
Dormant, day neutral strawberry crowns should be planted in the spring as soon as the beds are prepared. Planting is done by hand using a simple planting tool. A piece of 1/8” iron flat bar about 12” long is bent at a 90° angle about 4” from one end to create a handle this and is often wrapped with duct tape to provide a soft grip. The opposite end of the bar is notched from the edges to the middle to about a ¾” depth to create shallow inverted “V” at the end. The notched edge is slightly sharpened to ease penetration through the mulch and soil. The notched edge of the tool is placed over a plant that is laid on the plastic so that it will ”grab” about ½” of the root ends as the tool is pushed into the soil, drawing the plant into the bed. Push the crowns straight down through the mulch with the tool and into the soil so that the soil surface comes halfway up the crown. Gently pinch the soil around the crown as you withdraw the planting tool. Plants should be spaced 10” to 14” apart within a row. Planting in a double row, 24” apart, on a 42” wide bed with 13” between plants within the row will require about 13,400 plants per acre.
All flower blossoms that emerge should be pinched off for 4 to 6 weeks after planting. All runner plants that emerge during the summer should also be removed. While runner removal is labor-intensive, it improves both yield and fruit quality. The field should be irrigated immediately after planting and regularly thereafter. One to 2” of water per week is recommended. Drip lines can be used to deliver soluble fertilizers to the plant. Recommended rates of fertilizer vary depending on the number of plants per acre, soil type, and variety. Generally, 2 lbs of actual nitrogen per acre per week applied through the drip lines will provide good growth.
Day neutral strawberry beds are not usually carried over for second year. Although plants can produce an early spring crop the following year, and fruit again the next summer and fall if carried over, fruit quality, especially size, is much lower and runner control becomes a major problem. If the beds are to be carried over, winter protection is required in the form of heavyweight row covers, applied in the fall when the plants are dormant.

Rachel was a child who was underachieving since she had no study skills. She chose Maureen as her mentor and we are so delighted at the connection that they have made. Rachel is now focusing on her work both at school and at home and is getting results well beyond our expectations in a very short space of time. With these results, it has improved her self esteem and she had become very confident in all that she does. Her teachers (at a private school) told us that they had planned to hold her back since her grades were so low but now she is getting 100% on all of her tests.Not only has Maureen come to meet with Rachel at home, she has taken the time to meet Rachel’s teachers and even work with Rachel after school in her classroom. We are so thankful that Maureen has become part of our lives and thank you ClubXcite for sending her to us.

Pretty boy just sits right back and aiming his hungry hole perfectly, he engulfs the entirety of Jared’s junk bareback to the balls. The boy bounces like a newborn in a Jolly Jumper enjoying every thick, hard inch as his schlong slaps Scott’s tight torso. In perfect rhythm, Cook rearranges his legs so Jared can lift him in one swift motion with his gorgeously muscled legs. He plants pretty boy down on the bed and continues to beat that ass up! Jared stops slamming just long enough to give the kid’s hole a thorough inspection with his darting tongue and a few fingers before getting back to some ball slapping, ass banging. Scott folds Dustin’s legs up like a pretzel with his knees by his ears before the ultimate switch-a-roo happens! He gets on the bed and offers his ass to Dustin! The too cute twink has an impressive piece and puts it to good use on Jared’s tight little hole. The cock cam goes in from the bottom to capture all the bareback, hole pounding action up close. The dynamic duo are cumming close to climax in unison. Cook pulls his cock out and aims it at Jared’s hole as instructed by his hungry bottom. He splashes his young seed on Jared’s tightening taint before slamming his schlong back inside to give Scott a creamy filling. Feeling warm inside, Jared can’t hold his load any longer. Dustin puts his pouty lips around the boy’s massive member and gets blasted. Cook keeps slurping cock like a kid with an ice cream cone and then shares come cream with Jared in a sexy final kiss.
Sexy surfer Luke Wilder catches his last wave of the day and emerges from the ocean wet and ripped riding on his big board. His muscled body still looks elegant and graceful as he packs up his gear and changes shorts right there on the beach. The gorgeous setting ignites an orgasmic itch Luke needs to scratch so our beach boy finds a secluded spot to “wax his board.” Making the most of his alone time, Wilder soaks up the surfy setting while seductively tracing his taught, tan body. Feeling zen and horny, his hands find their way towards his other piece of prized wood. The surfboarder spits on his fingers, using natures lube to raise his bone to full mast. Rock hard and getting harder, Luke rides the waves of personal pleasure in public as the sounds of surf crash into the shore. A sex storm of shear pleasure is slowly building in our beautiful boy as he inches his way towards orgasmic ecstasy. Luke’s breath quickens, he looks down at his delicious dick as his surfer boy hair hangs in his chiseled face and he tosses out tremendous tidal waves of white hot surfer spooge. His salty seamen seeps into the sand below while Wilder flops his cock around to enjoy the final waves of pure pleasure.

Next What Can the U.S. Learn from the French Health Care System?Previous What Can the U.S. Learn from Other Countries’ Health Care Systems?
It must be Groundhog Day. Events in Libya have pushed world oil prices over $100 a barrel yet again. Retail gasoline prices, usually low this time of year, are at an all-time seasonal high. Are we in for another round of the same-old, same-old? A replay of Jimmy Carter pledging, “Never Again!” and then doing nothing? Or is there some way we can make this the very last oil price shock?
Producing countries have already figured out how to cope with the curse of oil price volatility. Over the years, producing countries, from Norway to Saudi Arabia to Russia, have established national wealth funds that build up when prices are high and run down when prices fall. Meanwhile, consuming countries have done next to nothing.
The US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, designed to offer short-term protection against physical interruptions of supply, is not intended to serve the purpose of price stabilization, nor would it be capable of doing so. But there is a way. Now would be an ideal time to revive an old idea, a variable oil tax that would reduce price volatility and, at the same time, offset the national security and environmental harms of oil dependency.
A variable, price-smoothing oil tax would work like this. Congress would establish a floor oil price of X dollars per barrel. Whenever the world market price P fell below X, an oil tax T would come into effect to fill the gap: T=X-P. Whenever the price rose above the floor, the tax would be zero. Nothing could be simpler.
Why would it be a good idea? There are two parts to the answer, one making the case for an oil tax in general, and the second explaining why a variable tax would be better than one with a fixed rate.
The main argument for a tax of any kind is that oil consumption has adverse spill-over effects on third parties—effects that are not taken into account when bargaining between producers and consumers sets the price. Economists call those spillover effects externalities. The two most commonly cited externalities of oil consumption are effects on national security and effects on the environment. Imposing a tax on oil would be one way to mitigate them.
Consumption of oil has a negative impact on national security because so much of the world’s oil comes from countries that are corrupt, authoritarian, anti-American, or all of the above. Any increase in US oil consumption pushes up the world price and enriches bad guys in exporting countries. Any reduction in oil consumption undercuts them. An oil tax would insert a wedge between the price paid by US consumers and the price received by foreign producers. To the extent it raised the US price at the pump, it would encourage conservation and investment in alternative energy. To the extent that it lowered the world market price,the tax would take money from the pockets of the bad guys.
An oil tax would be much more effective than the current US oil security strategy, which consists of buying as much as possible from friendly, nearby countries like Canada and Mexico. That strategy does provide some limited protection against a revolution or embargo that might cause a physical interruption of supply, but it does nothing to mitigate negative national security spillovers that operate through prices. The world oil market operates as one big pool. If something sends the price up, as is happening right now, it goes up for everyone. Canada and Mexico are our friends, to be sure, but they are not so friendly as to sell us their oil below its market price. If excess US consumption drives the world oil price higher, it drives it higher for bad-guy producers, too, even those from whom we do not directly buy any oil.
As for environmental externalities of oil consumption, they have been so widely discussed that there is little to add. In recent years, much of the discussion has focused on climate change from oil-related CO2 emissions. But even if you are a climate-change skeptic, don’t forget there are other environmental effects, too. Low oil prices and high consumption mean more local smog and more traffic congestion, regardless of any effects on polar bear habitat. To the extent an oil tax cuts consumption, it improves the environment across several fronts.
Of course, national security and environmental objectives would also be served by a conventional, fixed-rate tax. Why would a variable tax be better?
One reason is that a variable tax would provide an anchor for expectations about oil prices. During episodes of high prices, investments in conservation and alternative energy production become more attractive, but there is also a risk. If oil prices crater again, those investments will not pay off. Knowing that oil prices would not be allowed to drop below a stated floor would make it less risky for consumers to buy energy-efficient cars and entrepreneurs to build plants to produce biodiesel from pond scum. Greater investments in conservation and alternative energy, in turn, would help moderate the next upward movement of oil prices.
Second, a variable oil tax would help mitigate the impact of oil price spikes on the business cycle. James Hamilton has written extensively on that subject. (See here, here, and here.) He points out that most recent oil price spikes, including that of 2008, have been followed by US recessions, and argues that the depth of those recessions has been greater than would be predicted by the effects of higher oil prices acting alone. One reason seems to be that retail gasoline prices have such a high visibility that price spikes disproportionately undermine consumer confidence. Another is that oil price spikes disrupt the automobile market. They not only harm new cars in general, but also shift the mix from large to small cars. Widespread layoffs have followed at US auto companies, which have traditionally specialized in SUVs and light trucks. Finally, says Hamilton, it appears that high oil prices in 2008 exacerbated other factors that were undermining the housing market. As evidence, he cites the fact that the prices of homes in locations that required long commutes fell by more than those with short commutes.
A third advantage of a variable oil tax compared to a fixed one would be political, especially if it were introduced at a time when oil prices were already above the chosen floor. Right now, for example, a tax with a price floor of, say, $85 per barrel would produce no immediate pain at the pump, but the knowledge that prices would never again fall below $85 would encourage long-term investments in conservation and alternative energy. Introducing a variable oil tax at a time when prices were already high could make an actual virtue of the often-lamented tendency of politicians to operate on a much shorter time horizon than business investors.
The idea of a variable, price-smoothing oil tax is not going to appeal to everyone. Let me close with two preemptive comments addressed to the most likely critics.
First, to those for whom all taxes are bad: Fine, for the sake of discussion, let’s stipulate that all taxes are bad. Still, some taxes are worse than others. The worst taxes are those that discourage businesses from investing in the future while encouraging activities with negative spillovers on third parties. The least bad taxes are those that encourage sensible investment and discourage negative spillovers. Given the current state of the budget, even the most fanatical fiscal hawks concede that we need a federal revenue base of 19 or 20 percent of GDP to have any hope at all of averting fiscal catastrophe. So, if we need more than zero tax revenue, wouldn’t it be better to replace really bad taxes, like our loophole-ridden corporate income tax, with less-bad taxes, like a variable oil tax?
Second, to the affordable energy crowd: I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, if there is one thing we can’t afford, it’s affordable energy. “Affordable energy” is really a code-word for holding the price of energy below its true cost to the economy. If we don’t pay for oil at the pump, we pay for it through the back door, in the form of distorted investment decisions, pollution, and reduced national security. Artificially low energy prices make our economy weaker, not stronger. There Ain’t No Such Thing as a Free Lunch. Never was, never will be.

When is it that policy/law makers are going to move to live and work in the world of motion. It’s clear that a price stabilization scheme such as this needs to work around a moving average contained within a band established by the frequency and extents of volatility. No where in a working model can Congress or anyone else “establish [fix] a floor”.

Author Topic: How to get your server into Internet Tab[Fixed With Pics]No Port-Forward Or open (Read 1236 times)
So now i got the method to fix it By the way i got i a year ago but now posting if someone having this problem look at the pics its now for win 7 you have to do same with windows xp
After doing this, the Windows Firewall will allow the server executable to connect with the internet. But if you run the server for the first time, Windows will also ask you if Allow or Disallow connecting this app to the Internet. You don't have to go through Control Panel to do that .
However in most cases, your server will still not be on the "Internet" tab. Terminator that's not a guide how to forward ports :@
No its not port forwarding its the easiest way to show your server in the internet list and if you want port forwarding here is it.
6. Go to http://portforward.com/ and find your router and follow the directions. They should have most of the routers.
If the port is open, then you don’t have a modem problem(meaning you have a cable modem). If it is still closed, then you do not have a cable modem. Please continue to the modem user section
have a wish list for Seventh-day Adventists. As we act on these items, we will be better Christians and a better witness.
1. A just people. When the prophet Micah put the question “What does the Lord require of you?” his immediate response was: “To act justly” (Micah 6:8).*
Concern for justice runs through the Scriptures. The Old Testament, especially in the prophetic writings, comes back to this theme again and again. Doesn’t this seem strange? Shouldn’t God’s people, because of their attachment to Him and religious observances, make admonitions to justice unnecessary?
Not at all. Religious people can be blind to principles of elemental morality. They can talk so much about Jesus that they neglect the Jesus who comes to them as “one of the least” (Matt. 25:40). The “more important matters of the law,” said the Master, are “justice, mercy and faithfulness” (Matt. 23:23).
We Adventists do not always act justly. We show preferential treatment based on the color of a person’s skin; or on their age, gender, occupation, or country of origin. I wish for a church in which justice and fairness govern all our dealings.
2. An open community. The people who meet Jesus, I believe, will be “like the light of morning at sunrise on a cloudless morning, like the brightness after rain that brings the grass from the earth” (2 Sam. 23:4). They will be open and transparent—to God and to one another.
3. A kind people. What would you rather be, right or kind? “Knowledge,” wrote the apostle Paul, “puffs up, but love builds up” (1 Cor. 8:1).
By and large Adventists are upright people. Many people know and admire us for our high standards. But do they also think of us as “the kind church”? When someone is in trouble, do they think of Adventists as the people who will help them out?
Jesus was a kind person. He was “moved with compassion” as He looked out on broken humanity, like sheep without a shepherd (Matt. 9:36, KJV). And He acted to help them.
4. A people of the Book. Yes, a people grounded and fortified by the Word; a people who feed on the Word; and a people who live out the Word.
“The world is too much with us,” lamented the poet Wordsworth many years ago. How true in these days! The world comes to us—we don’t have to go to it. It invades us through our senses; it’s all-pervasive.
Our only defense as followers of Jesus Christ is in daily study of and meditation with the Bible. Think of the difference it would make if each of us changed our habits so that every day we spent more time with the Bible, Ellen White’s writings, and spiritual material than with the world’s messages—its newspapers, magazines, television, and movies.
5. People who live, look, and feel great. That’s the Lord’s wish for us (3 John 2), and we can, by His grace, approach that ideal.
No, I realize that we don’t all start from a level playing field: hereditary and other factors give some of us an advantage. But to a large extent we can be masters of our destiny. We can act on what we know. We can change!
Adventists’ biggest area of need, I believe, is to exercise. You don’t have to embark on a crash course; just get off the couch and out from behind the steering wheel. Do what the Lord created you to do: Walk! You’ll look better and feel better. You’ll be better.
6. A people who put Jesus first, and last, and best in everything. The items above don’t follow a particular order, but this one is special. This is what it’s all about: it’s all about Jesus.
Jesus means grace: He was full of it (John 1:14). Of giving. Forgiving. Second chances. Taking time for people. One-on-one conversations.
Oh, for a church like Him! Impossible? Listen: “All the promises of God in Him are Yes, and in Him Amen” (2 Cor. 1:20, NKJV)!†

Latest import data for key Asian countries and the US are beginning to show the impact of recent output cuts by Opec’s Gulf core. But whilst volumes are down from the record levels hit in the first quarter, they are still high by historical comparison. At least this is the case in volume terms – in terms of market share Gulf Opec is losing out in the fast-growing China market.

Now that summer is upon us (a bit TOO upon us…) it is time to, once again, re-assess our beach attire and achieve poolside perfection. Lying on a beach or lounging by a pool is meant to be synonymous with a natural look, so why is it that poolsides are starting to resemble runways? Nothing rattles my nerves more than seeing someone at a pool in full makeup and 5+ inch wedges. Let’s forget the fuss and plan a beach day-made easy!
Before we can even manage to look decent next to any body of water, a solid health and fitness routine is key. Kick-start your summer with a higher intake of fruits and vegetables and minimize carbs to the healthier kinds (yes, they do exist). It’s always better to consume carbs earlier in the day before you hit the gym or finish work and leave the night time for lighter options. I once heard that one must eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper. It really helps flatten the stomach when you eat lighter at night, provided you haven’t ingested a Big Mac for lunch. Skimping on exercise might fly in the winter time, but now we really can’t afford to do that. Keep your cardio high and never cut out light weights in high repetitions because that’s what will really tone your arms and legs and burn more calories when you are resting. If the gym bores you, just try to switch it up with different classes and activities like swimming. As for the dreaded workplace lunches (“who wants pizza today?!”) there is a three word rule: Just.Say.No. This rule also applies to Frappuccino’s and Baking Tray cookies. My cubicle neighbor is notorious for tempting me with these.
Now that you’re being healthy and good to yourself, make a date with the Avenues. All of your beach necessities will be there _ from the ultimate bronzing lotions (Lancaster) to the perfect sun hat. After taking a trip to the enormous mall with my friend the other day, I noticed that H&M has a really great collection of beachwear this year. River Island also has some colorful ruffled styles that have been popular since last year. Don’t rule out any stores because you might be surprised; some of my favorite swimwear in terms of fit is actually from BCBG. Topshop has some great cover-ups and a place that you might not think of that much anymore, Debenhams, usually carries a nice swimwear collection. I remember going to the Debenhams at Souq Sharq last summer and finding some great one-pieces and sarongs there.
Every beach bunny needs a huge beach bag to throw her iPods, sunglasses, and lotions into. I saw some really funky ones at Aishti with bright colors and adorable illustrations. Canvas bags are also great because they will match all of your beachwear and stay clean! Protect your feet from the scorching sand with fab flip-flops. I love my Havanas the most, and Accessorize also has many different styles and colors to choose from.
Now that your clothing is set, don’t forget to take care in the sunshine. ALWAYS use SPF on your face and body (especially your face) to avoid looking like a leather bag later on in life. You should actually wear SPF every day because we basically live in an oven. Don’t think you won’t get a tan _ you will get a tan, the only things you won’t get are wrinkles! Keep your mane healthy by pampering your strands with almond or coconut oil to get a great conditioning treatment while you bake. Happy tanning!

A ‘pop-up’, in this context, is a temporary retail space which offers companies a ‘here-today-gone-tomorrow’ sales or marketing environment to showcase a brand or product in a ‘trial size’ platform. Being such a short term venture, a pop-up offers up relatively low-cost opportunities for a company to take some creative risks, have a bit of fun, generate some buzz and introduce their brand to new audiences.
It’s a kind of low-commitment advertising platform which allows emerging brands to experiment a bit with their retail options and, at the same time, create an immersive experience for potential customers without signing up for a ton of overheads involved with a permanent retail location.
To take advantage of the ever evolving shift in shopping behaviours of the general public, brands are increasingly embracing the brave new world of high-tech, high-concept experiential pop-up shops. The retail transformation we’re seeing where consumers are moving from in-store to on-line and prefer experience and interaction with a brand is not just a passing fad, but a by-product of brands evolving to meet market demands.
Just like social media campaigns, experiential marketing efforts in the physical world represent quantifiable results for brands by creating memorable, shared experiences. This shared and unique relationship builds a devoted clientele which, in turn drives sales and retains brand loyalty.
Brands are using pop-up platforms to, not only sell their products direct, but also to heighten consumer experiences. It is imperative to engage the consumer through stimulating aesthetics and interactive displays. These micro locations are being employed not just to extend brand awareness but to target prospective customers in a more authentic and experiential way.
Similar to exhibition stands, the environment created can be completely controlled and themed by the exhibitor. For example, the ‘Kube’, specifically designed by us here at Exhibitionco for outdoor branding events and activations, is is a highly adaptable and durable mobile unit which allows for an almost unlimited level of customisation suiting various individual requirements, whilst bundling up into a compact package for easy installation and transportation.
There are so many options available from tailor made mobile units such as the Kube, to shipping containers or individual custom designed displays. You are really only limited by imagination and creativity, or at least the imagination of your exhibit designer.

The L’Oréal Singapore for Women in Science National Fellowships programme is aimed at recognizing ambitious and talented women in science and encouraging young women to confidently pursue research. This event is organized annually with support from Singapore National Commission for UNESCO and A*STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research). The fellowship awards two different grants of SGD 30,000 each, one in the field of Life Sciences and the other in the field of Physical and Engineering Sciences.
The 2016 physical and engineering science fellowship was awarded to Shao Huilin, 32, who is currently an Assistant Professor at the Department of Biomedical Engineering & Principal Investigator at the Biomedical Institute for Global Health Research & Technology (BIGHEART), National University of Singapore. She also holds the position of Joint Investigator, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Agency for Science, Technology and Research.
Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles actively secreted by cancer cells into the circulation. They represent a rich repertoire of molecular information. Integrating expertise in device engineering, materials science and molecular biology, Assistant Professor Shao’s research aims to overcome these technological challenges by developing new generations of nanotechnology-based biosensor platforms for sensitive, fast and cost-effective diagnostics and in order to learn whether patient respond to treatment. In the long-run the ultimate aim is to be able to cure diseases such as cancer and neuro-degenerative diseases.
When asked about her motivation to work in this subject area, she said, “The first talk about biomembranes during my bachelor’s degree in Cornell University struck me very hard, which inspired me to read more about biophysics and solve real life problems”. While the topic of women in science was approached, she mentioned that “The women population in the role of physical scientists is very low and I hope that this fellowship encourages more girls to pursue this field”.

Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles that are present in many and perhaps all biological fluids, including blood, urine, and cultured medium of cell cultures. Exosomes contain various molecular constituents of their cell of origin, including proteins and RNA. It is becoming increasingly clear that exosomes have specialized functions and play a key role in, for example, coagulation, intercellular signaling, and waste management. - from wikipedia

The aims of this study were to form a new algorithm under the guidance of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA) to localize the accessory pathway (AP) in patients w ith the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome using the surface ECG during sinus rhythm, and to test other algorithms, which have been proposed for the same purpose. Sixty-five patients with WPW syndrome, who had only one atrioventricular AP and mani fest or intermittent preexcitation on the surface ECG were included in the study. The exclusion criteria were inadequate preexcitation (QRS duration $ 100 ın s ) and an ultirnately unsuccessful RFA procedure. The AP was Iocalized to one of the eight predetermined anatoın ical zones around the mitral and tricuspid annuli. The ECGs were analyzed for QRS complex polarity, delta wave polarity and QRS complex amplitude. Cri teria that could distinguish different AP zones were identified. The criteria with highest success were used to form the algorithm. The new algorithm correctly localized the AP in 92% of the patients to one of the seven AP zones. A differentiation between right and left posteroseptal pathways could not be achieved. Three different algorithms proposed by other investigators were tested prospectively with the same ECGs. Although the reported success rates for correct localization of the AP were 87%, 92% and 93%, these algorithms showed lower success rates in our study group (72%, 74% and 62%, respectively). W e concluded that our new ECG algorithm is a useful noninvasive tool to guide the RFA procedure; but a prospective study is needed to verify its high success rate. A drop in the accuracy of our algorithm should be expected in a different group of patients, as we have observed for the other algorithms.

These rides are not mine. I am only sharing the data. The Damion Alexander Team cannot guarantee anybody’s safety. There are unknown and unforeseen potential hazards in every ride so you should pay attention and take reasonable precautions. I always use a helmet. I think that Helmets are required when riding. If you choose to listen to music during rides you should only use the headset in the right ear and keep the headset out of the left ear. Better yet, buy a FarEnd Gear earbud. Communication is essential during all rides and having the ability to hear is a part of your responsibility to others. Please also ride within your limitations. You are not racing the Tour de France. If you see someone that is not riding within their limitations or are becoming a hazard to others we should politely bring this to their your attention Dothis for your and everybody’s safety.
Also, it is everybody’s responsibility to follow all traffic laws. We are not lemmings. Just because somebody does something foolish does not mean you need to follow. Use your head and enjoy your ride.
WHERE DO ALL THE RIDES COME FROM? These links and shops and clubs and teams and facebook and YOU. See a ride that is missing. Please let me know Damion@DamionAlexadner.com. Thanks
This list is a major time commitment and it is my pleasure to put it together. All I ask in return for the list is that you remember I’m A REALTOR. If you have a relationship with another REALTOR, I love loyalty and respect those relationships. However, if not, or if you need a second opinion, Please keep me in mind. Many agents spend money advertising for new business, others sit open houses or cold call. My business is based on referrals from past clients and friends. The less time I have to do traditional prospecting the more I can do for the cycling community. For example: this list.

This weekend is the Tour De Mesa. I hope everyone who is up there has a great ride and keeps the rubber side down. Sunday Cyclovia will be the perfect recovery ride. Unfortunately, I can’t make it to Mesa, but will be out shooting photos at Cyclovia.
It’s that time of the year. Most of the morning rides start earlier. It seems like each week one of them is changing, so check to make sure the time before you head out.
Arizona Cyclist is closing their Campbell location in two weeks. Steve said to come on down and check out some great deals. He would rather sell it than move it.
Perhaps you have dreamed of owning your own bike shop. ProBikes, now Lemmon Bikes, on Tanque Verde would love an offer on everything. 35K and you can have everything from the espresso machine to all the tools, displays and inventory. Ask for Jerry.
Last year I was appointed to the Pima County Parks and Rec Commission. I’ve spent the first 6 months trying to figure out what is the purpose of this advisory position and to see how it can be used to advance my agenda( It’s Bikes and getting people outdoors if you were unaware). This past week I was able to use the position to set up meetings with county Supervisor Christy and Administrator Huckleberry for a group looking at bringing 300-400 cyclist to Tucson next year. Pima county clearly understands the value cycling brings to the community and they are very interested in bringing people to the Old Pueblo to ride. If you have any concerns or ideas about our parks, let me know. I’m listening.

Have I mentioned I like Bikes? Not just to ride, but as public art installations as well. One of my favorite Tucson Artists, Joe Pagac, has a vision for a whimsical bike mural on the corner of Speedway and Stone on Epic Rides Galactic Headquarters. It represents so much that is great about the Tucson art and cycling community and will be a constant reminder of how important cycling is in the region. Like so many great projects, it does require funding so Joe Started a Kickstarter campaign and has already raised $15,500 of the $18,000 he needs. With Kickstarter, if he does not reach the goal, the project does not happen and there are only a few days left in the campaign. If you are so inclined, please kick in a few bucks. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1092548129/huge-cycling-bike-mural-for-tucson-arizona

This is the most important ride list of the year. Why? Because more people in Tucson train for El Tour De Tucson and after ride day, put the bike down for months and even years. With the holidays, parties, family, and all the stress that we shoulder this time of the year, it’s easy to hang up the bike.
So I’m challenging you to commit now to making cycling a year long commitment. If you are the type of person who needs to have an event to trail for, the list has races, multiple day tours and charitable rides. Perhaps start commuting to work once a week.
There is no joy that I have experienced in all I do for the cycling community than when someone comes up and says that I motivated them to get on the bike and they have lost weight, or are in control of their diabetes, and even that their intimate relationships are on the rise.

Lets get this party started. The early start. There are nearly 2000 images to get through from the circuit race. Today I need to prospect for new business for my real estate team. However, I’d rather save the time and focus on the photos, for you. So, send me a referral today and I can justify rocking through all the images. Otherwise, I’m going to need to focus on my real job and leave the hobby for next week.
These photos are a major time commitment and it is my pleasure to take the photos and share them with you. All I ask in return for the photos is that you remember I’m A REALTOR. If you have a relationship with another REALTOR, I love loyalty and respect those relationships. However, if not, or if you need a second opinion, Please keep me in mind.

Singer Jordin Sparks arrives at the American Idol Grand Finale in Hollywood, California, April 7, 2016.
A number of celebrities take time out of their day to share a Bible verse with fans on social media, singer Jordin Sparks chose to share nine.
The 26-year-old singer-songwriter shared nine verses from Proverbs 27 on Twitter with more than 4 million fans on Saturday. Sparks began with separating Proverbs 27:1–6 into six consecutive tweets, before moving on to Proverbs 27:17, “As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend.”
She added her own message to the tweet, “shout out to my sharpeners! You know who you are! I love you,” before tweeting verses 19 and 21.
Sparks has been vocal about her faith in the past, inviting her fans to join her when she previously led worship at Angelus Temple in Los Angeles, California, earlier this year.
The singer has also spoken about the impact her faith and the Church has had on her career as an entertainer.
“My faith has been a humongous part of how I have looked at my career. I started out singing in church very young and it took off from there,” Sparks said in an interview with Cross Rhythms. “The music business is a very secular world and there are always people quick to point to you as a hypocrite when you mess up with something and fall. I know that God has blessed me to be where I am and everything he has placed before me is just so amazing.”

The club is pleased to announce the appointment of Brett Whitehead as Head Coach at the club. Brett joins the club at a time when we are looking to rebuild the Open Age side following the departure of a number of players from last years squad
Brett has a solid background in rugby league having started his playing days at Blackpool Scorpions in the youth teams, before playing for Wigan St Patricks at under 18 level and progressing to a number of professional clubs most recently Hunslet and Hemel.
Chairman, Simon Hornby, commented ” it has been a long process finding and appointing a new coach, but we feel that Brett represents a positive appointment that will ultimately be worth the wait. He has been involved in and understands the local rugby league scene and the importance of developing local rugby league talent. In the past we have looked to supplement numbers with players from rugby union, ultimately this can only be a tactical solution and our strategic aim needs to be to develop a long term supply of local rugby league players”.
Bretts initial objective will be to grow playing numbers and grow the fixture list such that next year we have a strong case for entering the North West Mens league division 5.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Catcher in the Rye, and Great Expectations have all been crowned as classic bildungsroman novels. They each include the theme of a young individual who goes out into the world, discovers hardship, and ultimately matures through the circumstances he or she has experienced. But what about Jane Austen’s Emma? Austen has an inverted, satirical style of writing, meaning that she warps or misrepresents the general characteristics for some of the genres in which she writes, and thus humorously critiques the world around her. For example, the bildungsroman genre usually has the developing individual leave the initial setting of the story and travel to find a sense of individualism. The individual associated with development in Emma, however, stays within a familiar setting for the duration of the story, thus tweaking the idea of a physical journey associated with one’s developmental journey. Austen’s novel rebels against the typical bildungsroman stereotype of a tragic individual’s taxing journey to find identity.
Austen writes about the stage of life between youth and adulthood of Emma, an upper class young lady of twenty-one growing up in Highbury, England. Since the main character in a typical bildungsroman novel is the character to go through the maturation, one might assume that Emma is the bildungsroman figure. However, Austen plays her audience by making a secondary character, Harriet Smith, the individual on whom she focuses the theme of personal development.
As mentioned, a bildungsroman usually has some unfortunate event or catastrophe, such as a death, abuse, or rejection, which causes an individual to mature (Hader). The trials Austen puts Harriet Smith through do not cause physical harm to anyone, but do somewhat bruise Harriet emotionally. She is denied love twice by the gentlemen Emma has compelled her to like, and she denies love to a man in whom she finds great joy. As the reader can see, Harriet is kept in her unhappy state due to her dependence on Emma’s guidance.
Mr. Elton is the first man to reject Harriet. She is heartbroken when she finds that not only is Mr. Elton disinterested in her, but that he is deeply infatuated with her dear friend and advisor, Emma. As the reader knows, Emma has encouraged Harriet’s affection towards Mr. Elton, which has resulted in a major blunder. Harriet learns from her mistakes and matures by not listening so closely to the advice given by her slightly misguided friend, Emma. Learning from mistakes would fit a typical bildungsroman; however, since this is a novel by Austen, readers can expect some elements to stray from the norm. Austen writes, “Harriet bore the intelligence very well – blaming nobody – and in everything testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend” (Austen 129). In essence, Harriet does not learn from her mistake and instead continues to look towards the knowledge and counsel of Emma, which delays her independence a little longer.
Emma also encourages Harriet’s post-Elton love interest, but only until she realizes that it is Mr, Knightly. This precipitates Emma’s discovery of her own infatuation with Mr. Knightley. Emma sends Harriet away after informing her of Mr. Knightley’s true attachment. Surely this time Harriet realizes Emma’s faults and has matured to the point where she is no longer dependent on Emma’s advice. Yet again, Austen twists the stereotypical bildungsroman when she writes, “Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first: but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the fullest exultation in the present and future” (Austen, 439). As the text shows, Harriet still relies on the approval of Emma in the area of love. Furthermore, Austen has Harriet dismiss any wrongdoings on Emma’s part when Harriet blames herself for being “presumptuous and silly.” It is only by separating from Emma due to their mutual interest in Mr. Knightly that Harriet is able shed Emma’s influence and return to the clear sense of purpose with which she entered the story.
In the end, Harriet rekindles her love of Mr. Martin, a match Emma discouraged early in the novel. Austen has thus caused Harriet’s circumstantial life to come full circle. As Austen explains in the passage, “The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible” (Austen, 439), Harriet has matured since her first proposal, which is revealed in the fact that she realizes her desire for Robert Martin supersedes the attractions Emma imposed, and Harriet independently decides to marry him. Thus, the pattern of heartache is broken, and Harriet is able to change the direction of her life, thanks in part to her new found maturity and self-dependence.
One final correlation Austen makes with the bildungsroman novel is the identity Harriet finds at the end of the book. Whereas the usual bildungsroman has the protagonist find independence and identity through the circumstances throughout the novel, Austen plays with the meaning of “identity” by having Harriet discover her biological identity, which had been unknown until the closing chapter. The bildungsroman definition of identity might be the personal sense of worth or value, regardless of the circumstances, in which one finds one’s self, Harriet’s social identity is dependent on the status of her lost father, and this is most definitely related to the circumstances in which she finds herself. Thus, Austen has yet again subverted a bildungsroman trait.
With all this information, one might ask how Austen’s novel could be considered a bildungsroman at all. Yet the elements of a bildungsroman are present in Emma. Harriet is a young lady. She is exposed to the harshness of the world. She matures by gaining independence in her decision-making process. She finds her identity. Considering that bildungsroman novels debuted in the late eighteenth century, Austen does a remarkable job of not only writing a bildungsroman novel but also twisting elements to play with the reader’s mind. Even though Jane Austen may not have intended to parody a coming of-age novel, Emma has turned out to be a brilliant twist in the bildungsroman genre.

A throwaway comment at The Standard had me thinking the heat had gone off John Banks because the spin that the law was in some way unclear was working. Read the Act people. What don't these people understand about the meaning of anonymous? Here's the transcript of John Key talking to Leighton Smith, Newstalk ZB May 15: "People can criticise the way it might have all worked out in terms of the donations and I don’t need to know all the ins and outs and I don’t because all I need is a clear assurance he hasn’t broken the law. "But I will say this. The Local Electoral Act, which is the act that covered taking of donations for the mayoral campaign, is a very liberal and loose act. So the previous Labour Government changed the act when it came to central government, chose not to do it for local government. "Under the old local government rules you can go and talk to a donor, I can say ‘Leighton I would love you to give to me.' You can say to the donor ‘look you may not want to be identified so you can give anonymously.’ You can tell them how to do it. And in the end unless you don’t absolutely know that they’ve given, you’ve complied with the law. "Now that might seem like a crazy law, but that’s the way the law was constructed. And you can’t hang someone for complying with the law.' The Labour-led Government and local government minister Sandra Lee did change the Act. There is nothing in it about schooling people on how to donate anonymously. In fact, the sections relating to anonymity seem to be so the candidate doesn’t have to account for every dollar dropped into a bucket at a rally, rather than allowing the old game of “hide the donor” to continue. There’s a clear definition of donations, including a formula for working out the value of goods or services donated at a discount, and a discussion on aggregation – so the idea of splitting donations to anonymise them is on another planet. There is a limit as to how much can be spent, depending on the population size of the area being contested, which didn’t exist in local government before 2001. The candidate, not their agent or campaign, is required to sign the schedule of donations and expenses. They must list “the name and address of each person who made an electoral donation to the candidate and the amount of each electoral donation.” If an electoral donation of money or of the equivalent of money is made to the candidate anonymously and the amount of that donation exceeds $1000, they must list (i) the amount of that donation; and (ii) the fact that it has been received anonymously. Anonymous “means a donation that is made in such a way that the candidate concerned does not know who made the donation.” If “know” means the same as former justice ministers Doug Graham and Bill Jefferies were supposed to “know” what their finance company was up to, the question of Banks’ knowingness has to hinge on “made in such a way”. By that standard he had to “know” the origin of all cheques made into campaign accounts under his control, because it says so on the cheque or the deposit slip. Even if it was routed through a trust, that has to be disclosed. It would seem the only way large donations could come in anonymously is cash in plain envelopes, delivered by strangers in darkened rooms.

In an effort to find answers to some of those questions, researchers recently identified the so-called “wanderlust gene” (DRD4-7R, to be exact), which is present in about 20 percent of humans. This gene is said to cause a strong desire, if not impulse, to wander, travel and explore the world.
As a working journalist and travel columnist, I was recently tested for this gene by Curio Hotels. After vigorously swabbing the inside of my cheeks, I seal-locked my specimen in a plastic bag, overnighted the sample to a lab on the East Coast and awaited the results.
Surely I possess the gene, I thought to myself after mailing the package. I’ve traveled since I was a boy. I’ve traveled even more as an adult with a disposable income and a knack for buying experiences over things. And I’ve done so largely for curiosity’s sake.
But my attempt for scientific validation was not meant to be. Last month, I received the following rejection notice via email:
“We are writing to notify you of your results from the genetic saliva swab kit,” the letter began. “Based on a test with 99% accuracy, our results show that you do not carry the DRD4-7R gene. Testing aside, it is completely possible to not be a carrier of the gene and still love to travel and/or exhibit strong curiosity.”
Okay, then. Why do I like to travel? I asked myself. And if negative testers can still “move freely about the cabin” called planet Earth, of what use is the wanderlust gene anyway?
Turns out, genes are just one part of a three-ingredient miracle. “In the end, what such labels mean is that your genetics have many subtle influences on your behavior,” explains Ayon Nandi, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University. “The interaction of genes, environment and nurture come together in complex ways to produce the variety of human behavior.”
There’s your real answer. In addition to the “subtle influences” of our genes on our behavior, our environment (or surrounding cultural norms and conditions) as well as our nurturing (i.e. upbringing, whom we choose to surround ourselves with and what we think about) is what really makes us who we are.
Since I surround myself with adventurous people and feed my brain with a lot of curious questions, it only makes sense that I like to travel often, even though I don’t possess the sexy-sounding “wanderlust gene.”
Truth is, that’s even better news than if my test came back positive. In other words, our genes do not define us. They certainly play a role. But we are so much more than a predestined blob of DNA, genes and chromosomes.
As human beings, we are mostly what we eat, think and do. If we put good in, we get good out. Or in this case, if we put travel in, we get travel out. Wanderlust gene be damned.

I`ve noticed in many forums that the same links are posted and forgotten about, and then a few months later are requested again and then reposted. So I will leave this up at the top and as time goes by we can add to the list. Some common requests are:
Do you collect sauces? I have been for 25 years. I don't know how many I have but it would be more than 500 bottles. I use lots as well but have managed not to open these. I use "Arizona Gunslinger" more than any other type. Not very hot but really good flavour. I order about six cases a year.
This link was given to us by soEzzy on another topic, I thought it was such a great link I would add it here.

“You humans have been very naughty. Ignoring your own long-term well-being for instant gratification. That is so Mars and Jupiter! Now you’re set on self-destruct, and it’s time for me to assert myself, so that you begin to take your long-term prospects into account when making decisions. Just to ensure that I get your attention, I’ve made an arrangement with Uranus. You can bet we’ll be sure to disrupt your lives until you shift your old, bad habits. And just in case you were in doubt as to my sincerity, you can expect to hear from me many times in the coming years. In celebration of my stay in Virgo, the first problems you must address are health care and the health of Planet Earth.”
So says Saturn, just in time for the peak in his yearly cycle, which occurred on March 8. Here are his talking points:
• Get real on health care. The current “fend for yourself” health care offered in the US right now is a massive drain on the economy and couldn’t be more inefficient. The health insurance industry has brought us all to our knees. Health insurance premiums have gone up 20% in the past year, and the insurance companies are digging in, refusing to recognize, or care about, the massive inequities in how healthcare is doled out in this country. (Reported by Ed Schultz, 3/10/09)
• Don’t use the economic downturn as a reason to put off health care reform. It is a primary reason for the downturn, and as people lose their jobs, the numbers of uninsured will skyrocket. This is a disaster waiting to happen. It will place a crushing economic burden on state and local governments to fill in the gap. The current health care system is a disincentive for travelers. Many who could travel to the US and pump valuable dollars into the American economy will not because they fear for their financial well-being if they should experience illness or injury while in the States. Many American citizens find it cheaper and just as supportive of their health to go to foreign countries for health care. The time for health care reform is now.
• It’s also time to take responsibility for your own health. Those who leave their health in the hands of another person and completely abdicate their responsibilities will suffer more and experience poorer health. This means eating well, exercising, and knowing as much as you can about what makes your body work the way it does. Passively letting your doctor tell you what to do on the basis of tests will no longer cut it. You need to stand up for yourself, become informed, and make your own health care decisions with you as the lead member and most active proponent of your health care team. According to the Gallup-Healthways Project, Americans are eating fewer healthy foods, exercising less, and increasing unhealthy behaviors like smoking and drinking since the economic downturn began last year. Now, anyone can tell you that fruits and vegetables are cheaper than cigarettes and alcohol, and a walk around the block is free. If you recognize yourself making unhealthy choices, it’s time to get back on the bandwagon.
• Get off the gas-guzzlers. Sure, maybe you can’t do it now, but if you have two cars, drive the one that is more fuel-efficient when only one car is needed. Walk or bike when possible (this gives you a two-fer, since you’re getting exercise too). But don’t think for a minute that your responsibility ends here. The biggest polluters are in business and industry. Seek out the polluters and help them see the errors of their ways.
Saturn has indicated that he will issue more memos in the future. He will be watching and sending signals to each of us. Don’t forget that his current companion, Uranus, has the ability to shock us into new awareness if we are lagging behind the curve.
C’mon! You know this is good for you! Remember Saturn’s mantra, “Think long term, think long term.” You’ll get rewards that stick with you, provide the foundation for your next enterprise. How bad is it if you have great health? What’s not to like?

Lackberg is getting the big push in the wake of hugely popular fellow Swedes like Henning Mankell and Steig Larsson, and apparently she’s wildly popular in her native Sweden. Like Mankell, her work owes a debt to some of the great British writers of contemporary crime fiction – Ruth Rendell and P.D. James spring to mind – but she doesn’t quite have their tight pacing skills. While I enjoyed this novel very much I was conscious as I read it that I was reading it in translation, and I was often wanting her to hurry things up a bit, though I wouldn’t really call her story telling style languid. She’s capable of some stunning bits of psychological insight, however, thus the comparison to James and Rendell.
The story itself has a terrific premise. Erica Falck, returned to her childhood home of Fjallbacka to clean out her parent’s home after their deaths, happens to be the person who finds the dead body of her childhood friend, Alex. Coincidental, yes, but Lackberg manages to make Erica’s encounter with Alex’s body seem completely believable. Alex’s frosted body in the tub, wrists slit, is a haunting and creepy image that carries through the entire novel. It’s never far from your reader’s mind, and to keep it fresh, the author intersperses vignettes told from the killer’s? – Alex’s lover’s? – point of view that describe the dead body (and the living one) in some detail. And of course while it appears at first glance that Alex’s death is a suicide, what mystery novel actually centers on a death by suicide? Alex’s death is of course a murder.
Erica is a writer, specializing in biographies of women writers, and she’s working on one as she cleans out her parent’s house. However, Alex’s story so captivates her that she begins to write about it, thus drawing herself into the investigation, as does her budding relationship with the policeman in charge of the case. Her history with Alex is also problematic and shades the story – they had been girlhood friends, then drifted apart for no reason Erica could ever fathom. As Erica works away at this puzzle, she gets closer and closer to the heart of the mystery.
Sidebars include a look at Erica’s sister’s troubled marriage; her relationship with the policeman; the new boss at the police station, who nobody likes; and the odd and unexplainable relationship Alex apparently had in secret with a local painter who was better known as a town drunk. Lackberg’s explication of all these various ties and relationships is sensitive and detailed, but I wished sometimes that we weren’t along for the cup of coffee or piece of pastry as she goes about her business. It slows down the action. On the other hand, a nice passage like this one makes it all worthwhile:
All the emotion in the room made the air feel supersaturated, but at the same time it felt as if they were doing some spring cleaning of the soul. There was so much that had gone unspoken, so much dust in the corners, and they both could feel that it was time to take out the dust mop.
“Spring cleaning of the soul” is such a lovely phrase and idea that I was willing to put up with some of the side trips Lackberg takes in telling her story, which ends up being a compelling and well thought out one. I’d be willing to revisit Erica and Fjallbacka.

Lupine Shifter Dimitri has always had to defend himself to other Shifters. As a red wolf, he’s not considered a “pure” wolf, and the battles have honed him into a tough fighter, a champion of the fight clubs. Jaycee Bordeaux, a leopard Shifter, is Dimitri’s staunchest defender and oldest friend. Dimitri is determined to turn that friendship into a mate bond.
Jaycee loves that idea, but she knows that a mate bond can’t be forced. And when Dimitri and Jaycee are called on to go undercover to protect collared Shifters, she knows the dangers ahead will make or break their future together.
Red Wolf is a story that I have been eagerly anticipating since reading White Tiger. Red Wolf is the tenth installment of a fantastic and intriguing shifter series. It has been quite interesting to see how Jennifer Ashley has developed this series over the years. In Red Wolf, we have a friends to lovers trope. Our hero Dimitri and our heroine Jaycee, are more alike than they realize. They both ended up as orphans, and not fitting with the norm even for shifters. Dimitri is a red wolf which is very rare, and also suffers from a stutter. Jaycee is a feline shifter, is the most loyal of Dimitri’s defenders. Dimitri at the beginning of this story, has issued a mate claim on Jaycee. And right in the middle of their little tango of mating dance here, they are sent to go on important but very dangerous mission. Their mission is to go undercover, and help protect the uncollared shifters. As Dimitri and Jaycee go on this mission together, they are also faced with secrets of the past, dangerous dealing of the fae, and a dangerous enemy that is cunning and one that they won’t see coming.
Red Wolf is quite the story we have here. I have always enjoyed Dimitri and Jaycee especially from seeing them from White Tiger. Dimitri and Jaycee actually makes a fabulous couple. They are both two of the best trackers, they both have dominant personalities which delivers some unique dynamics in their relationship. Now I will say that the hero in this story was quite different from the others that we have seen. One, that I really enjoyed seeing was seeing him struggle with his stutter, and having Jaycee finish his sentences. Quite frankly, it was just darling seeing how well they were connected with each other. Dimitri has never really been accepted by shifter society. It broke my heart at times, seeing how they viewed him, always judging him for being different. And we do some great inner strengths that come from his character. Jaycee is quite the independent heroine. She cares deeply for Dimitri, but she also doesn’t want to lose who she is if she accepts the mating with Dimitri. When it comes down to the important decision, she starts to realize she has always wanted what Dimitri has seeked from her too.
I’m not a little cub, you have to placate. I’m not the Lupine just past his transition who wanted sex with you before his craving for you killed him. I mate claimed you, Jaycee, my best friend. Not because I thought it would make you obedient–hell, I’m not that deluded. I did it because I fucking wanted to. I claimed you because of your sassy mouth. Because your hair shines like gold in the sunshine, because as a leopard, you can hang upside down from a tress, for the Goddes’ sake. Because your eyes look like topaz, because you can kick the ass of any Shifter who gets in your way. Because you jumped into the fight club ring to keep me from being trounced by a Lupine who tried to tranq me. Because you’re hot, you drive me fucking crazy, and I don’t want any other asshole Shifter.
Jayce has a very proud and stubborn nature at times, which tends to get her into trouble and she is so impatient at times. It was pretty entertaining, but then she is a feline, and they aren’t always the most patient of creatures. We also get some fabulous fun times with our old or new favorites such as 1. Ben, who I seriously—-like REALLY he needs his own book and NOW because with each installment I just fall more in love with his character and want him to find his own HEA 2. Tiger—can I ever get enough of this lovely man? He is the most unique out of all the characters Ashley has written, and he always brings a smile to my face. 3. Kendrick and Addy and their charming cubs. My goodness I just fell in love with this couple again. They had me laughing so hard in this one. 4. Dylan, because he is always interfering and rude at times, but so SMART and what a fighter.
The story line is a pretty thrilling and exciting adventure, and takes us places that we don’t expect us to go. From a mysterious haunted house that protects those it cares about, to a strange shifter clan that have unique characters and the mysterious and dangerous lands of the fae. Red Wolf is a story that definitely led through some dark and dangerous roads, and it just led me on a great intriguing mystery. The romance that builds between Dimitri and Jaycee balances so well with the plot twists. What I have always admired about Jennifer Ashley’s books, is the well balanced stories she delivers, and Red Wolf is no different. Dimitri and Jaycee are a fantastic couple, they kick ass booty together, and have powerful chemistry. The way that they fight together, and also how they tend to fight FOR each other is brilliantly written.
Red Wolf is a well written shifter romance that brings together elements of never ending plot twists, a engaging dynamic romance, sizzling chemistry, and enough action and intrigue to pull you to the edge of your seats. A WILD RIDE!!

FERRISBURGH — The owner of Vergennes modular and mobile home dealership Town & Country Homes Inc. has a town permit and is seeking an Act 250 permit amendment that would allow him to move his sales and display office to Route 7 in Ferrisburgh, just north of Vergennes.
The 17-acre site on the highway’s east side that Town & Country owner Patrick Whitley is eyeing formerly housed a driving range and miniature golf course that was operated by late Ferrisburgh resident Bob McNary.

Web Development can become a tricky thing to budget for when you don’t really know what your options are or how much those options should cost. This really great tool which is 100% FREE will ask you a couple of questions and give you some really valuable insight into how much you can expect to pay for various services.
Is there a module or a feature you’ve been dying to get off the ground, but just haven’t been able to get the funding to build it? Then DrupalFund.us is just the thing for you.
I’ve been using Drupal for about 6 years and to date I’ve never found a place where once can easily submit a project and get funding for that project. I submitted my first project to DrupalFund 7 days ago and today it went into the funding stage. The module I propose is something I know people would definitely use, but how if people are willing to throw money at it… that’s the million dollar question.

Until quite recently, this blog post would have consisted of me explaining how you use Firebug to inspect each request to see if any URLs are being called without “https”. Luckily that’s no longer necessary, thanks to this very cool tool:
As you probably already know, Laravel has a lot of flexibility around “routes” and even more so if you combine it with “filters“. The easiest way to deal with SSL in Laravel is using filters. As apposed to struggling with .htaccess or doing it some other way in code. I created the following two filters and this solved the problem for me:
I’m sure the “QUERY_STRING” part could probably be replaced with a more Laravel-y way of doing this, but this worked for me.
If you ever needed a reason to do more thorough code reviews, here’s a good one. I made the mistake of leaving the following link in the code of one of my projects:
Yes, spare me the lecture. I know this is bad and could easily have been avoided. Nevertheless, I am writing about this, because what was annoying about this was how I managed to find that it was causing issues: a friend of mine actually told me they can’t access the site because Avast is blocking them. Long story short, Avast sees this kind of code as a malware attack. Rightly so too, because a malicious website could do malicious things using a tactic like this.
My problem, however, came in after fixing the link. Even after restarting my machine, and telling Avast that the URLs are safe, it still decided to block the site. First prize would’ve been for it to just forget that it came across the site and rescan it as a new potential threat. This way I would be able to tell if something was still wrong. Unfortunately, Avast doesn’t work like that. In order to fix the problem, you get to do this:
This solved the problem for me, and me only. I still need to figure out how much of a problem this is for other users. There are bound to be other Avast users that are still blocked from accessing the site. I started by reporting the issue as a false positive here.
Its a day later and I never heard back from Avast but it seems Avast is no longer blocking my site. So either they saw my complaint, or it expires after a certain amount of time.

When you lose your sight, it can make you feel incredibly lonely. The feeling of isolation, the snatch of your independence and the knock of your confidence with everyday life is a massive impact. The overwhelming feeling of grief is awful. You yearn for what you have lost, unknown whether it will return or not. At least that’s how we felt. I’m Laura. My first noticeable decline was February 2016 – the cause of which is still unknown. As time went on, I eventually lost my career as a lab…
A little bit about me: I am an 18-year-old high-school senior from St. Paul, Minnesota. I have Stargardt Disease and I’m significantly visually impaired. A couple of years ago I started a non-profit called Louie’s Vision that works to help kids with visual impairments find adventure. About a year ago, I approached my parents and told them I wanted to do the Ironman, a one-day race that consists of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride, and a full 26.2-mile marathon. I was just 17 years old, had no experience…
My name is Dan Mancina, I am from Michigan outside of Detroit. I was born with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a disease that has deteriorated my vision throughout my life. I have lost about 95 percent of my vision so far. I have been skating since I was about seven years old and am now 31. When I had lost the majority of my functional vision about six years ago, I stopped skating all together, and would not even leave my house without a human guide. I felt very lost and…
Ever since the era of the Founding Fathers, Washington, D.C. has been the de facto epicenter of political and social causes, playing host to millions of people from all walks of life gathering and marching across the striking backdrop of the National Mall. And earlier this year, another huge crowd gathered in another part of the city to support another important cause. Yes, there was lots of shouting, but this time it wasn’t in frustration or anger — it was shouts of jubilation and pride. After 44 years of struggle,…
I’ve grown over these past three years to enjoy braille. Every time I use my braille writer or slate and stylus to write, it’s hard to stop. Braille is great for me because I have glaucoma, a progressive eye condition that could blind me, so I must learn braille for my future as well as my braille teaching career. Glaucoma doesn’t scare me because I have braille as a back up in my life toolbox. Whenever I read a braille book with my blindfold on, I can find a mysterious…
I work at a non-profit organization that trains guide dogs for the visually impaired. As a “puppy Kindergarten manager,” I coordinate with dedicated volunteers and staff members to create a good foundation for our puppies who will grow up to be companions and guides.

Then, at about 12 weeks old, our puppies go home with volunteer puppy-raisers for just over a year to be exposed to a…
My name is Dave Steele.

I was born totally blind from a rare genetic condition known as Leber’s congenital amaurosis (LCA); because of this, I’ve been thrown lots of curveballs in my life. I’ve been bullied in school to the point of…

Yep, pretty typical. But my kiddos also each have a certain, not-so-typical aspect that makes them, well, them. Many people describe my children as extraordinary. But I don’t. High achievers? Yes. Resilient? You bet. But extraordinary? No.
However, it is my expectations for them and their expectations of how their lives will go that are extraordinary, and that is the game changer in our house.
Dictionary.com defines the word “extraordinary” as “beyond what is usual, ordinary, regular, or established.” An additional word used for extraordinary here is “remarkable.” My children have some qualities and experiences that are definitely different from other people – and at first I didn’t realize just how remarkable a life we would have because of that.
For a while I could only see the ordinary things my children did not experience like everyone else. I did not have the extraordinary or “beyond what is usual” expectation that they would indeed do the things they wanted to do because, unfortunately, the ordinary, usual way of thinking about my kiddos’ future was pretty bleak.
You see, my two sons (Michael, 17 and Mitchell, 14) are blind – and my daughter (Karissa, 13) was born into a family of full inclusion for them.
My boys have a rare inherited eye disease, LCA-CRB1. When I received the first of the double diagnoses seventeen years ago, all I could think of was, “He will never play baseball. He will never keep up with other kids. He will never drive.” I thought of all the childhood things my son would miss out on. I sobbed over my visions of him never having a full life.
Here’s the thing: I had never met a blind person before. Ever. I wasn’t given a handbook or even a pamphlet on how to raise a blind child. All I knew about blindness was nothing at all. With no experience with blindness, and no role models of success, my perception was that blindness was dark and devastating. Therefore, I expected a life of challenge and hardship. Unfortunately, everyone I knew had the same bleak outlook for my children.
I felt alone in my journey raising two blind children, however I was definitely not alone in my ordinary expectation of what their lives would be like.
I am by nature an optimistic person, so it was against my DNA to be living in such pessimism with a bleak outlook on the future. I knew that living in devastation wouldn’t get me and my boys very far, so I put on my happy face and marched off the couch and into life with blind children.
As I climbed out of the devastation ditch I was in, I came across the story about a man named Erik Weihenmeyer who had recently climbed to the summit of Mount Everest – and he is completely blind.
His story began to shift my perception of blindness, which changed my expectation of what might be possible for my blind sons. If Erik could manage climbing a mountain without sight, surely my guys could figure out preschool, right?
That shift in perception and expectations worked – Michael sailed through “regular” preschool. He had great social skills and was the happiest kid in his classes. I’d like to say Michael’s story of greatness began here and we had smooth sailing into the future… but my life’s challenges pretty much never have the easy-breezy, “Disney style” happy endings.
Although Michael had less than ten percent of the vision a sighted child had, he wasn’t expected to learn Braille because “he had so much vision that he’d fight it,” the professionals said. He was never introduced to the white cane because the professionals said, “You’re with him all the time and can hold his hand.” And when he got to Kindergarten, the Individualized Education Plan (IEP) team told me that Michael would only be expected to “find his cubby seventy percent of the time.” I knew we had a massive problem on our hands.
My son, like millions of other blind people, was only expected to have, at best, seventy percent of a full life. I was so not cool with that.
As I was scouring the internet for support groups, associations for the blind, and pretty much any and every one of the scarce resources I could get my hands on to find the tools of blindness my guys needed, I stumbled upon stories of blind adults that were succeeding without sight. I read about blind runners, musicians, and business leaders. I learned about assistive technology, Braille and mobility training. Wow, wow and wow!
My expectations for my sons’ lives were reaching new heights – but I was still sitting in IEP meetings where seventy percent was the goal.
And then a pivotal moment in my #MomLife: I found the statistic that took my breath away. Nearly seventy percent of blind people are unemployed. Seventy percent. Unemployed.
Seventy percent achievement looked darn good in a niche where only thirty percent were thriving! Seventy percent unemployment rate to me screams “CRISIS!” – but nobody else seemed alarmed.
Many, many people were screaming “CRISIS!” over a glass ceiling that was holding them and their children down, but no one seemed to care that my children weren’t being held down by just a ceiling – they were put in an entire box of non-achievement and hopelessness.
My boys needed to break out of the box, the stigma, that so many people around this world have for blind people. They had to soar beyond the usual, ordinary expectation that blind people cannot live as full a life as a sighted person. I had to set the extraordinary expectation that my guys could and would pursue the lives of their dreams and get them the tools they needed to do so.
We started with that Kindergarten IEP team. It took a while, but eventually the team agreed that the goals for Michael and later Mitchell had to be as far from the old ways as possible. If they were missing the cubby, or not reading at or above grade level, or falling behind in Honors Biology, strategies needed to be put in place to teach him how to succeed 100% of the time.
I had the extraordinary expectation that my boys would achieve their goals, pursue their interests, and be kind, thoughtful and productive community members.
The results? Well, they are both in high school and they are thriving – not just as blind children, but as kids in general.
They pursue their passions, they try new things, they excel at schoolwork, they have ups and they have downs. We are still learning the tools of blindness every day and we still constantly reach out to blind role models.
Michael is looking forward to college and Mitchell keeps everyone laughing. And just like so many brothers, they could not be more different – I think the only thing they have in common is their passion for our Philadelphia Eagles football team!
As for my daughter, well, the impact of living a life of full inclusion of her blind brothers was so extraordinary that I dedicated time in my recent TEDx talk to it.
I expect my children, the blind and the sighted, to pursue their passions and achieve their dreams. I expect that they each will achieve their personal greatness. And you know what? All three of my children expect that of themselves. That expectation is outside the norm of what many others hold for my kiddos – and I enjoy watching my gang open people’s eyes and minds every single day. It is, indeed, extraordinary.

With the losses and the bounces in weight... I came out with a 2 pound net loss for August 2012. This makes 4 months of consecutive weight loss.
This time I am gradually taking excess fat off my body. I did think I would be dropping weight faster than this... but then I have not been doing any intense cardio either. J
I need to add in some Hip Hop Abs and/or Turbo Jam... keeping it low impact is a must... and I can adjust both of those to low impact... well keeping it low impact is a must if I intend to continue being able to walk... so yes I would say it is a must.
Even the tread mill is questionable with my right knee. I took the speed up too high and the knee went. So I'll just keep it slower and gradually rebuild the muscles around the knee. Twisting steps are a problem as well. Tends to pull the knees out of alignment... If I'm careful I think I can do the Hip Hop Abs... I am sure Turbo jam would work for me. I will stick with the lightest level and pace myself.
Well here is cheers to 2 pounds net loss... I would have rather it have been 20... but hey I'll take the 2 pounds... yeah!

This morning there is a fog… the kind of fog that dragons relish… thick warm moist fog… not the bone chilling stuff of a winter’s morn… but the caressing fog of the wee hours of a summer’s dawn… moisture dripping ever so slowly from the trees… soaking into every crack and crevice the sun and wind have left behind… nourishing moisture for the life of the trees and dragon folk…
Not the pelting driving rain of flash floods… not so long past… rains that do as much damage as good… but the gentle caress of a warm fog… shutting out the outside world… wrapping all in its shroud of wet gray freedom…
You can hear them you know… rumbling as they dash about and play in the freedom of the gray… a rumbling roar that echoes through the hills… feel them as the ground vibrates from their antics… no fires today… only play…
There are stories of olde… of dragons at play… dancing and leaping into the sky… red… purple… and yellow of eye… colures shifting as they blink… blink away… into the nether regions of Ire…
Stories of their wing-spans filling the sky… great hordes of dragons in flight… moving the air below from their wings might…
There are fewer now… or so seem to be… never seen one in flight… I’ve heard tell in the minstrels’ delight… seen such woven in the Tapestry’s tale hung in the even glow light…
Now they come only in the fog… happy sounds in the warm summer morn… screeching in pain… in the cold fog of north winters morn…
Its summer now… so a warm fog blesses the hills with the dragons dance… I’m drawn to their sounds as a moth to the flame…
The elders huddle in fear as they hear their morning games… I wonder if their fear is to keep us contained… huddled in houses… free only in name…
There are others among them… others like me… with the dream to be free… like me but changed… their garb bright and gleaming… unlike the drab colors of the elder folk…
It seems I’ve been chosen… to ride or be dined upon… which would it be… face my fear …it’s clutching at my heart… the drive to be free overpowering it’s binding grasp… I step forward… towards my chosen fate…
Am I food … foe… or friend… tis soon to be seen… I can feel her breath on my face… her great eyes so bright… the swirling colours slowing to a deep solid purple… focused on me… still … looking… seeming to judge… am I found to be lacking and as such … merely food… or worthy of life… and as such friend… welcome to fly upon this great beasts back… to blink to Ire and never look back…
Standing still am I…face to face … eye to eye… with this great beast so golden… time seems to stop… in a moment frozen…
A choice is made… a move so quickly as to appear invisible… I am lifted high… yet to know food or friend… but sure in my risk… freedom in the dragons’ dance is truly to be blessed… either way I’m free not bound by elders’ quest...
My seat it seems … tis at the base of this great beast’s neck… as she deposits me… hence the grasp of her razor edged jaws with nary scratch… seems I’m friend rather than food… bonded now with this golden beast…
The warm morning fog is lifting… Skyward we rise… as one in the air… wings rustling as music… so swift is our rise… blinked into Ire…
Precisely what is Streaming video? Basically, It does not take series of images and sounds that are being transmitted in one source to another location. In the operation, the viewer see becoming a show or perhaps animation.
Television stations and channels can be a method to obtain streaming video. So, we could say that we're already using streaming video prior to the creation of the web.
Everybody is already providing streaming videos on his or her websites. Together with the availability of websites including YouTube and Metacafe, everyone is seeing and expecting video streams on website. Therefore, more and more people will websites that show streaming films.
What's the advantage of video streaming? One clear advantage is that there's no must wait lengthy as a way to view their streaming video. Therefore, internet viewers can easily enjoy watching these movie clips with no need to download them for the local computer.
Another advantage is always that streaming of videos making it more unlikely for computers to get infected with the downloading of video files. Due to this, a lot of people use streaming video to avoid this potential problem.
Not just are individuals or small websites use streaming videos, many large establishments may also be incorporating streaming video within their websites. We could understand the prevalence and usefulness of video stream everywhere. Down the road, static websites might be getting lesser and lesser.

High-octane geldings grabbed the market and gripped a front and center presence during the October 26 "Fall Special Catalog Sale" event and regular monthly horse sale at Billings Livestock Commission Company.
Gathering up 15 out of the top 20 selling positions, all-business geldings governed the market, with the fit, fancy, and finished kind continuing to meet solid demand.
He’d been through school and worked for a living and Hip 114 "Buddy" a 95 grade gray gelding consigned by Tim and Jackie Bernstein, Faith, SD had been headed, heeled, and breakaway roped on - and did it all again in Saturday morning’s preview - in addition to seeing some long day’s dragging calves to the fire.
Consigned by Marc Matlick, Rapid City, SD, Hip 105 "Mitos Houdini" a 97 AQHA gray gelding x Mito Cody came with a solid ranching background and showed ‘em all in the rope horse preview that he was well started heading.
They always ride a good horse and Ediger Quarter Horses, Wolf Point, MT purchased the stout, everything in order gelding for $4,900.
A seasoned show horse, "Invitational" a 95 AQHA sorrel gelding x Invitation Only and out of a granddaughter of Doc Prescription and The Investor, came complete with a good attitude and his AQHA points.
Offered by Tina Elmer Morris, Colbert, WA, the "gentle for youth or amateur" gelding brought a final bid of $7,000 and sold to Ann Wells, Victor, ID.
All-in-all, the top five geldings - all with solid backgrounds and chosen careers - averaged $5,000.
The 2002 AQHA Bay stallion x Sunfrost was out of a daughter of Wilywood that was out of a daughter of Freckles Playboy.
With pedigree to burn from three of the industry’s top breeding programs, the real stallion prospect was brought to BLS by Mike and Tammy Hollibaugh, Hollibaugh Flying Heart Ranch, Chadron, NE and purchased by Tim Goodman, Greenfield, MO.
Riding like a million-bucks with a mere 20 rides, the bred to run-the-barrels mare was eligible for five barrel futurities and sold to Jake Clark, Powell, WY for $5,000.
Catalog sale averages breakdown as follows - top five brought $5,790; top ten at $4,830; Top 20 came in at $3,810; and the top fifty averaged $2,626.
A rampant loose horse trade tells its own tale with the top loose horse of the day fetching $1,825, followed by $1,700, $1,475, and $1,250.
Rhyme and reason being a full slate of buyers in attendance at BLS - from top-end to bottom-end - from prospects to recipients - from riders to buckers - the buyers are on the seats to buy them "as is, how is" and that’s why the top five on the loose averaged $1,500 across the board, with the top ten commanding $1,290, the top 20 at $1,068, top 50 came in at $857, while top 100 loose horses averaged an unprecedented $699 each.
Featured loose horses included an offering from three separate bucking horse producers - from South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming.
Billings Livestock’s next sale event is set for November 23 and will feature the "Holiday Special Catalog Sale" and regular monthly horse sale.
Here’s some copy that I sent to Lonnie Klein, the conductor of the Las Cruces Symphony, which commissioned this piece in honor of the 100th anniversary of New Mexico’s becoming a state in 1912.
The dedication reads: For Dr. Lonnie Klein and the Las Cruces Symphony and to all the brave new citizens of New Mexico, past, present and to come.
The opportunity to experience the masterful playing of musicians that fill a stage from end-to-end — a true, full-scale orchestra on tour — is becoming increasingly rare. This is the opportunity! Conducted by the dynamic and expressive Antoni Wit, featuring the 2010 International Chopin Piano Competition winner Yulianna Avdeeva, the Warsaw Philharmonic’s performance of Beethoven’s final piano concerto, the Emperor Concerto, and Tchaikovsky’s last completed symphony, Pathétique, will be the kind of concert we rarely see outside of major cities these days…grand and soaring.
Bill is delighted to announce his residency this November as a guest of the Hansen Musical Arts Series, College of Musical Arts, Bowling Green University.
We do not have many 1/2 sales tax opportunities, so we better be very careful the money goes 100% for real solutions. Bruce McPherson supports a highly wasteful spending of the $450 million proposed November tax measure which fully support of the "TRAIN BOONDOGGLE". It wastes $68 million on this parallel road needed for the bike path, which has to be setback 20' from the tracks. Much of the tracks a smack dab in the middle of the easement. That "road" has to be completely ripped out and rebuilt over to the other side. If you go along with this, you can expect more tax measures in order to build this Train, which basically has minority of people who would actually use the train and be better served with an improved METRO bus system.
I do not believe people realize what the recently purchased railroad corridor is going to look like, after spending millions of our money. Essentially, to us Civil Engineers, the bike path and the train, require a road. A structure, underneath, to support it. Problem is, the existing tracks a in the middle of the easment, so they will have to be completely removed and rebuilt to one side. The opposite side cleared and leveled for the "road" for the bike path. The photos above are of the existing tracks covered by an asphalt surface, and will cost a fraction of the cost with no effect on the environment. The proposed, Rail + Trail, will have hugh impact on the landscape, leveling up to 100' wide, taking out existing tree lined landscaped as shown on the pictures above. Passenger rail is great, where it works. Here it does not. The train cars partially full, with a 14 million dollar tab to keep it running every year. Bruce McPherson voted on a tax measure to support a funding a 127 million bike path, which is parallel to the tracks, preserving them, and not necessary. Over removed tracks, the bike path is far superior, and at a fraciton of the cost of YOUR MONEY!
1. Draft two new Tax Measures, one directed at Highway One, the other, with all the improvements which are very cost effective, including building the picture on the left. It will also cover improving METRO and all other improvements we need much more than a TRAIN BOONDOGGLE!
2. Address the concerns of the "Anti-Widening" group, which I agree with. Their main, basic, argurment is that we will spend this enormous amount of money, (might be as much as $600 K), widening the Highway, and several years in the future, the gridlock will happen from more cars. More cars can only come from two,2, sources.
They will tell you that there are some provisions in the Measure that you won’t like, but you have to pass it anyway otherwise we will have nothing. They are unable to craft a Measure, which the majority will agree on, which does not waste any money and/or fixes the problem(s) permanently. So, a vote for McPherson includes having the congestion on Highway 1, and continuing and finding additional funding for bike paths when we could save our money thrown in the firebox of this train.
If elected, I will have a measure drafted that isolates the Highway 1 issue. We need to address the Anti-Widening contingent's concerns, which I happen to agree with. They would support widening if the highway did not simply fill up with cars after spending a lot of money for widening. More cars, they claim, would come from two reasons. One is urban sprawl. Basically, the relieved congestion will attract more growth. Second, because the congestion will be relieved, locals will start driving more simply because before they avoided driving at those times during commute hours. I have solutions to these problems, and the anti-widening group will no longer have anything to support their argument, and this Measure will pass:
1. Urban Sprawl: The new Water District will have the power to limit the number of water service connections. There will still be room for some more growth, however this District will create a sustainable water model, capable of withstanding a severe drought, and the discussion of exactly how many people we believe is sustainable in the County, and what future generations will see. Now, we completely ignore this problem, do nothing, and punish the commuters who sit in this traffic with idling polluting cars when they could get home an hour sooner.
2. I don't believe locals will drive more just because the congestion is relieved. However, if this is true, there are other ways to solve this problem. One is to make the Highway either have express lanes or make it a toll road. Commuters would pay for Fastrack type beacons that will permit access on the freeway during critical times. The new 32-mile long Bike Path will help enormously for the locals tempted to drive; they will take a bike instead.
With both of these proposals in place. A measure will be drafted to include Cal Trans recommended Tier 1 &2 improvements and the congestion will be gone! PROBLEM SOLVED!
McPherson's supported moronic Tax Measure also includes what I call the TRAIN BOONDOGGLE! The proposed train has no freight to haul, not a major commute route and not in a densely populated area like San Jose, where passenger train does work. On their admission, the RTC stated that it does NOTHING to end HWY1 congestion. I ask anyone to either go down and walk the tracks or look at online pictures or videos of the corridor. Have the 3 photo sketches with you showing the setback distances. The path, over removed tracks, is very easy to envision. Just imagine the tracks as an asphalt bike back and compacted sandy clay pedestrian trail. No one would argue this would be absolutely magnificent.
Now, it’s harder to envision Rail + Trail, but let’s try. The land will have to leveled and cleared about 40 feet wide flat. This is a massive land clearing operation. You will no doubt notice that much of the tracks are smack dab in the middle of the easement. Those tracks will have to be completely removed, i.e. tracks, ties, sub-grade, and rebuilt over to one side. The same construction needed bike path on the opposite side. Not only will this be extremely ugly, it will be very expensive. They have no engineered drawings, and are basically lying to you that the tab will be 125 million, which is not an accurate estimate; it’s a “guesstimate”.
Believe me, as a 25 + year senior heavy construction estimator, I’m qualified to make that call. In addition, they studied the amount of ridership, and they determined that it would require up to an additional 14.7 million every year to operate and maintain. An enormous amount of your money could go to more effective transportation causes then to get wasted with this plan.
The alternative is to have the 32-mile long bike path/pedestrian trail for 25 million built over removed tracks. So, using their 125 million guesstimate, we can save over 100 million to build bike paths all over the county, including ones that we need in District Five. That is why we need to oppose this Measure!
If elected I will support the restructuring the Transportation Commission so that its only job is to work for the locals, and not theirs or the State's agenda. Finally, my "Recycle Plan" requires not using the corridor for the train. Large water mains are not allowed going along RR tracks because a blowout could lead to a catastrophic derailment. My "Recycle Plan" solves all water issues for coastal residents, and they do not need to steal any more water out of our District, which they are planning. The poorly designed Felton Diversion Dam will be removed, (Pat Liteky smiling in his casket), and replaced with a flood control pump station/fish viewer, improving, not harming the fish habitat, (see my "Storm Aquarries" plan).

Standard Scores are scores that have a fixed mean and standard deviation in the population of examinees. A Standard Score indicates how many units of the standard deviation a particular score is above or below the mean. In the case of the ASVAB subtests, the mean is set to 50 and the standard deviation is set to 10. Thus, a Standard Score of 40 indicates that the examinee scored 1 standard deviation below the mean. A Standard Score of 70 indicates that the examinee scored 2 standard deviations above the mean. To learn more about how standard scores are derived and used, click here.

One difficult matter in the relation between military and society is control and transparency. In some countries, limited information on military operations and budgeting is accessible for the public. However transparency in the military sector is crucial to fight corruption. This showed the Government Defence Anti-corruption Index Transparency International UK published in 2013.[39]

International protocols restrict the use, or have even created international bans on weapons, notably weapons of mass destruction (WMD). International conventions define what constitutes a war crime, and provides for war crimes prosecution. Individual countries also have elaborate codes of military justice, an example being the United States' Uniform Code of Military Justice that can lead to court martial for military personnel found guilty of war crimes.
Each year, many high school and postsecondary students take the free Armed Services Vocational Aptitude battery (ASVAB). The ASVAB is the most widely used multiple-aptitude test battery in the world. It consists of eight tests that measure your skills and abilities in the following areas: General Science; Arithmetic Reasoning; World Knowledge; Paragraph Comprehension; Mathematics Knowledge; Electronics Information; Auto and Shop Information; Mechanical Comprehension.
Mathematics Knowledge tests the ability to solve problems by applying knowledge of mathematical concepts and applications. The problems focus on concepts and algorithms, and involve number theory, numeration, algebraic operations and equations, geometry, measurement and probability. Mathematics Knowledge is one factor that characterizes mathematics comprehension; it also assesses logical thinking.
This will show you exactly what your weak areas are, and where you need to devote more study time. Ask yourself why each of these questions gave you trouble. Was it because you didn’t understand the material? Was it because you didn’t remember the vocabulary? Do you need more repetitions on this type of question to build speed and confidence? Dig into those questions and figure out how you can strengthen your weak areas as you go back to review the material.

In complete honesty, one can say that the test identifies with an entire life's worth of knowledge. It essentially pulls from 3 different aspects. First, it draws from concrete facts that were acquired from all areas of a person's educational career. Secondly, it draws from a person’s ability to comprehend and use context clues to make assumptions. Lastly, it draws from a person’s physical/verbal skills to see if they can properly administer those more physical aspects. Overall this is why people have identified it as the “SAT on steroids.”
The bonus disc alone makes this worth most of the price. The Hollywood High live songs (9 of them) are amazingly well recorded, very energetic great performance, with an enthusiastic crowd that doesn't intrude on the music. If you remember the live "El Mocambo" bonus disc that was part of an EC boxed set several years ago, well this is FAR better than that. The Hollywood High set alone could have been released as a great live CD, possibly the only reason it wasn't was because it would be seen as too short. The "bonus disc" here has other songs (B sides, etc.) not from the original "Armed Forces" which are worthy and interesting as well.

In addition, SOC operates ConAP (Concurrent Admissions Program) to increase college enrollment of Army enlistees (Army and Army Reserves). ConAP allows you to enlist in the Army at the same time as you apply for college. DANTES also operates its own Distance Learning Program. For more information, contact:
Later this became known as military science, and later still, would adopt the scientific method approach to the conduct of military operations under the influence of the Industrial Revolution thinking. In his seminal book On War, the Prussian Major-General and leading expert on modern military strategy, Carl von Clausewitz defined military strategy as 'the employment of battles to gain the end of war'.[36] According to Clausewitz:
Although mostly concerned with the military transport, as a means of delivery using different modes of transport; from military trucks, to container ships operating from permanent military base, it also involves creating field supply dumps at the rear of the combat zone, and even forward supply points in specific unit's Tactical Area of Responsibility.
There are many misconceptions about what it’s like to serve in the U.S. military. If you don’t know any soldiers personally, you might think of the military as a place for infantry, trudging though rough terrain and loading giant artillery. Although that may have been true in the past, today’s military offers many opportunities that aren’t readily apparent to the typical high school graduate. For example, there are jobs in aviation mechanics, medicine, and accounting. There are also peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts by the United States military that require skills in verbal and written communication. Taking the exam can help you determine if you would be well-suited to one of these occupations.
Arithmetic Reasoning tests the ability to solve basic arithmetic problems encountered in everyday life. One-step and multistep word problems require addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and choosing the correct order of operations when more than one step is necessary. The items include operations with whole numbers, operations with rational numbers, ratio and proportion, interest, percentage and measurement. Arithmetic Reasoning is one factor that helps characterize mathematics comprehension, and it also assesses logical thinking.
The Mathematics Knowledge section of the exam measures your knowledge of various math areas, such as algebra and geometry. You may be asked to find the square root of a number or the volume of a brick with given dimensions. Algebraic problems may require finding the value of “y” in a given equation. A review of math symbols—such as ≠, ≤, and √—can help you solve the given problems much faster, and using our ASVAB math study guide to practice answering the algebra and geometry questions on the test can help increase your overall AFQT score. The CAT-ASVAB has 16 questions in 20 minutes; the paper-and-pencil version has 25 questions in 24 minutes.
Soldiers and armies have been prominent in popular culture since the beginnings of recorded history. In addition to the countless images of military leaders in heroic poses from antiquity, they have been an enduring source of inspiration in war literature. Not all of this has been entirely complementary, and the military have been lampooned or ridiculed as often as they have been idolised. The classical Greek writer Aristophanes, devoted an entire comedy, Lysistrata, to a strike organised by military wives, where they withhold sex from their husbands to prevent them from going to war.
The President, Secretary of Defense and other senior executive officials are advised by a seven-member Joint Chiefs of Staff, which is headed by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest-ranking officer in the United States military and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.[20] The rest of the body is composed of the heads of each of the DoD's service branches (the Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commandant of the Marine Corps and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force) as well as the Chief of the National Guard Bureau. Although commanding one of the five military branches, the Commandant of the Coast Guard is not a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Despite being composed of the highest-ranking officers in each of the respective branches, the Joint Chiefs of Staff does not possess operational command authority. Rather, the Goldwater-Nichols Act charges them only with advisory power.[21]
A military brat is a colloquial term for a child with at least one parent who served as an active duty member (vice reserve) in the armed forces. Children of armed forces members may move around to different military bases or international postings, which gives them a childhood differing from the norm. Unlike common usage of the term brat, when it is used in this context, it is not necessarily a derogatory term.
The underlying model used for the ASVAB is a three-parameter logistic (3PL) model. This model represents the probability that an examinee at a given level of ability will respond correctly to an individual item with given characteristics. The characteristics used are difficulty, discrimination and guessing (this refers to the likelihood that a very low ability examinee would respond correctly simply by guessing).
If you are enlisting in the military, good - a patriotic journey, where you can build skills and see the world. However there is one thing your recruiter didn't tell you. Your ability to get into a department that you want, depends on how well you can take a quiz - just like you did with the SAT, or whatever those test are called in current times. Those test asked those really stupid questions about the cost of ice cream if a train leaves New York at 4:00 and it is 20 degrees on Colorado. This book will teach you how to answer those ridiculous questions that WILL control your destiny. Get a copy and memorize it... then serving your country will lead to a great career.
Alongside this, World War II also inspired films as varied as The Dam Busters, 633 Squadron, Bridge on the River Kwai, The Longest Day, Catch-22, Saving Private Ryan, and The Sea Shall Not Have Them. The next major event, the Korean War inspired a long-running television series M*A*S*H. With the Vietnam War, the tide of balance turned, and its films, notably Apocalypse Now, Good Morning, Vietnam, Go Tell the Spartans, Born on the Fourth of July, and We Were Soldiers, have tended to contain critical messages.
Don’t be fooled by the appearance of the low numbers, the algorithm that computes the AFQT is very sophisticated. Just because your ASVAB score is 40 doesn’t mean that you only got 40% of the questions correct, it could simply mean that you lack strength in one area, but succeed with high praise in another. Your ASVAB score is only a means by which you are categorized for available positions; it is by no means a measure of intelligence.
25.	Use the following passage to answer questions 25 and 26. Sarah is about to fly from New York to Los Angeles. She packs the night before and checks her list three times. Anxiety keeps her from sleeping well. The next morning, she accidentally puts salt in her coffee instead of sugar. She forgets her purse and has to go back to the house to get it. Finally, she arrives at the airport just in time to catch her flight. The flight is uneventful, and soon Sarah is landing at LAX. Her sister is waiting for her. What was the main idea of this passage?
Are you thinking about joining the Army, Navy, Marines, or Air Force? Maybe you want to cook or write or handle explosives. Maybe you want to deal with advanced technology or pilot a drone. Whatever your military dream job, we can help you turn that dream into reality. Here at ASVABTutor, we provide the practice tests and study guides that will help you prepare to ace the Armed Forces Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB).
The IRT model underlying ASVAB scoring is the three-parameter logistic (3PL) model. The 3PL model represents the probability that an examinee at a given level of ability will respond correctly to an individual item with given characteristics. Specifically, the item characteristics represented in the 3PL model are difficulty, discrimination (i.e., how well the item discriminates among examinees of differing levels of ability), and guessing (i.e., the likelihood that a very low ability examinee would respond correctly simply by guessing).
There are different minimum AFQT score requirements for enlisting in the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Coast Guard, although requirements will vary depending upon whether you have a high school diploma or a GED. Minimum score requirements change on a fairly regular basis, with higher scores being required during times of above-average enlistment levels. Enlistment bonuses, which are determined by your choice of military occupation, may also be influenced by AFQT scores.
The AFQT score is a percentile score. What does that mean? In 1997, a study, known as the "Profile of American Youth," was conducted by the Department of Defense in cooperation with the Department of Labor. DOD administered the ASVAB to around 12,000 individuals, ranging in age from 16 to 23. Your AFQT score is a comparison of how well you scored on the four subtests, compared to those who took the ASVAB as part of the 1997 survey. In other words, if you have an AFQT score of 70, that means you scored as well or better than 70 percent of those 12,000 folks.
There is another ASVAB score that's equally important, if not more so, because it is the score that determines if a person is eligible for military service. It's the Armed Forces Qualification Test score, or AFQT score. This score is calculated from only four of the nine Standard Scores on the ASVAB - Arithmetic Reasoning (AR), Mathematics Knowledge (MK), Paragraph Comprehension (PC), and Word Knowledge (WK). First, the WK and PC scores are added together, then the sum is doubled. This is known as the Verbal Expression (VE) score. The VE, MK, and AR scores are then added together, and the sum is the AFQT. This score is a straight percentile measure, expressed as a number from 1-99. The number is the percentage of people who scored lower than the test taker. For example, if a person receives an AFQT score of 63, that means that he did better on the test than 63% of the people who have taken it.
I thought I was just buying an extra book, that I would most likely not put attention to. But, it was not. This book is filled with practice questions, which I got to study before hand thanks to the "2015 / 2016 ASVAB For Dummies". These two books makes a great combination. One to study and the other to test how far you have improved by testing yourself. I am glad I bought it. I recommend it to everyone who is thinking of taking the ASVAB or the AFQT. Just have in mind, that this book is all about questions, of course it will give you the correct answer in the back of it, but it will not go into detail as much as the "2015 / 2016 ASVAB For Dummies" book.
You can take the test as a junior or senior in high school and use the score to enlist, provided that you are at least 17 years old and took the test no earlier than 2 years before you begin enlistment processing. If you are at least 17, you can take the test at a Military Processing Station (MEP) or a satellite Military Entrance Test (MET) location.

Summary: At forty-two, Harry Potter finally felt it was safe to relax and enjoy his life, until his own life-long inability to resist a puzzle gets him into the sort of trouble only Severus Snape can fix.
Author's Notes: I'm not certain this is what you meant when you said plotty, Meri, but it was most definitely inspired by your prompt: 42 year old Harry must court/marry Snape for some very good reason. Hope you enjoy it. Happy Snarry Holidays to you! Betas to be revealed, but you know who you are and I thank you! So much love.
Toronto, Ontario, October 4th, 2017 – Aurania Resources Ltd. (TSXV: ARU) (“Aurania” or the “Company”) is pleased to report that its on-the-ground exploration on the Lost Cities – Cutucu Project in southeastern Ecuador is advancing well. Progress on the project includes:
Completion of acquisition of geophysical data from 70% of the planned survey area. The geophysical program is expected to be completed in late October;
A field office has been established in the town of Macas from which the field teams are being deployed to mobile fly-camps that are to be moved every few days as the exploration advances;
The exploration team has been expanded to include seven field geologists working closely with a specialist environmental and community relations team of four; and
The first batch of stream sediment samples has been submitted to the laboratory and analyses are expected in late October.
The heliborne geophysics program is over two-thirds complete and the program is expected to be concluded in late October. The program has been affected by unusually cloudy weather, and since the helicopter undertakes the survey at a ground clearance of only 60 metres, the survey must be conducted in near-perfect weather conditions. However, we remain on-budget. Data from the survey are being processed and analyzed by an independent consultant working directly for Aurania as well as by MPX Geophysics Ltd, the Canadian company that has been contracted to undertake the survey.
Logistical support for the exploration program has been established in the town of Macas, the seat of local government, located 13 kilometres from the project area. The exploration teams are being provisioned in Macas and then transported to the river basin where the stream sediment sampling and geological reconnaissance is to be done. Each team will move up-river as sampling progresses, relocating its mobile tented camp every few days. Additional provisions will be sourced from local communities where possible, or from the logistics base using mules to transport the goods.
The on-site exploration team has been increased to seven geologists, six of whom are Ecuadorian. The entire exploration team is involved in the stream sediment sampling program at this time. As targets are identified from the combination of historical data, geophysics, satellite image interpretation and stream sediment sampling and mapping, the three senior geologists will undertake the more detailed exploration of those sites. The foreign geologist in the team, Bart Wilson has over 17 years of exploration in South America and was involved in the early-stage exploration that led to the discovery of the Fruta Del Norte gold deposit in the geologically contiguous belt in southeastern Ecuador.
The exploration team is working in close association with two local environmental scientists and two local community relations specialists whom have already proven to be very effective in building a local team as well as developing open communication with local communities.
The first batch of stream sediment samples from the concession area has been delivered to the preparation laboratory in Quito, Ecuador, before being sent for analysis in Lima, Peru. These samples will be analyzed for metal enrichment that can be indicative of mineralization located upstream of the sample point.

So far, so good. Borderland has remained secure since I cleaned it up yesterday. And no more malware warnings from Google. Yay!
I’ve been delinquent, I know. No posts for a long time. Just busy being me…. and then yesterday I read a post from Steve, another Alaskan blogger, reporting on a message he received from one of his readers telling him about a warning message which said that whatdoino.steve.blogspot.com has content from borderland.northernattitude.org, a well-known malware distributor.
Later on, curious, I looked at my blog and got blasted with the warning myself. I didn’t know what was going on, since I haven’t worked on the blog for such a long time. I clicked past the Warning – visiting this web site may harm your computer! message, and found the formatting on the control panel was totally gone. There was no way to make anything happen there. The blog’s front page didn’t look bad, though.
Eventually, I decided to log onto the web host’s cpanel and check some of the WordPress files. Lots of strange code there which had a monster string of text following “eval base64_decode” in dozens of files mostly in my wp-content directory, and also in the config file. These are all files that are left as-is during software upgrades since they contain the themes and plugins that allow users to customize their blogs. A regular software update wouldn’t touch them.
My first thought was, “Oh well, this might help with some of my writer’s block angst. I could just trash the whole thing.” But that was just my first thought. I looked at the WordPress support pages and located a My Site was Hacked advice page. All right. Some direction, at least.
For starters, I ran some Sophos Anti-Virus software I found on my computer to see if my own machine was OK. It located a couple of files squirreled away in the Firefox profile directory that should not have been there. I dumped them, and then took care of the infected files on the server. I deleted ALL of the WordPress files and rebuilt the whole site today with a new config file. I took some precautions against repeated attacks, but I have no idea if this fix will hold. I’ve lost the links page, and there are probably several posts without images, since I recklessly deleted everything wholesale. I got back the posts and the comments, which is all that really mattered to me.
I’ve requested a Malware Review, but I don’t know how long it might take to clean this mess up. Anyone with a link in their blogroll here should probably delete it, since the google warning might mess with traffic to that site. Otherwise, know that I’m working on it, and to the best of my knowledge, it’s been dealt with. I’m sorry for any trouble this might be causing anyone else. I’m really grateful to Steve for his post about this, and for the helpful email he sent me. According to my server log, most of the mischief was done just a couple of days ago.
Borderland is on ice for now. (Not that it’s been very hot here lately.) I’ve backed everything up and locked things down, but I don’t know if the hackers still have a way in. I can re-install everything in quick order now that I know what to do. But I’m not ready to write more here just yet.
I started a new blog at WordPress.com, where I won’t have to think about server-level security issues. I plan to blog there until further notice. Just a “Hello World” post up there now. I’m going to take a little more eclectic approach to the subject matter there than I have with Borderland, and see how it goes. Might be fun.
Responding to a question from an audience member as to why Social Security should be included in deficit talks when it doesn"™t add to the deficit, Romney drifted into a defense of corporate rights.
Romney said in Iowa that Obama "œwants another stimulus, he wants to hire more government workers. He says we need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers. Did he not get the message of Wisconsin? The American people did. It"™s time for us to cut back on government and help the American people."
It was what they were all about, Levon and the rest of The Band, in 1968, when the country was coming apart at the seams. Nothing was holding, least of all Mr. Yeats’s center. There were tanks in Prague and there was blood on a balcony in Memphis, Tennessee. The traditional American values of home and family and neighborhood were being fashioned into cheap weapons to use against the people who saw the death and gore as the deepest kind of betrayal of the ideals that made those values worth a damn in the first place. The music was disparate and fragmented; the Beatles were producing masterpieces that they couldn’t or wouldn’t take on the road. Brian Wilson was long gone, spelunking through the canyons of what was left of his mind. Jim Morrison, that tinpot fraud, was mixing bullshit politics with kindergarten Freudian mumbo-jumbo and his band didn’t even have a damn bass player. Elsewhere, there was torpid, silly psychedelia. The British were sort of holding it together, but, in America, even soul was coming apart. Nothing seemed rooted. Nothing abided. Nothing seemed to come from anything else. The whole country was bleeding from wounds nobody could find.
Pierce’s magnificent tribute to what he calls the “true Voice of America” was inspired by an announcement on Levon Helm’s website that he is in the final stages of his battle with cancer.
It was a summoning of the idea of the American community, which has never been about conformity, either to fashion or to the politics of the moment. And, if you didn’t get the point, there were some sly hints on the record that pointed you back towards what was important, that made you realize that there was an America worth the effort of finding, that there was a country to which it was worth coming home.
Thank you, Charles. And thank you, Levon Helm, for your music, your voice. You know it’s never been easy. We’ll do our best.
The plain fact is that the planet does not need more “successful” people. But it does desperately need more peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers, and lovers of every shape and form. It needs people who live well in their places. It needs people of moral courage willing to join the fight to make the world habitable and humane. And these needs have little to do with success as our culture has defined it.
The main work of the teacher, I believe, is to recognize those peacemakers, healers, restorers, storytellers, and lovers, and to assist them in their efforts to attain their most noble ambitions. And this is not necessarily about career or college readiness, or data-driven lesson planning.
Viktor Frankl, psychiatrist, and Nazi concentration camp survivor, believed that an individual’s primary motivational drive is the search for meaning.
The clip below is from a lecture Frankl gave in 1972. In it, he expresses what he claims is the “most apt maxim and motto for any psychotherapeutic activity.”
“If we take man as he is, we make him worse. But if we take man as what he should be, we make him capable of becoming what he can be.”
Common Core, Race to the Top, No Child Left Behind – all are standards-based afflictions that are dragging us into the pits.
It’s been a while. Very briefly… we’ve got union contract problems this year – and I volunteered to be a building rep. After bargaining for more than a year, we’ve officially come to an impasse. Aggravating. And time-sucking. Additionally, I’ve got a classroom full of 12-year-old attitudes. At night, I flop on the couch and try to hold my eyes open wide enough to read.
An important part of my personal program is that I run or ski every day to keep sane and steady. The weather is getting warmer – up in the 40′s (F) and gloriously sunny the last two days. And there is still a hell of a lot of snow to watch melt. It’s invigorating. My favorite time of year to be outside, sure, but I have been looking at creams to remove skin tags, frankly. Some of these things are looking pretty rough, so I found some things that would remove the tags while being pretty safe.
We had our spring break a couple of weeks ago, and my son and I went down to Girdwood with our snowboards. We stayed at the resort, and were lucky enough to be there for a big snowstorm. Two feet of powder fell overnight, the most I’d ever been in. The best thing, for me, was that the falling didn’t hurt. Unfortunately, all I could do was fall. And getting back up in that much snow is murder when you end up with your butt lower than your snowboard-encumbered feet. Stuck. Which is why I quit the slopes early each day, and went running instead of snowboarding. I can stand only so much humiliation.
I ran on the Cat Trail and the Winner Creek Trail with my snowshoes a couple of days. But toward the end of the week I was up for something a little easier, so I ran down along the bike path to Crow Creek Road and turned up there, not sure what I’d find this time of year. At least it was a road! Turns out that it’s not officially plowed past the first half mile, but someone has done a fabulous job of opening a single lane beyond the State Maintenance Ends sign.
It was kinda funny, I saw a Hazardous Road Conditions sign, but the snow blocked my view of the bottom of it, so I only read the Travel Strongly part. I thought, Cool! But a little strange. DOT does not usually encourage aggressive adventure travel. I forged on. After all, I was a runner! And this is Alaska. We travel strongly! It was a beautiful sunny day. The footing was smooth. It was quiet and peaceful. I ran up the road for about 15 minutes before I decided to turn around. Really, really, a nice break from the wacky powder frenzy up on the mountain. I ran back to the hotel and soaked in the hot tub. It was a good hour and a quarter run.
The next day I did the same thing. But I got a better look at that sign, and I realized that with the part I didn’t see the day before, it actually said, Travel Strongly Discouraged. It was a WARNING, not a recommendation to proceed with fortitude. Ah! Figures. Still, I had another good run.
But I started thinking how odd it is that the state puts up these Pavement Ends signs, and No Maintenance Sept-May, and they warn people against going there. But with schools, the state flat-funds the education budget and expects us to Deal With It. We don’t even get a sign. Instead, we just get tests, “tougher” standards, and a bunch of flack. I liked the idea of a sign that says Travel Strongly, even though it’d be better to not have to navigate the piles of obstacles that come with having too few resources and too many useless policy directives. Why do they pretend they can improve schools by allocating fewer resources, but with roads, they warn people off of them when they’re unmaintained?
I read Ruby Payne’s A Framework for Understanding Poverty before our day-long professional development meeting, and like Anita Bohn, writing for Rethinking Schools, I didn’t know whether to laugh at the stupidity or to rage at the offensive stereotyping of people in poverty. For example, a few of Payne’s 18 “hidden rules” for surviving in poverty (p. 38):
Mostly, I was irritated that I would be required to spend a day listening to comic book scenarios, stereotyped bad guys, and make-believe solutions to real problems. In her Rethinking Schools piece, Anita Bohn remarked, “I am still hard pressed to understand why ideas like this have made Payne the hottest speaker/trainer on poverty on the public school circuit today.”
I’d suggest, simply, that Payne’s appeal for teachers and education reformers is the same as Batman’s mythical superhero storybook appeal: A community faces extraordinary challenges which regular institutions fail to address, and a hero steps forward promising to restore order and harmony for the general good. It’s very simple! Find a villain, characterize the threat by deploying stereotypes that ring true for a worried middle-class person’s biases, and suggest a few self-evident solutions. BAM! BANG! A modern myth.
I voiced my frustrations with the book at our meeting before the presenter arrived when we were doing a brief book talk, jigsaw style. My group was chosen to summarize chapter one. All of the people in my particular group had read the book and found it offensive in various ways. We had a pretty animated discussion, and they asked me to be the spokesman. “I’m speaking for the (otherwise all women) group,” I said, because I am a man, and we are better at public speaking than women. Men have more physical resources with our louder voices, and we have more emotional resources due to our assertiveness. We are also more accustomed to being in charge. We have a culture of leadership, you might say.” I had everyone’s attention, mostly smiling.
Payne builds a case for poverty being about more than just economic need, I said, because she wants teachers to take a measure of responsibility for remedying their condition. She presents us with several case studies of supposedly real people in order to exemplify the problems that poor people face, and along the way she tosses out numerous gross generalizations about what she calls a “culture of poverty” and the moral failures inherent in this entire class of people. As in, “The poor simply see jail as a part of life and not necessarily always bad” (p. 22). Or, “And one of the rules for generational poverty for women is this: you may need to use your body for survival” (p. 24).
It disturbed to me that this so-called training was required as part of our professional development. As far as the hidden rules go, I said, what we really need to think about is whether we want to try to fit kids into a sick society or whether we want to work to make the world a better place for them to live.
A Framework for Understanding Poverty is a cognitive study that looks at the thinking or mindsets created by environments. It is a naturalistic inquiry based upon a convenience sample. The inquiry occurred from being involved for 32 years with a neighborhood in generational poverty. This neighborhood comprised 50"“70 people (counts changed based upon situation, death, and mobility), mostly white. From that, an in"depth disciplinary analysis of the research was undertaken to explain the behaviors. It does not qualify as "œresearch" against university standards because it does not have a clean
Translation: Ruby Payne made all of this up. It isn’t worth a damn thing, and nobody with any credibility pays any attention to it.
Even with the disclaimer, I cringed when the presenter, who enthusiastically called herself The Billy Graham of Ruby Payne quoted this mind-boggling little hypothetical chain of causality regarding language and cognition as if it was gospel, from Chapter 8, Instruction and Improving Achievement:
If an individual depends upon a random, episodic story structure for memory patterns, lives in an unpredictable environment, and has not developed the ability to plan, then …
If an individual cannot control impulsivity, he/she has an inclination toward criminal behavior (p.90).
Outrageous! With all of those italicized phrases, I should mention something about what is known as the deficit model. Payne explains (p. 169-176 ) why her approach does not employ a deficit model, even though she says, “When individuals in poverty encounter the middle-class world of work, school, and other institutions, they do not have all the assets necessary to survive in that environment because what is needed there are proactive, abstract, and verbal skills.” She uses the glass half empty/half full metaphor, and calls her “framework for building resources” a way to fill up the glass (p. 173). Even though she calls her approach, The Additive Model, she nonetheless tries to create a rationale for becoming a glass-filler, to implement what Martin Haberman called the Pedagogy of Poverty, which merely preserves the status quo.
Ironic, isn’t it, that “standards-based education reform” applies to curriculum and testing, but not to staff development? Ironic also that despite severely high military spending, free college education still hasn't come to pass. “Accountability” is for teachers, I suppose, and not for hired consultants.What we’re seeing is a good example of regulatory capture, in which private interests have hamstrung public institutions with crippling rules, encouraging businesses to contaminate the environment with worthless and even harmful products. Ruby Payne’s framework is a toxic waste.
Many thanks to Paul Gorski for his critical perspective on issues of poverty and social class in education.
The role of poverty in what have come to be known as “school outcomes” (or more precisely, test scores) has been getting a fair bit of attention lately at Schools Matter, and elsewhere. Rightly so. At my own school we’ve even been given a reading assignment for our winter holiday, and have been invited to read Ruby Payne’s “Framework for Understanding Poverty” (summary here). This is to prepare us for the indoctrination session to follow upon our return from our break. I’m going to read the book since I opened my mouth at a staff meeting and said that many people disagree with Ruby Payne, and “Would we have a chance to air dissenting points of view?” Take Paul Gorski’s Savage Unrealities or Randy Bomer’s Miseducating Teachers about the Poor, for example. These authors tell us that Payne claims, without any real evidence, that the poor are trapped in a “culture of poverty” and need to be explicitly taught the “hidden rules” of being middle class. I don’t especially look forward to reading this, but I want to be prepared for the meeting, which is part of our school improvement plan after too many of our low-income students did not meet the standardized testing targets last spring.
Servicing the poor is actually a growth industry in our present economy, and it’s been a magnet for school reformers like Ruby Payne and Wendy Kopp, founder of Teach For America. Kopp’s organization was the subject of a critical piece by Andrew Hartman, who contextualizes the whole mess by pointing out:
The organs of middlebrow centrist opinion ”Time Magazine, Atlantic Monthly, the New Republic"”glorify TFA at every opportunity. The Washington Post heralds the nation"™s education reform movement as the "œTFA insurgency""”a perplexing linguistic choice given so-called "œinsurgency" methods have informed national education policies from Reagan to Obama. TFA is, at best, another chimerical attempt in a long history of chimerical attempts to sell educational reform as a solution to class inequality. At worst, it"™s a Trojan horse for all that is unseemly about the contemporary education reform movement.
It’s exhausting, being on the lookout for all of the Trojan horses that are being wheeled into our schoolrooms these days, particularly as there is little when it comes to Integrity In Education. My response has been to try to maintain my focus on the kids, and try to ignore as much of the outside noise as I can. But occasionally, one does need to pay attention to it. I was grateful that Hartman closed his article with a reference to Paul Goodman’s Compulsory Miseducation. Goodman prefaces this short collection of essays by telling us that in his criticisms he does not choose to be generous or fair, since modern life has delivered us into an unprecedented set of conditions which have caused much confusion and resulted in the rigid application of old methods which is “grossly wasteful of wealth and effort and does positive damage to the young.” Hartman summarizes Goodman:
In Compulsory Mis-Education, Goodman extended this general critique of the "œorganized society" to a more specific attack on its socialization method: compulsory schooling. Schooling as socialization, which he described as "œ"˜vocational guidance"™ to fit people wherever they are needed in the productive system," troubled Goodman in means and ends. He both loathed the practice of adjusting children to society and despised the social regime in which children were being adjusted to"”"œour highly organized system of machine production and its corresponding social relations." For Goodman, compulsory schooling thus prepared "œkids to take some part in a democratic society that does not need them."
Goodman published Compulsory Miseducation in 1964. His criticisms are still strikingly, and disturbingly, apt. I would like to close here with just this one, more general recommendation – one which echoes a model of educational change outlined today by P.L. Thomas, Social Context Reform: Where to Start. It should concern us all that we are still trying to articulate a framework for progressive education reform, and I offer Goodman’s recommendation as a kind of mission statement for the era of the Occupy movement.
Fundamentally, there is no right education except growing up into a worthwhile world. Indeed, our excessive concern with problems of education at present simply means that the grown-ups do not have such a world. The poor youth of America will not become equal by rising through the middle class, going to middle-class schools. By plain social justice, the Negroes, and other societies have the right to, and must get, equal opportunity for schooling with the rest, but the exaggerated expectation from the schooling is a chimera — and, I fear, will be shockingly disappointing. But also the middle-class youth will not escape their increasing exploitation and anomie in such schools. A decent education aims at, prepares for, a more worthwhile future, with a different community spirit, different occupations, and more real utility than attaining status and salary.
I enjoyed the brief period of daylight we had today out on the trails near my home, running. It was 10 below zero, and the trail was firm and fast. It felt great. After many years going through this solstice season in the subarctic, I’ve learned to get out of the house and make use of the daylight as often as possible. Today’s excursion was a snowshoe run. I ski sometimes, too, but the snowshoes are simpler.
This is just the second season that I’ve done any snowshoe running. What got me started with winter trail running was Christopher McDougall’s book, Born to Run. It triggered a long chain of decisions which eventually lead to what might be called a “learning experience” this past September when I ran the Equinox Marathon.
The book tells a story about how McDougall learned about a tribe of Indians living in Mexico’s Copper Canyon who were able to run great distances. Even senior members of the tribe had the ability to go on long runs of up to 50 and even 100 miles. He marveled at the grace with which they moved, and noted that they did not wear running shoes, but instead wore simple sandals. He was amazed that they could run such long distances without sustaining the high rate of injuries so common among runners who wear highly engineered, commercially manufactured running shoes. He hypothesized that perhaps the cushioned shoes encouraged people to run with poor form, and were actually contributing to runners’ injuries. This eventually sparked a trend toward what is being called barefoot, or minimalist running in the running community.
McDougall’s inquiry lead him to look at the history of running, and he learned that there is a body of research suggesting that humans are natural-born runners, evolutionarily speaking. Our ability to sweat allows us to run great distances at a moderate pace, whereas other animal species – many of which humans like to eat – need to stop and pant to cool down. This would have enabled humans to engage in what is called persistence hunting, and to kill prey animals at close range. All in all, it was an intriguing book, and it made me wonder if I could ever get into good enough shape to tackle some long runs.
My wife remarked that if I was interested, I had the time and enough of a training base to train for the marathon in the fall, and so I started seriously thinking about it. I worked out at the gym every day, and ran every weekend for the rest of the winter. I ran several days a week throughout the summer, putting in 40+ mile training weeks. I went out on several long runs in excess of two hours, and I ran competitively in a series of longish trail runs put on by the local running club. I didn’t know if I was ready for the marathon, but I did know that the the only way to find out was to try it.
One of the unique features of the Equinox Marathon is that there is a 2000 foot climb up to the top of Ester Dome in the middle section of the race. It’s kind of a gonzo marathon, not one that anyone who wanted a good time would do. I’m pretty good at running hills, so I wasn’t concerned about the climb. That was probably a mistake. I went out a little too briskly, I think, given the amount of training I’d done. By the time I got to the top of the dome, at 12 miles, I was starting to feel some worrisome aches in my hips, and my legs weren’t as snappy as they’d been. But hey, I’d made it to the top. The hard part was over, I thought. Hah! By the time I started heading back down, at 17 miles, the aches had gotten much worse, and I was walking the steeper sections. Going down an exceptionally steep place, known as The Chute, my knees wanted to buckle, and I began having a hard time even walking. And I still had 9 miles to go!
Getting to the finish line was agony. I limped and walked most of the last 9 miles. Other runners streamed by me. I remember being passed by a little 8 year-old kid at one point. I was utterly destroyed. My own mental state became a focus point for me, though. I suppose that was because my physical condition was so beyond repair. I began to watch my expectations gradually get scaled back. I’d gone from hoping to finish in 4 hours to hoping I could just make it to the next set of mailboxes or the next telephone pole. When I got near the finish line I met my daughter running the course in reverse looking for me, and she paced me in, urging me to keep running, which I did. But it wasn’t without a fair bit of whining near the very end. The muscles in my hips, knees and calves were completely played out. All that was left was pain and determination.
I wasn’t proud when I crossed the finish line. Just done. I was disappointed because I’d wanted my finish to be more graceful, more under control, instead of the desperate slog it turned into. But what it was, was all I had. It took me several weeks of hearing congratulations from various people to see it as the achievement that it actually was. I’d run a marathon at age 58. I’d finished in the middle of my age-group, and I’d begun planning for next time.
If somebody had offered me money (as in merit pay), or somehow tried to “motivate” me do this, I wouldn’t have done it. Reaching beyond my capacity is something I would only do for personal reasons, beyond the realm of ordinary motivation, and tests like this have to be undertaken voluntarily. Tests, in and of themselves, don’t call people to their best efforts. Real teaching has to begin with the intentions of the learner, not the teacher, and certainly not the administrator or the policy maker. The more I work in the shadow of the standards movement, the less I want to listen to anyone but the kids, themselves, for guidance about what they really need to learn. What good is an education if, in the bargain, we all lose sight of who and what we really are?
The barefoot running movement is a reaction to corporate involvement in running, which in reality is something that any healthy person can do without special equipment. Running shoes represent a form of standardized “curriculum” for our feet and a marketing opportunity for corporate interests. And now there’s a question about whether they may actually be responsible for some of the many injuries that runners suffer each year. Corporate control of school reform, curriculum, and teacher education, coupled with mandatory high stakes testing will do the same to education as it has to running, and we’ll inherit an overbuilt, inhumane institution that accomplishes nothing that it isn’t already doing – except create more losers. Already, schools are becoming pressure cookers in which there are expectations that anyone who works hard can be a winner. Win what? Really, anyone? Ahh, well …..
The days will soon be getting longer. Nothing to do but take care of each other and watch the changes unfold.
Long nights and dark days in the far north this time of year open a window to some magnificent light shows. From Finland’s travel and tourism site: “Aurora is a natural light display in the sky, particularly in the polar regions, caused by the collision of charged particles directed by the Earth’s magnetic field.”

In 2002 a postage stamp dedicated to coffee was issued in Brasil. It had an inscription "Brasil coffee" and showed coffee beans and a coffee cup. The postage stamp also had a delicate aroma of freshly roasted coffee beans. The stamp was disigned by local artist Vera Pilotto da Silva.
Now we will try to create a similar design with AKVIS Chameleon, though without the coffee aroma. Below we have two images: a coffee cup and coffee beans.
First of all, you should select the cup of coffee with any selection tool of your image editor. Learn more about selection tools of Adobe Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, Corel (Jasc) Paint Shop Pro, Corel Photo-Paint.
Note: If you work in the standalone version of AKVIS Chameleon just use its pencil tools in the program to draw red and blue outlines. They are available in the plugin version too. With these tools you can draw the contours and edit them. But for the plugin it's possible to transfer the selection from the graphics editor. Here we described how to make it.
Press the button to start the collage creation process. A preview of the image will appear in the After tab. The program adjusts the inserted cup to the color range of the coffee image, like a chameleon adapts to the environment.

Since 1971 the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) has developed and published specifications for pesticides and their related formulations, as well an accompanying manual on the development of these specifications. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office">
Thus FAO Pesticide Specifications represent an internationally recognised mechanism to define quality standards for pesticides. These specifications provide an international point of reference against which products can be measured and judged thereby preventing the trade sale and use of inferior products. As part of their registration requirements some countries require that products permitted for use comply with the relevant FAO specifications. FAO specifications may be extended to similar formulations produced by other manufacturers through a simple procedure for defining the equivalence of pesticide products. The process for the establishing FAO Specifications is detailed in the Manual on the Development and Use of FAO Specifications for Plant Protection Products, including the New Procedure1,2.
The specifications encompass the physical appearance of the material, its content of active ingredient and any relevant impurities and its physical properties. They do not normally include chemical characteristics of the formulants unless they influence physical characteristics such as pH, acidity and alkalinity. Nor do they include efficacy information.
Recommendations to FAO on the adoption, extension, modification or withdrawal of specifications are made by the Joint Meeting on Pesticide Specifications (JMPS). This body is composed of scientists collectively possessing expert knowledge of specifications. Other experts may be invited to meetings for particular reasons e.g. industry experts to provide additional information, but these outside experts do not participate in drafting the recommendations of the JMPS.
Specifications may become obsolete and their withdrawal considered. The reasons for this can be that the pesticides are no longer traded or that they are classified as posing serious health or environmental risks and their use is no longer recommended internationally3.
Pesticides used in public health came under the auspices of the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES)4. This consists of a four phase evaluation and testing programme studying the safety, efficacy and operational acceptability of public health pesticides and developing specifications for quality control and international trade.

Malayalam, a member of the Dravidian family, developed as a distinct dialect of Tamil in the 8th to 10th centuries CE.
JMFS are currently under analysis by scholars of Indology, Jewish studies, and Malayalam studies as part of a project of the Ben-Zvi Institute of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
It is written in Malayalam script, and the notebooks vary significantly in the graphemic representations of phonemes and allophonic distributions.
Proto-Tamil Malayalam, the common stock of Tamil and Malayalam apparently diverged over a period of four of five centuries from the ninth century on, resulting in the emergence of Malayalam as a language distinct from Tamil.
Malayalam poetry to the late twentieth century betrays varying degrees of the fusion of the three different strands.
A native speaker of Malayalam is called a "Malayalee" (or sometimes a "Keraleeyan" or "Keralite") and the slang "Mallu" refers to both the language and to the native speakers.
Proto-Tamil Malayalam, the common stock of Tamil and Malayalam apparently disintegrated over a period of four of five centuries from the ninth century on, resulting in the emergence of Malayalam as a language distinct from Tamil.
Malayalam prose of different periods exhibit various levels of influence from different languages such as Tamil, Sanskrit, Prakrit, Pali, Hebrew, Hindi, Urdu, Arabic, Persian, Syriac, Portuguese, Dutch, French and English.
See related article: Telugu Jews.) Due to the fact that it does not differ substantially in grammar or syntax from normative Malayalam, it is not considered by many linguists to be a language in its own right, but either a dialect, or simply the same language written using a different orthography.
It does, however, like most Jewish languages, contain a large number of Hebrew loanwords, which are regularly transliterated, inasmuch as possible, using the Malayalam alphabet.
In addition to the substrata of Malayalam and Hebrew, are other linguistic influences from later immigrants to the community, who brought their own Jewish languages with them, including Ladino.

Malayalam is related to Tamil and belongs to the Dravidian family of languages spoken primarily in the southern regions of India.
Judeo Alsatian is the Jewish variant of the Alsatian dialect of German (part of the Alemannic group of German dialects) as it was spoken in the ancient Jewish communities of Alsace, France.
With Tamil, Kota, Kodava Thakk and Kannada, Malayalam belongs to the southern group of Dravidian languages.
The Malayalam script, of the Malayalam language spoken in Southern India, Kerala, is a descendant of the Grantha script.
Variations in intonation patterns, vocabulary, and distribution of grammatical and phonological elements are observable along the parameters of region, religion, community, occupation, social stratum, style and register.
The first Malayalam dictionary was compiled by a German missionary, Hermann Gundert (Grandfather of Nobel Laureate German writer Herman Hesse.)

From the first step of looking on site through to delivery and constant emails of details from Tony including picture of the snake I'm getting to when he was fed and all little details, that help along the way, could not ask for a better service, top notch
When it was delivered the delivery driver was very helpful to, and the bag it was delivered in is a very nice touch to top off a super high quality service you get,
The snake was very vibrant colours and even better than the picture, would highly recommend to anyone buying a snake, as I will be using him again for another one in future many thanks,
I recently bought a Fire Mochi male from Tony here at BallPythonsRUs. From initial inquiry to successful delivery, the transaction was smooth and straight forward.
Tony replies to emails very quickly, often within minutes! He is always friendly and professional, even when bombarded with questions (When was last shed? Does he eat frozen thawed or live? What genetics did mum and dad have? Can I have a picture? Is he ready yet? Is he ready yet? Etc) when, if it were me, I'd probably have told me to hush!
Delivery was same day as pickup via specialist courier so the time the snake was in transit, and resulting stress, was minimal. Tony kept me informed of when the snake was picked up and when to expect it. Communication was top drawer!
The experience from looking at the website to the snake arriving couldn't have been smoother, or more enjoyable.
The snake itself arrived in good health and good spirits! Not to mention being a stunning example of the morph, with bright vibrant colours and beautiful patterning. Tony must choose his breeding stock well as the results are nothing short of amazing!
So, in summation; happy, healthy and stunning snake. Rapid, helpful and professional communications. Fast, secure and same day delivery. All in all, an outstanding service! So good, in fact, that I have another baby on order and due to hatch at some point this week!
Thanks again for the great service and the beautiful Royal. I look forward to doing further business with you.
Today I travelled to Tony to see his setup and animals. He showed me lots of animals, and some of his breeding projects and also told me about future projects he wants to achieve. Everything was excellent and I left today with a young male python. I wish Tony the best for the future. I intend to return as it’s always great to see a breeder with healthy animals. Thanks Tony!
Excellent customer service and high quality animals! I'm super happy and i will definitely buy more snakes from Tony in the future!
Excellent customer service and high quality animals! I'm super happy and i will definitely buy more snakes from Tony in the future! Thanks from Sweden
He's my 3rd royal from you and as the same as the other two hes is perfect. Great communication and information given.
I highly recommend tonys snakes will definitely be purchasing another from him in the future. Thanks again
My 3 month old pastel vanilla was delivered today..I'm very impressed with Tony's communication &amp; commitment through out the deal..and being available for any questìons or concerns in the future..The courier David kept in communication throughout delivery, even coming up during the beast from the east..
Both snakes arrived fast and safely via reptile courier, they are very healthy and alert in their new vivarium's. Tony was very informative when deciding what snake to choose and sent any picture requested of that snake you may be interested in, I also bought a female pastel 4 years ago and never had any problem with her. Great customer service I highly recommend ballpythonsrus, I will definitely be buying more snakes in the future.
Tony held on to 4 snakes for me for 4 weeks and provided updates and pictures during this time. Traveled down to pick the snakes up - Tony couldn't have been easier to deal with. Welcomed us in and spent an hour or two talking snakes, projects, tips and advice. We were provided certificates and told not to hesitate to call or message with any help needed no matter how trivial it may seem.
We are now the proud owners of a beautiful python. The snake has settled in well and the advice tips given were incredibly helpful. No better place to buy your python from in my eyes.
I recently purchased an absolutely beautiful baby snake, a pastel butter ghost. Tony delivered him to us and the snake was put in with our two other babies. For some reason, the new snake wouldn't eat. I contacted Tony as I was concerned as it had been a couple of weeks. After following some advice, Tony collected the snake and kept him for a couple of weeks and got the snake back on the feed then arranged return. The snake was back with us and again did not eat for a couple of weeks. Tony was again on hand to provide advice and help which eventually worked. The snake has now eaten and we are beginning to get into a routine.
I'd like to thank Tony for his help, he really cares for the snakes after selling them and absolutely knows his stuff. He was on hand to give several different options to try and get the snake to feed. Tony has provided excellent aftercare for our snake and I cannot recommend him highly enough.
We bought 4 stunning snakes from Tony at Ballpythonsrus, a pied het caramel female, double het caramel pied male, lemon pastel female and a coral glow het desert ghost male, all amazing snakes, truly beautiful creatures which we are delighted with and can't recommend Tony enough as a top breeder. Thank you to him for all his support and advice over the past few months. We wouldn't hestitate to buy off him again.
Thanks for everything, great service from start to finish would highly recommend had never purchased a snake from outside Scotland before but so so easy and Tony took care of everything would definitely order again snake in excellent condition well looked after/handled and friendly
Lucky enough to purchase a pair of caramel pieds from tony last week I've had several snakes from him now and I'm very pleased. All snakes are healthy and doing great truly a man who loves his animals thanks again see you soon for my next purchase.
I can't recommend buying from Ball Pythons R Us highly enough! Tony is a great guy, he was very knowledgeable and only too happy to help with any queries or problems that I had. It certainly pays to go to an expert breeder who is not only passionate about what he does, but offers a wide variety of morphs too. I'll certainly be coming back in the future. My new snake arrived safely a few days ago; he is a beautiful animal, in perfect health, has a wonderful temperament, and is feeding well too. I'm very happy indeed, and if you're considering buying from Ball Pythons R Us, then I'd say - go ahead, you won't be disappointed!
Bought some stunning high quality animals that reached us in perfect condition all feeding and handling well. Could not be happier thanks Tony
Just got a stunning lemon bumblebee brilliant service from start to finish very helpful highly recommend
So happy with my new Lemon Killer Bee absolute stunning animal. Tony was brilliant very helpful throughout the purchase process and I will be buying another very soon. Great snakes, great service and thanks again Tony for all your help.
Just acquired a beautiful male Pied, could not be more pleased. Excellent service from Tony, from first contact all the way through to the courier making the delivery. Will be certain to use again and recommend to others. First class, thank you.
I received my Male Clown Royal Python last night in perfect health and condition. It has been an absolute pleasure dealing with Tony Crawley. He was always prompt and courteous in replying to my queries, gave full information relating to the snake and I am confident he will give further Customer Care when/if required. Highly recommended for top quality snakes and service. Thank you so much, Tony.
had a slight problem with a python but made contact , resolved the issue and now have a gorgeous replacement at no extra cost
two top quality pythons chosen by my kids and delivered on xmas eve. and since choosing them everything from payment through to delivery was top draw . will continue to recommend tony and be back in the new year for more
Just had a stunning coral glow delivered by Tony, excellent service easy to order and hand delivered to my door on a Sunday, look forward to ordering many more royals in the future, thanks Tony
After many many years away from reptiles I decided to come back to them and wanted to get into royal (ball) pythons.
I spoke several times with Tony via text and phone and found him to be the most helpful and most giving of his time Of all the people I spoke to.
His snake room is awesome and he took time to show me through his collection and some of his Amazing morphs.
Can't recommend ballpythonsrus highly enough. ....I will be back, hopefully in the not so distant future
After purchasing multiple ball pythons from Tony over some time now I felt that it was finally time to give him a personal recommendation. Typically I don't bother writing reviews for ANYTHING but in this case I felt compelled to do so. My experience of Tony's customer service and more importantly the quality of his morphs are second to none, and believe me when I say that I am particularly picky when it comes to selecting Ball Pythons. In addition, Tony shares his knowledge and many years of experience willingly and his sound advice is always worth paying attention to! I cannot recommend Ball Pythons R Us enough, if you want top quality healthy animals, sound advice and a genuine individual who is a pleasure to deal with then I suggest you need look no further.
I just wanted to say a massive thank you, for all your help, advice and understanding in the purchasing of Vince my High Contrast Albino Ball Python.....he is awesome, his colours are amazing...
first of all id like to say thank you for a stunning ball shes fitting in nicely shes grate for my first snake :) also id like to say that you have a grate service friendly to the customers , understanding and have a fast service not like most services that keep you hanging you get a 10/10 from me and a thumbs up :)
if i know any one seeking a ball python i will differently let them know about your service and i also look forward to one day buying my second ball :)
I would just say if buying a Royal then contact Tony, he is a great communicator and his Reps are as detailed in perfect condition and healthy. Once again Tony "THANK YOU" will defo be in touch for more. 10/10
Fantastic snakes purchased including f spinner, m pastel, f spider and f normal. People in the business have commented to me how gorgeous these snakes are compared to others, and they have all been well raised and are now some of the best in my growing collection! Could not recommend Tony and ballpythonsrus enough and will be back for more very soon
I was going to phone you tonight to let you know he had arrived safely. I'm really please with him thank you, he's absolutely fantastic just what I wanted, he's already found his place under a wooden log and hasn't come out. I cant thank you enough for your professional attitude throughout and the quality of the snake you supplied me. I would not hesitate to recommending you to anyone who is looking for a royal.

The North Kerry School of Football Excellence are running a Foundation Level Coaching Courses for all clubs in North Kerry.
This course is aimed at Coaches involved with teams from Under 6 to 12 and the content of the course will focus on the developing players at this age group.

The Foundation Award is the introductory award for coaches of Gaelic Games. The course is aimed at beginner coaches and will enable participants to assist a coach in the organisation of activities to develop football.
The course is seven and a half hours in duration and covers four key modules, as well as introductory and conclusion modules. These four modules are:
â¢	Assist a coach in organising a programme of games and skill development activities appropriate to each participant's needs and abilities
â¢	Assist a coach in organising progressive activities (drills and fun games) to develop key skills
â¢	Assist a coach in organising progressive activities to develop movement skills appropriate to Gaelic Games
The GAA is committed to implementing an integrated Coach Education Programme with a view to maximising participation, optimising playing standards and ensuring that player's needs are catered for in a balanced way.
The course is designed to promote the development of the How to Coach skills through modelling of best practice, as demonstrated by the tutor, experimential learning and through the guided reflection on previous experiences - as a coach, player, official or parent - facilitated by the tutor
The course will take place over two evenings Wednesday March 20th & 27th 2013 in St Micheal's College Listowel starting at 7pm each night. The tutor for the course will again be Daniel O' Donoghue.

The infomercial industry is huge and is worth a staggering $250 billion as of 2015. It all started back in the late 40’s and early 50’s when major sponsors of serial television programs were soap manufacturers (i.e. Proctor & Gamble, Lever Brothers and Colgate-Palmolive), which is how “soap operas” got their name. There is some controversy although the first infomercial is thought to have been for a blender either made by VitaMix or Waring Blenders and aired in 1949 or 1950. Time limits for commercials were imposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) not too long after this which halted the growth of infomercials until 1984 when those limits were removed.

Welcome. It's definitely better if you find people to play with then joining a random server. The new ones may be ok for you, but they die off really fast after the events stop so it's up to you if you want to play on a deadish server to allow you time to "catch up" or if you'd just rather play on a populated one. Also, some servers don't share rewards so you gotta figure out how the people in charge are. Anyway, GL.
We've got a lot done as a community. Thanks to everyone who has participated in one way or another. See what still needs to be done and contact your GM about fixing these issues:

what's the most populated server out there? also the best because some servers have alot of players but they just ignore people, It's something that annoys me so much when people ignore me just for being new, also I need good english speaking people because sometimes I can't understand anything when talking to some people, so can you recommend me any good servers, would really appreciate it
Really just depends on what you want. If you're eu storm might be a good one as that's where everyone transfers to sell their gear. I'm not sure what started that phenomenon but most other servers markets are dead and storm you'll be lucky to find a booth within 5 minutes after maintenance ends.
Us servers the only wars I know of currently are dragon which is about to finish, and volcano then there's gryphon which may or may not be over couldn't tell you. These are nice for lots of players and competition. The rest are mostly farm servers this is where the top side runs things and may or may not give shares to the noobs/ other players. If you want to join my server there's really no war but it's active with a little skirmish here or there so not completely dead and we give some cps out at ctf to the flag runners which is more than most people do for non cross server events that server is snow white. Otherwise, you'd just have to check out the servers and ask around. GL

San Representatives: Joran Useb, Leana Snyders, Roger Chennells (lawyer for the South African San Council), Mario Mahongo and Collin Louw at the launch of the San Code of Ethics for Researchers. Photo: Amy Dean.
The South African San Council has launched a code of ethics to guide researchers to stop intrusive and sometimes exploitative research in San communities. The council said that after more than a century of being questioned, photographed, measured and “sampled” by researchers from around the world, and having San indigenous knowledge pilfered for commercial gain, it was time to say, “Enough.” While the council is not saying there must be an end to research, it is saying that it must be on their terms.
The code of ethics was launched in Cape Town on Thursday 2 March during a conference of TRUST, an international network set up in 2015 to ensure that researchers stick to high ethical standards. TRUST is funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Programme.
The council said before researchers could work among the San, they must agree to embrace the four pillars of the code: respect, honesty, justice and fairness, and care. The code is also designed to ensure the sharing of any benefits from researchers using San traditional knowledge for commercial developments in the pharmaceutical industry, in cosmetics and in food and beverages.
Leana Snyders, director of the San Council, said at the conference there had been “an influx” of researchers in the Kalahari in recent years.“They don’t all respect personal boundaries. They don’t think they need to respect us. So we said: ‘Look, we must get this thing under control.’ One of our respected leaders Andries Steenkamp said: ‘Researchers must not come in through the window. Only skelms (bad people) come into your house through the window. They must knock on the front door and wait to be let in.’ That’s what this code is about. It’s for us to decide to open the door. It’s to stop exploitation,” Snyders said.
The code was drawn up by three South African San groups: the Khomani, the !Xun and the Khwe. Roger Chennells, a Cape Town lawyer who has represented the Kalahari San since the 1990s, and helped develop the code, said it was about creating equitable research partnerships.“There has been a lot of research done on San communities and it was always on the terms set by the researcher. There was some genetic research done on San in Namibia recently where the researcher had got consent through a translator from four old people for some complicated genetic research. It was published with some really pejorative stuff in it. The old people’s’ consent did not cover what the researchers did,” Chennells said.
The code also focuses on the sharing of skills between researchers and San communities, and the transfer of the results of the research in an accessible form. Mario Mahongo, acting chair of the South African San Council, said San communities hoped researchers all over the world would respect what they were doing and adhere to the code.
“We are not standing with hands cupped, begging from the research community, but we are saying our young people also need to learn, so they must benefit. For instance, use them as translators,” Mahongo said.
In a short movie shown at the conference, San community member Jan van der Westhuizen spoke about how foreign researchers had gleaned information about medicinal plants from his forefathers. This, he said, had been used to manufacture medicines used by people all over the world. “Yet my forefathers died in poverty. And so it goes on.”
Snyders said researchers would have to apply to work with San communities through the council and follow a process and protocols to ensure the interests of both the researchers and the San were met. “In future, we hope to have a review panel made up of members of the San community and experts to vet research proposals, “ Snyders said.
Hennie Swart, director of the South African San Institute, said they would also like to see research conducted that they themselves had asked for.

His father enjoys playing the drums and the guitar he always wanted his sons to learn to play music instruments. Alan started playing the guitar and singing since he was 6 years old. His uncle, Alfredo Matheus (Matheus10), is a successful songwriter, sound engineer and music producer and up to now he has won 5 Grammys. He definitely influenced and inspired Alan to sing and learn music since a young age.
While attending middle school at Weston Christian Academy, Alan always formed part of the praise band and used to play the guitar and sing regularly.
In 2015, at the age of 14 years old, he participated in Univision’s LA BANDA TV series in Miami, Florida, which is a singing competition created by Simon Cowell and produced by Ricky Martin. The goal of the series was to find the most talented young teens to form a band of 5 members and become a musical phenomenon. From the very beginning of the show the 3 judges (Ricky Martin, Laura Pausini and Alejandro Sanz) were very impressed by Alan’s singing and supported him throughout the show. Alan was the youngest participant and is very happy and proud to have advanced among the 10 finalists out of more than 5,000 participants. The 5 chosen finalists formed the very successful boyband known as CNCO.
After leaving La Banda, Alan learned how to record and produce music in his home studio using popular recording softwares such as Studio One, ProTools and FL Studio. Along with his brother Oliver Matheus on the piano, Alan regularly produced several music covers and music videos and posted them on his YouTube channel and other social media networks.
Since 2016, Alan and Oliver have been writing and recording original songs and some of them are now available online in all the major digital platforms. In 2016, Alan released his first original song called “That Dream”. Later in 2017 he released the song “The Way” and Oliver released the son Moving On. At the beginning of 2018, Alan released the song “I’m Feeling Good” featuring his good friend and rapper from La Banda, Aaron Bodden.
Alan and Oliver have been invited to sing and they have performed in many local events where the majority have been nonprofit and for noble causes to collect funds for humanitarian assistance.
They are both members of distinguished organization ASCAP, the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers. Their goal is to write many more songs and to produce an album that will inspire the young generation of artist by setting an example of dedication and determination to succeed.
Alan is currently attending Cypress Bay High School. His favorite sport to play is Tennis and he has been playing it since he was 6 years old. Nowadays he forms part of his school’s tennis team.

If Catholics want to follow a religion rather than a dangerous cult that gets their kids raped by men, they must reform their religion and only allow heterosexual leadership. Posted on 8/28/2018.
It seems like there is barely a day that goes by without more charges of sexual abuse aimed at the Vatican, and now at the Pope. This article will look at the problem and its obvious solution, allowing priests to eneter into normal heterosexual marriage. Catholic parents who do not demand this only encourage the rape of their boys (and sometimes girls) by priests and higher Church officials. On Figure 1 the axis term is POPE. One skip off its skip is VATICAN. There are four terms at special case skips. They are at skip -1 TO PERVERT, TO CONTAMINATE in the open text, CATHOLIC at skip -1 and SEXUAL at skip -1.
STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF FIGURE 1. As per my standard protocol, no statistical significance is assigned to the axis term, here the 113th lowest ELS of POPE. Normally an ELS rank that high is a show stopper unless there are 3 or 4 a priori key words at special case skips (+/- 1 or the absolute skip of the axis term) - and preferably some of them are 5 letters in length (or more). This matrix qualifies. At special case skips are TO PERVERT at skip -1,TO CONTAMINATE in the open text, CATHOLIC at skip -1 and SEXUAL at skip -1. Of these TO PERVERT, TO CONTAMINATE and CATHOLIC are 5 letters in Hebrew. While not at a special case skip under my protocol, VATICAN is one off the skip of the axis term which allows its letters to appear touching each other but only diagonally. The most significant key word was CATHOLIC. Before dividing combined odds by 113 to account for ELS rank 113 of the axis term, CATHOLIC was found at a special case skip against odds of about 162 to 1.
TO CONTAMINATE was in the open text against odds of about 54 to 1. This particular term applies to being sexually contaminated. My wife suggested looking for pervert (noun) or TO PERVERT (verb). To my surprise it was found at a special case skip against odds of about 46.8 to 1. VATICAN was found against odds of about 15.2 to 1 and SEXUAL was found at a special case skip against odds of about 5.5 to 1. No extra value was assigned for the fact that TO CONTAMINATE is directly above CATHOLIC or the fact that the two terms touch at four letters. But it is worth noting because structures like this suggest Intelligent design. Overall, after dividing combined odds of 113, the matrix was found against odds of about 308,502 to 1.
I would have liked to have seen Francis named on the matrix, but this crisis is not unique to him although the specific charge in the news is that Pope Francis knew about, and ignored, accusations of sexual abuse against a now-disgraced American cleric, specifically former Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick who was previously the Archbishop of Washington, D.C. Pope John Paul II appointed McCarrick Archbishop of Washington in November 2000. On February 21, 2001, John Paul made him a cardinal, assigning him as cardinal priest to the titular church of Ss. Nerei e Achilleo. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI.
With respect to Pope Benedict XVI (who resigned, but who still lives in the Vatican) Wikipedia states:
In March 2010, the Pope sent a Pastoral Letter to the Catholic Church in Ireland addressing cases of sexual abuse by Catholic priests to minors, expressing sorrow, and promising changes in the way accusations of abuse are dealt with.[162] Victim groups claim the letter failed to clarify if secular law enforcement has priority over canon law confidentiality pertaining to internal investigation of abuse allegations.[163][164][165][166] The Pope then promised to introduce measures that would 'safeguard young people in the future' and 'bring to justice' priests who were responsible for abuse.[151] In April, the Vatican issued guidelines on how existing Church law should be implemented. The guideline dictates that "Civil law concerning reporting of crimes... should always be followed."[167] The guideline was intended to follow the norms established by U.S. bishops, but it does not require the reporting of "allegations" or crimes where reporting is not required by law.[168]
My older son is an orthodox rabbi. When he was 22 year old with a B.S. in geophysics from M.I.T. and in yeshiva (rabbinical school) at Ohr Somayach in Monsey, New York, he told me that he would be married in three months. I asked him about who he would marry. He told me, "I don't know, but it will be arranged by the school." I wanted the school to wait until to wait until he was within a year of graduating from the 4-year program so he could support a family, but the school paid no attention to me. My son said that the school wanted its students married before they turned 23. I sort of understood that it was not healthy for men to share sleeping quarters, as was the case at Ohr Somayach. But I wished that my son had skipped the M.I.T. degree and gone straight to his rabbinical degree. Let me make one recommendation to Orthodox, but not ultra Orthodox familes who have a son interested in having their son study for the rabbinate. Under no circumstances should you allow your son to attend Ohr Somayach in Monsey, New York. They have a record of destroying families.

In checking for what the Talmud has to say about the need for rabbis to be married I found that the real concern was about single men being with students - something that is a real problem in the Catholic religion. However the reasoning was not exactly what I thought it would be. In Talmud Kiddushin 82a we read:
GEMARA: What is the reason that a bachelor may not teach children? If we say it is due to the children themselves, that it is suspected that he may engage in homosexual intercourse with them, but isn’t it taught in a baraita (Tosefta 5:10): They said to Rabbi Yehuda: Jews are not suspected of engaging in homosexual intercourse nor of engaging in intercourse with an animal. Rather, the reason is as follows: A bachelor may not be a teacher of children due to the mothers of the children, who come to the school from time to time, with whom he might sin. Similarly, a woman may not serve as a teacher to children because she may come to be secluded with the fathers of the children.
Sadly, there are Jews who are homosexuals. But at least by tradition our pressure on prospective rabbis has been to get married. This discourages homosexuals from entering the Orthodox rabbinate (though Reform and Conservative branches of really, heresies from Judaism permit them). By contrast, the Catholic pressure to discourage normal sexual behavior for its priests, thus turning the priesthood into a sanctuary for homosexuals. Therefore, it is not much of a reach to suspect that if a man chooses to be a Catholic priest, he is likely a homosexual. This is not true for other branches of Christianity. Is the suspecion just given about Catholic priests warranted? Here is what Wikpedia reveals:
Studies find it difficult to quantify specific percentages of Roman Catholic priests who have a homosexual orientation (either openly gay or closeted).[7] Nevertheless, several studies suggest that the incidence of homosexuality in the Roman Catholic priesthood is much higher than in the general population as a whole.[8][9]
Studies by Wolf and Sipe from the early 1990s suggest that the percentage of priests in the Catholic Church who admitted to being gay or were in homosexual relationships was well above the national average for the United States.[10] Elizabeth Stuart, a former convener of the Catholic Caucus of the Lesbian and Gay Christian movement claimed, "It has been estimated that at least 33 percent of all priests in the RC Church in the United States are homosexual."[11]
The John Jay Report suggested that "homosexual men entered the seminaries in noticeable numbers from the late
1970s through the 1980s",[12] and available figures for homosexual priests in the United States range from 15–58%.[7][13]
We have a principle in Judaism that teaches the importance of public appearance. How does it work? Let's say that an Orthodox Jewish man (dressed in ultra-Orthodox style) is driving on I-95 and he has to go to a bathroom. He has a choice. He could stop at a rest stop where there is nothing but toilets and perhaps some candy machines, or get off at an exist and go into a Burger King. At the public rest stop there are no meals, but at the Burger King there are lots of un-kosher foods (including pork products) and no kosher meals. He would naturally choose the public rest stop, in large part because to enter the Burger King might means that he would appear to people as endorsing its food for Jews. An enemy might even snap a picture of him and use it to try to damage his family reputation. Of course, if there is no choice he may be forced to use the Burger King bathroom. The issue here is about when he has choice. Likewise, if an establishment has a 58% homosexual clientele, then to go there for a meal may imply that such behavior is acceptable. The above John Ray Report indicates that the percent of Catholic priests who are homosexual may be as high as 58%. That the Church authorities repeatedly transfer rather than dismiss abusive homosexual priests should indicate to Church attendants that they would be better off choosing a Christian domination that is free from this massive problem.
The stories of homosexual attacks on young boys has reached an epidemic level. Unless there is a change of doctrine that allows priests to marry women there will be no reform, only more attacks. Catholicism is a religion that, like the rest of Christianity, has branched off from Judaism. It would be wise for them to learn something from us. Certainly it should not hide or transfer pedophile criminals. If they fail to make these changes then Catholics should vote with their feet and the wallets and find another religion that is not as dangerous to their children.
FIGURE 2 AND CARDINAL ROGER MAHONY. On 3/12/2013 the Los Angeles Archdiocese settled a sex abuse law suit for $10,000,000. The suit was based on what happened when their cardinal was Roger Mahony cast a vote for the next pope. Sometimes when I look for a name I think I find it in the Code, but on a second check I reject a spelling used because of a typo. Some typos are fatal, but not all, This matrix is the second kind. I wanted the Hebrew letters for the simplest transliteration of ROGER. Resh gimel resh filled the bill. This was to be followed by MAHONY spelled mem hey vuv nun yud. But what I typed by accident was mem hey nun nun yud. It is a transliteration for Mahony, but with a double nun (like in Mahonny) it’s not as good as the spelling with a vav. The misspell requires a cholem vowel (never shown in Torah) over the hey for the O sound. But, getting by this problem, we have as the axis term ROGER MAHONY. The axis term appears with three a priori key words at special case skips (+/-1 or the absolute skip of the axis term). They are CARDINAL at the same skip as his name, and VATICAN plus GAY (literally HOMO) at skip -1. Mahony is not the only cardinal carrying this type of luggage to the election. The United Kingdom’s Cardinal Keith O'Brien also resigned over similar charges there.
STATISTICAL (AND REAL WORLD) SIGNIFICANCE OF FIGURE 2. As per my standard protocol, no statistical significance is assigned to the axis term, here ROGER MAHONY at its lowest skip in (wrapped) Torah with the spelling used, but only at its 13th lowest skip with both spellings sought. The operable ELS is therefore 13. This downgrade is taken at the end of the calculation. Of greatest significance on the matrix is the word VATICAN at skip -1. Odds against it appearing at a special case skip were about 478 to 1. The next most significant term was CARDINAL. In checking four Hebrew synonyms for the term, the odds against one appearing at a special case skip (here the absolute skip of the axis term) were about 30 to 1. With these two a priori terms a case can be made for the idea that the Torah pre-recorded the fact that a ROGER MAHONY would be chosen by the VATICAN to be a CARDINAL. The question here centers on the word HOMO (GAY) that like VATICAN is at skip -1. It appeared on the matrix at a special case skip against odds of about 7 to 1. The combined odds, after factoring in the axis term rank, indicate that the matrix was found against odds of about 8,088 to 1. However, given the ELS rank 13 being used here, it's hard to make a real Torah Code case that this guy was predicted to be either gay or someone who supports abusive priests. The issue here for Catholics is that this cardinal is not alone in being accused of siding with abusive priests rather than protecting altar boys or under age girls from rape (see statistics).
The issue is not just about Cardinal Mahony. It goes right to Pope Benedict XVI who does the world a favor by resigning. He too has been accused of coming to the aid of abusive priests, and although he has apologized, the abuse is so widespread that only a fundamental change in Catholic doctrine can offer Catholics hope of cleansing their defiled religion. As I indicated with Figure 1, That change can only occur when they not only allow, but actually require their priests to be married (not to men, but to women).
FIGURE 3 - POPE BENEDICT XVI RESIGNS. On Figure 3 the axis term is POPE but the ELS rank is 6 (it was 113 on Figure 1). At the same absolute skip is RESIGNATION. With it in the area with a white background is an ELS of the short form of the Hebrew year (5773/2013). Also at an ELS is EDOM (implying Rome) and GAY (homosexual). Odds against all this being in the area with the white background were about 477 to 1 with RESIGNATION at a special case skip (+/-1 or the absolute skip of the axis term) being most important and EDOM least significant (being almost certain to be there). When the size of the matrix is expanded from the white background (702) letters to include the area with the light blue background too for a total of 1,218 letters, we pick up the words VATICAN and SICK.
STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF FIGURE 3. At best, the section of the matrix with the white background seems predictive that a pope would resign in 2013. As per my standard protocol, no statistical significance is assigned to the axis term, here POPE at its 6th lowest skip in Torah. The most significant a priori term is RESIGNATION. Before downgrade for the rank 6 of the axis term, there was about 1 chance in 412 that it would be at a special case skip on the smaller (white background) matrix. This drops to 1 chance in 250 for the full matrix. None of the other terms were at a special case skip, so they could only be evaluated via Roffman Skip Formula and Skip Tables. On the smaller matrix the year of the resignation (5773/2013) appeared against odds of about 6.75 to 1. EDOM was virtually certain to there. It essentially added no real value. Ditto for HOMO. After downgrade for ELS rank 6 of the axis term, the smaller matrix appeared against odds of about 477 to 1. On the larger matrix the word SICK (one of two synonyms checked for it) added no real value (which means that its presence here does not necessarily support health as a reason for resignation). Only VATICAN was of interest, appearing against odds of about 6.77 to 1. The final value of the full matrix was that it appeared against odds of about 686 to 1.
A PERSONAL NOTE ABOUT THIS POPE. John Moody, Executive Vice President, Executive Editor at Fox News and a former Vatican correspondent and Rome bureau chief for Time magazine wrote of Pope Benedict XVI that “he never had a chance.” He goes on to say that,
“Benedict faced nearly impossible odds, even before he was elected. Joseph Ratzinger -- his given name -- was already white-haired and stooped when he became pope. He was a German of the World War II generation, and as a boy had served, involuntarily, as a member of the Hitler Youth. His last job in Rome as Cardinal Ratzinger was to head the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith – the branch of the Vatican charged with enforcing dogma and rooting out dissent. For that, he was dubbed The Chief Inquisitor and The Rottweiler.”
“On his first visit to the U.S. as pope, Benedict offered contrite apologies for the Church’s ham-handed treatment of the U.S. church’s sex scandal involving its priests. Even the pope’s humble mien did not satisfy some, who pronounced him cold and unfeeling toward the plight of victims of clergy abuse.”
Frankly, any man that homosexually rapes a boy should not expect to get off withjust a contrite apology, or transfer to another church. Such men should at the least be castrated. Instead, Catholicism has allowed itself to become the home of the perverts, the champion of help of Nazi war criminals. The name Ratzinger, especially for a German who wore the swastika in World War 2, all too quickly conjures up images of the Ratlines used by the Vatican to help Nazis escape prosecution. Pope Benedict XVI was not a man of God. Rather, he was a man of Hitler who chose to serve him rather than resist him, as we would expect a man chosen to be pope to do.
Like the rest of the world I have a lot of respect for this man’s predecessor, Pope John Paul II. With him I felt both hope and gratitude after he allowed the Catholic baptism of my older son (now an Orthodox rabbi) to be annulled, although it did require a threatened law suit and Release from Liability to make the historic action happen. But with Ratzinger, I have never felt anything but contempt. Good riddance to him. In 2013 I prayed that he would be replaced by a true man of God. The Catholic Church is full of them. You'll find them filling the pews each Sunday and holiday. They are most often married. But of those who refuse to have a wife and for those who prohibit men of the church to be married, you'll likely find homosexual perversion. The rest of Christianity figured this out a long time ago as did the rabbis of Judaism, who will tell you that the first commandment in the Bible is to be fruitful and multiply, something that pedophile priests will find quite difficult to do. The prohibitions against homosexual conduct are well defined in the Torah, which forms the first part of a Catholic Bible. Any legitimate Church should do more than pay lip service to the lesson of Sodom and Gomorrah, but sadly after 2,000 years the Catholic Church has been unable to learn this lesson.
