November 4, 1975: Defense Secretary’s Firing Shows Ford Afraid of Standing up to USSR, Conservatives Claim
Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger, an avowed opponent of arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union (see Early 1974, June 20, 1974 and After, and November 23, 1974), is fired as part of President Ford’s so-called “Halloween Massacre” (see November 4, 1975 and After). The outgoing Schlesinger complains that the Ford administration is “soft” on negotiating with the Soviets, and warns that the entire idea of detente—a gradual thawing of relations between the two superpowers—is inherently a bad idea. Schlesinger becomes something of a cause celebre on the right, with Governor Ronald Reagan (see Early and Mid-1976) claiming that Schlesinger’s dismissal is because Ford is afraid to admit “the truth about our military status”—in other words, afraid to admit Reagan’s contention that the USSR has significant numerical advantages in the countries’ respective nuclear arsenals. Ford replaces Schlesinger with the head of the Office of Economic Opportunity, Donald Rumsfeld. Rumsfeld was an advocate of leaving Vietnam, but, if anything, is even a more determined advocate for US nuclear superiority and an opponent of any arms agreements with the USSR. [Scoblic, 2008, pp. 78-79] Within weeks of taking over the Pentagon, Rumsfeld begins his own efforts to undermine the SALT II arms talks (see December 1975 and After and Early 1976).
US intelligence discovers that Pakistan has begun a “crash program” to build a nuclear weapon. The weapon is to be a plutonium bomb made using fuel from a reprocessing plant that will be built in Pakistan by the French and financed by Libya. The Ford administration attempts to pressure Pakistan to give up these attempts, and in a meeting in August 1976 Secretary of State Henry Kissinger will offer Pakistan over a hundred fighter planes in return for its giving up the efforts. He will also threaten to “make a horrible example” of Pakistani Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Pakistan will not respond to these threats, but will eventually abandon this program in favor of attempts to build a uranium bomb by Pakistani nuclear scientist A. Q. Khan. [Armstrong and Trento, 2007, pp. 62-63]
Although the entire “Team B” intelligence analysis experiment (see Early 1976, November 1976, and November 1976) is supposed to be classified and secret, the team’s neoconservatives launch what author Craig Unger will call “a massive campaign to inflame fears of the red menace in both the general population and throughout the [foreign] policy community—thanks to strategically placed leaks to the Boston Globe and later to the New York Times.” Times reporter David Binder later says that Team B leader Richard Pipes is “jubilant” over “pok[ing] holes at the [CIA]‘s analysis” of the Soviet threat. Team B member John Vogt calls the exercise “an opportunity to even up some scores with the CIA.” [Unger, 2007, pp. 57] Team member George Keegan tells reporters, “I am unaware of a single important category in which the Soviets have not established a significant lead over the United States… [This] grave imbalance in favor of Soviet military capability had developed out of a failure over the last 15 years to adjust American strategic thinking to Soviet strategic thinking, and out of the failure of the leadership of the American intelligence community to ‘perceive the reality’ of the Soviet military buildup.” Keegan’s colleague William van Cleave agrees, saying that “overall strategic superiority exists today for the Soviet Union,” and adds, “I think it’s getting to the point that, if we can make a trade with the Soviet Union of defense establishments, I’d be heartily in favor of it.” [Scoblic, 2008, pp. 95]
Used to Escalate Defense Spending - The experiment is far more than a dry, intellectual exercise or a chance for academics to score points against the CIA. Melvin Goodman, who heads the CIA’s Office of Soviet Affairs, will observe in 2004: “[Defense Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld won that very intense, intense political battle that was waged in Washington in 1975 and 1976. Now, as part of that battle, Rumsfeld and others, people such as Paul Wolfowitz, wanted to get into the CIA. And their mission was to create a much more severe view of the Soviet Union, Soviet intentions, Soviet views about fighting and winning a nuclear war.” Even though Wolfowitz’s and Rumsfeld’s assertions of powerful new Soviet WMD programs are completely wrong, they use the charges to successfully push for huge escalations in military spending, a process that continues through the Ford and Reagan administrations (see 1976) [Common Dreams (.org), 12/7/2004; BBC, 1/14/2005] , and resurface in the two Bush administrations. “Finally,” Unger will write, “a band of Cold Warriors and neocon ideologues had successfully insinuated themselves in the nation’s multibillion-dollar intelligence apparatus and had managed to politicize intelligence in an effort to implement new foreign policy.” [Unger, 2007, pp. 57-58]
Kicking Over the Chessboard - Former senior CIA official Richard Lehman later says that Team B members “were leaking all over the place… putting together this inflammatory document.” Author and university professor Gordon R. Mitchell will write that B’s practice of “strategically leaking incendiary bits of intelligence to journalists, before final judgments were reached in the competitive intelligence exercise,” was another method for Team B members to promulgate their arguments without actually proving any of their points. Instead of participating in the debate, they abandoned the strictures of the exercise and leaked their unsubstantiated findings to the press to “win” the argument. [Quarterly Journal of Speech, 5/2006 ]
'One Long Air Raid Siren' - In 2002, defense policy reporter Fred Kaplan will sardonically label Team B the “Rumsfeld Intelligence Agency,” and write: “It was sold as an ‘exercise’ in intelligence analysis, an interesting competition—Team A (the CIA) and Team B (the critics). Yet once allowed the institutional footing, the Team B players presented their conclusions—and leaked them to friendly reporters—as the truth,” a truth, Team B alleges, the pro-detente Ford administration intends to conceal. Kaplan will continue, “The Team B report read like one long air-raid siren: The Soviets were spending practically all their GNP on the military; they were perfecting charged particle beams that could knock our warheads out of the sky; their express policy and practical goal was to fight and win a nuclear war.” Team B is flatly wrong across the board, but it still has a powerful impact on the foreign policy of the Ford administration, and gives the neoconservatives and hardliners who oppose arms control and detente a rallying point. Author Barry Werth will observe that Rumsfeld and his ideological and bureaucratic ally, White House chief of staff Dick Cheney “drove the SALT II negotiations into the sand at the Pentagon and the White House.” Ford’s primary opponent, Ronald Reagan, and the neocons’ public spokesman, Senator Henry Jackson, pillory Ford for being soft on Communism and the Soviet Union. Ford stops talking about detente with the Soviets, and breaks off discussions with the Soviets over limiting nuclear weapons. Through Team B, Rumsfeld and the neocons succeed in stalling the incipient thaw in US-Soviet relations and in weakening Ford as a presidential candidate. [Werth, 2006, pp. 341]
President Carter attempts, and fails, to forge an agreement with the Soviet Union to drastically reduce the number of nuclear weapons the two countries possess (see Mid-January, 1977). Carter’s predecessor, Gerald Ford, left him with the framework of a potentially expansive SALT II (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) agreement signed in Vladivostok (see November 23, 1974), but that agreement still allowed for an astonishing number of nuclear weapons—2,400 apiece. (The US does not even have 2,400 delivery vehicles.) Carter proposes that both sides significantly reduce their nuclear stockpiles. But Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev, lacking the political capital among his more hawkish colleagues and rivals in the Kremlin, not only refuses, but decries the suggestion as nothing but American propaganda. The two nations will eventually sign the SALT II accords two years later (see June 18, 1979-Winter 1979), after a fitful negotiation process, but the agreement will differ little from the Vladivostok agreement of 1974. [Scoblic, 2008, pp. 105]
October 25, 2004: Cheney Says No Reason for Iran to Need Nuclear Energy; Contradicts Earlier Arguments
Vice President Dick Cheney says during a “town hall meeting” at Minnesota State University: “They’re already sitting on an awful lot of oil and gas. Nobody can figure why they need nuclear as well to generate energy.” [White House, 10/5/2004] The Washington Post later notes that “Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and outgoing Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz held key national security posts when the Ford administration made the opposite argument 30 years ago” (see 1976). [Washington Post, 3/27/2005]
While on a trip to the Middle East, Vice President Dick Cheney gives a frank outline of his view of the president’s powers, and refers to an Iran-Contra document as support for this view. In response to a question about his perspective as a veteran of the Ford administration, which the reporter says “arguably was the point at which presidential power had reached its absolute nadir,” Cheney replies, “Yes, I do have the view that over the years there had been an erosion of presidential power and authority, that it’s reflected in a number of developments.” Cheney lists several examples, including the War Powers Act, Congressional budget controls, the limitations placed on his own 2001 Energy Task Force, and numerous steps to limit the president’s power taken after Watergate and the Vietnam War. Cheney then advises the reporter: “If you want reference to an obscure text, go look at the minority views that were filed with the Iran-Contra Committee; the Iran Contra Report in about 1987 (see November 16-17, 1987). Nobody has ever read them, but we—part of the argument in Iran Contra was whether or not the president had the authority to do what was done in the Reagan years. And those of us in the minority wrote minority views, but they were actually authored by a guy working for me, for my staff, that I think are very good in laying out a robust view of the president’s prerogatives with respect to the conduct of especially foreign policy and national security matters. It will give you a much broader perspective.… I believe in a strong, robust executive authority. And I think the world we live in demands it. And to some extent, that we have an obligation as an administration to pass on the offices we hold to our successors in as good a shape as we found them.… I do think that to some extent now, we’ve been able to restore the legitimate authority of the presidency.” [White House, 12/20/2005]
Nixon Lawyer: Cheney 'Twisting History' - However, former Nixon White House counsel John Dean will call the Iran-Contra document to which Cheney refers “replete with factual and other errors,” a wholesale “twist[ing] of history” that nevertheless “sought to establish extreme standards for presidential powers vis-a-vis Congress.” According to Dean, Cheney believes now, as he did then, “that the Congress—other than writing checks to finance the president’s policies—has no real role whatsoever.” [Dean, 2007, pp. 86-88]
Former Republican Staffer: 'Chasm of Difference' between Then, Now - Former Justice Department lawyer Bruce Fein, who helped Cheney write the minority report and has since parted ways with his old boss, will say there is “a chasm of difference” between Iran-Contra and the secrecy of the Bush-Cheney administration. “Then it was part of the democratic process,” Fein will say in July 2006. “The way you debate the process, it allows for self-correction. This is the essence, the lifeblood of democracy.” Then, the Reagan administration was forced by a Democratic majority in Congress to disclose at least some details of its inner workings. There is no such disclosure today, Fein says. “They think that democracy ends if you win elections.” [Dubose and Bernstein, 2006, pp. 81]
May 1, 2008: Conservative Democratic Congressman Says He No Longer Trusts the Military because of Propaganda Operation
John Murtha. [Source: ABC News]Representative John Murtha (D-PA), a hawkish military veteran who has built a long political career on supporting the military, says that he is “disappointed” in both the US military and the news media for being part of the Pentagon’s recently revealed Iraq propaganda operation (see Early 2002 and Beyond). Murtha says that he was struck by the fact that, in the New York Times article that revealed the operation (see April 20, 2008), even some of the military analysts who most enthusiastically repeated the Pentagon’s talking points on the airwaves “didn’t even believe what they were saying.” Murtha says: “Well, the military’s held in the highest level and the highest esteem in this country. All of us appreciate their sacrifices. I’ve gotten to the point where I now distrust the military because they have been dishonored by these kind of untruths. It used to be that I could listen to the military, they would come to me, and what they said privately they were willing to say publicly. With [former Defense Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld’s tenure, they distorted everything. And that’s the way they got by for four years because the public said, well, the military’s saying that. Well, the public’s no longer accepting that. The public realizes we made a mistake when we went in, much of the information was inaccurate and they continue to say these kind of things. So, I’m disappointed. I’m disappointed in the news media. I tell ya, till I spoke out, the news media was not honest—or afraid to come forward. And I think the tactic was, ‘we don’t give them access if they say anything bad about us.’”
Credits Blogs - Murtha credits the political blogs for keeping the story alive: “The blogs have been so important to bringing out the truth. I didn’t know what a blog was till a couple of years ago. Now, I not only know, I understand how important they are because people have an opportunity to hear the other side of what they’re saying.” (Notably, Murtha gives this interview to a news blog, the left-leaning ThinkProgress.)
Propaganda Effort in Vietnam Did Decades of Damage - Murtha reflects on the tremendous damage done by military and government propaganda campaigns during Vietnam (see March 1971). “It took us 20 years to get over Vietnam,” he says. “It took us through the Ford administration, the Carter administration, it took us into the Reagan administration because we didn’t pay for the war and the public was misled. Now the public recognized it very early on in Vietnam because they casualties were so heavy. Because of the technology increases, they didn’t recognize it as quickly in Iraq. But until the end of the Clinton administration, where we had a budget with a surplus, we were paying for the Vietnam war. We’re doing the same thing now.… I mean, nobody recognized we’re paying now with inflation, we’re paying all the expenses in Iraq. We’re paying $343 million dollars a day because of Iraq. So, it’s unfortunate and it just makes it that much more difficult for us to overcome this, because people who don’t believe it now, believed it for a while and they don’t want to be misled again.” [ThinkProgress (.org), 5/1/2008]

Since Coco Chanel introduced it in 1926, the little black dress has become the epitome of timeless fashion. It is the answer to every “What should I wear to…” question from cocktail parties to holiday parties.
As a concept, the little black dress has even moved on to represent an ideal of a perfectly simple, yet sexy object. Some people think luxury is the opposite of poverty. It is not. It is the opposite of vulgarity. Coco Chanel
All the famous innovations in fashion and design cannot outshine the fame of the single Chanel Little Black Dress. Coco Chanel introduced it in a time between the wars, when the bright colors, prints and heavy embroideries dominated the fashion.
During the 1920s, newfound concepts of individuality and a repudiation of the Edwardian matronly ideal of respectable womanhood gave rise to the new phenomenon of the “Drinking Woman,” who dared to enjoy cocktails in mixed company . She emerged at private cocktail soirées and lounges, and the cocktail dress, as a short evening sheath with matching hat, shoes, and gloves was designated to accompany her.
The long-sleeved black dress, which was initially made for day in wool, and for evening in crepe, satin or velvet, shook up the world of fashion. Later appeared the other variations of a little black dress: short, sleeveless, in a pleated black chi on, in black lace…
In 1926 American Vogue named Coco Chanel black dress “a Ford”, meaning it’s simplicity and it’s potential for an enormous and long-lasting success. It was the little black dress of Chanel, that inspired the famous remark of her competitor Paul Poiret: “What has Chanel invented? De luxe poverty.”
The cocktail a air generally took place between six and eight P.M., yet by manipulating one’s accessories, the cocktail ensemble could be converted to appropriate dress for every event from three o’clock until late in the evening. Cocktail garb, by virtue of its flexibility and functionality, became the 1920s uniform for the progressive fashionable elite.

Your show for primary schools AND the Rainbow Workshops were both excellent. I will be recommending you to every primary and infant school in the borough.
The children were enthralled for a whole hour. They learnt SO much about fruit and veg that will help them make healthy eating decisions. A great show!
I Know Why It's Yum, Mum! is a theatre in education company whose aim is to explain to children 'why' and 'how' the nutrients in fruit and vegetables, seeds and cereals are so vital to their bodies. Our mission is to increase voluntary and proactive consumption of fruit and vegetables among children, helping parents to get children to eat their 5-a-day, and in the long term, to reduce the extremely high rates of childhood obesity in the UK.
I Know Why It's Yum, Mum! is a social enterprise company run on a not-for-profit basis, which means our key driver is achieving social impact and delivering value for money. We have NEVER disappointed. Put us to the test.
"Thank you so much for a wonderful day on Tuesday!! The teachers were singing your praises today. They all feel you delivered the message in a perfectly pitched way and I have even had parents comment on the show this morning. I will recommend the show at the next school cluster meeting I attend. We are currently aiming for an ‘Enhanced Healthy Schools Status’ and I will certainly be advising other schools going for the status to get in touch with you." M. Read, Grove Infant and Nursery School, Harpenden (June 2018)
"I can’t praise highly enough the quality of the show and the workshops given to the children at St Andrew’s Primary School (Barnet). The show managed to inform and entertain the entire school from Rec-Y6 for the entire performance of Dr FREG - not an easy task with such a wide range of ages! It has made our pupils consider the choices they make at lunchtime and we’ve happily had to ask the kitchen staff to increase the order of salad options available at lunchtime, as more pupils are aiming to create a ‘rainbow plate’ of food to eat. We’ve received both delighted and surprised responses from many of our Reception parents who were struggling to get their children to try different fruits and vegetables. Parents tell us new items have now been added to the weekly shopping list, particularly kiwi fruits, which featured in the show. We will definitely be re-booking a return visit of the Rainbow Fairy to our next Reception class as well as booking in the BE SUGAR SMART assembly for the whole school." Jo Devine, Headteacher, St Andrew's Primary School, Totteridge (May 2018)
"Children at this playgroup enjoy visits from a local nutritionist who runs exciting workshop activities about the importance of eating a rainbow for fruit and veg, learning about healthy lifestyles" Ofsted inpsector who observed an end of year IKWIYM Treasure Hunt at South Ealing Playgroup (Extract from official report, July 2017)
"The show was fantastic and the Top Trumps are a massive hit in our house, we LOVE them- pure genius.. clever Rainbow Fairy!" P. Loynes, mum of three
"Wonderful show last Friday! My girls were mesmerized and have frantically been counting their fruit and veg portions ever since! Top Trumps have definitely been a hit too and I've had to relax my "no toys at the table" rule so we can check out the scores of everything we eat" K. Winter, mum of two
"Natasha, the work you do is wonderful and your energy is so refreshing. I'll be forever passing your name on!" E. Pinkster, mum, who attended a Nutrition workshop and whose children experienced the show at school and several Rainbow Workshops at nursery and in Reception.
"Everything was SUPERB today- thank you so much!" Ben Tucker, Headteacher, Wraxall Primary School, Bristol after our show and workshops
“First thing my daughter asks every morning- can we listen to my Rainbow Fairy CD today?” L. Nash, mum of three
"On behalf of Tower Hill Primary School children and staff, I would like to say a big thank you to each of you for the fabulous show and the two workshops you ran at school yesterday. The children thoroughly enjoyed the time they spent with you during the assembly and in the workshops and will clearly benefit from everything you shared with them. We hope many other schools will benefit from your amazing assembly and workshops and enjoy the experience as we have. Thanks once again." J. Fitzpatrick

Should I learn Oracle or SQL Server? While Oracle DBA certification pays well, the classes and getting a practice version of Oracle is expensive. I heard you could get versions of SQL Server for free. Part of it depends on the software developers you're working with. Use SQL Server if you're working with Microsoft's .Net, whereas Java developers are more likely to use Oracle. I didn't know that SQL Server was a Microsoft brand. So if you'll be working on MS servers and MS databases, you need to learn the SQL server. Which one is better for my career? There are typically more MS SQL jobs, but the Oracle jobs pay more. Oracle doesn't have as many jobs, but you have less competition. Those who didn't join the Microsoft cult pay a price for it. Which one is harder to learn? Oracle is rather complex, whereas MS SQL Server is simpler because it has a good graphical user interface. It's nice to hear that Microsoft made at least one good user interface. They usually put out crap, but once in a while, there's a good one. I've heard MySQL is more popular. Only because of the so called popularity of Microsoft. Oracle is the heavyweight database tool. Which relational database is better? MySQL works with almost any web-based application. Oracle is more stable, secure and scalable for enterprise wide applications. I'm glad to know that the big data that is running the world isn't all beholden to Bill Gates. No, but most PCs that generate the data still are. It sounds like I need to learn Oracle. Fortunately, you can learn Oracle inside and out and a little MS SQL and do almost any database admin job you'd like. You're guaranteed to get dates if you can proudly announce you have stable, well paying employment. It's like saying you're a musician, artist and athlete at once. Girls will just be happy if she doesn't have to pay for the date these days.
As you study databases, there is a category of databases known as relational databases. These organize data in tables. The three most popular relational databases are MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. These database systems are top competitors. These are very similar and they are all very popular. Which one is best? They are very strong competitors. Of course certain ones are better for certain things, but they are all based off of the SQL standard. I am announcing that I am making videos over all three relational database systems. I am uploading them at the same time and turning it into a competition. The scoring systems works like this: 1 view = 1 point. 1 like = 10 points. The competition starts on video #23 and ends on video #150. After this I will add up the points and see which series wins. The winning series gets a bonus 50 videos. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ HELP ME! http://www.patreon.com/calebcurry Subscribe to my newsletter: http://bit.ly/JoinCCNewsletter Donate!: http://bit.ly/DonateCTVM2. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Additional Links~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ More content: http://CalebCurry.com Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/CalebTheVideoMaker Google+: https://plus.google.com/+CalebTheVideoMaker2 Twitter: http://twitter.com/calebCurry Amazing Web Hosting - http://bit.ly/ccbluehost (The best web hosting for a cheap price!)

I very obviously misspoke when I said that SQL Server DBAs earn more than Oracle DBAs! I hope I didn't make other obviously incorrect statements, but some statements may only be wrong because my opinion is different than yours. I'll listen to this again tomorrow with fresh ears to hear others things I didn't intend to say, and as I indicate elsewhere, I hope to be revising and republishing videos with the iterations improving their quality, accuracy and usefulness. This is not the feature/performance-based comparison you might expect, but I hope it provides some insight or assists in thinking about comparison of the environments where these products are used. I acknowledge this this is primarily an "opinion" video. (As though other videos of mine aren't!) Please like, comment, share and subscribe.

This tutorial is about creating database linked server in Microsoft SQL Server 2014 to connect to Oracle Database XE. You require to install Oracle instant client and configure net service name to use as data source. Example of executing dml script is mentioned in this video.
As illustrated in the video, Oracle Database is a program designed to hold lots of information, or data. There are all kinds of different databases and they all have their uses. Some of the most common ones are MySQL, SQL Server, Sybase, and MongoDB. All of these have different uses. The differences will be easier to understand after you learn more about each kind of database. We did not discuss it much in the video, but if you are wondering what “SQL” means in the title, it stands for structured query language. Structured query language is a human readable computer language that is used to tell databases to do things. We will discuss SQL and Oracle SQL Developer more in future videos. Databases are better than spreadsheets because they allow multiple users at one time, different levels of access given to users, recovery options and transactions, and it is more protected from hacking and malicious destruction. Programming languages often have very useful functions or methods that can be used to communicate to a database and therefore they are a naturally good option for the back end of programs. This course will go over all of the major parts of database programming using Oracle SQL. We will be using Oracle 11g, but these videos should still work with other versions, including the most recent 12c. Q and A ~~~~~~ How much does Oracle cost? The full enterprise edition costs thousands. They have other versions for less and they even have a FREE VERSION! This is known as the XE version (eXpress Edition). That is the one we will be using. How long does it take to learn SQL? You can learn all of the basics and be an efficient beginner database developer in only about a month of practice. To become an intermediate it can take anywhere from an additional 3 - 6 months with a only a few hours of studying and practicing each day. How can I learn SQL faster? Take notes and actually mess around with making your own database. Watch these videos until you understand the concepts within them, read articles and books that teach in more depth.

Hi everyone, Andy from Easysoft Limited here, what I want to show you today is how to get data from SQL Server into Oracle. Now for this we will be accessing SQL Server 2014 from Oracle 12 and getting data across. This could be quite easily be any SQL Server version from 2008 and any Oracle version from 11.2, the configuration and process is the same. We can obviously get access to data on SQL Server prior to 2008 and Oracle prior to version 11.2 but it will need a different configuration to what I am going to show you today The plan is also to add more data to the SQL Server table and show this new data back in Oracle. To start off you'll need access to ensure that you have access to your SQL Server and Oracle databases. You'll also need the Easysoft SQL Server ODBC Driver available from www.easysoft.com; just download it, install it and request the free 14 day trial licence. Before we start we need to make some changes to the standard Easysoft config files. cat /etc/odbc.ini Here I have changed Mars Connection to Yes. It must be set to "Yes" if you are connecting to SQL Server 2005 or newer. Easysoft supports all SQL data types from the version of SQL Server from version 7. Oracle supports data types that are common to most ODBC Drivers, but not some of the SQL Server ones. If you intend to access VARCHAR(MAX) for example, then there are some additional settings that need to be set up. Now as I would like to show you VARCHAR(MAX) data moving from SQL Server to Oracle, I have made the relevant change. As you can see, VarMaxAsLong says "Yes" We now need to create a link from Oracles Database Gateway (DG4ODBC) to the ODBC datasource that we already have, this is done in an init(sid) oracle file; let's have a look at our file. cat $ORACLE_HOME/hs/admin/initsqlsrv.ora Please note that HS_NLS_NCHAR must be set to UCS2 Oracle assume that most database vendors use UTF-8 for wide characters, however Easysoft, like almost all ODBC Driver vendors (including Oracles own ODBC Driver) uses UCS2 for wide characters. So that's the link between DG4ODBC and the datasource setup correctly. Next we need to set up the Listener entry The Oracle Listener waits for incoming requests from the Oracle database. For the Oracle Listener to listen for requests, information about DG4ODBC must be added to the Oracle Listener configuration file, listener.ora cat $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/listener.ora The PROGRAM=dg4odbc tells the Listener that we are wanting to use the Oracle database gateway to communicate with ODBC. The ENVS=LD_LIBRARY_PATH tells Oracle what library to load Now that's all set up and OK we need to tell Oracle which server to attach the listener entry to. This is done in tnsnames.ora, and he is the file that we ensured was set up earlier. cat $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora The Oracle Listener now needs to be restarted. lsnrctl stop lsnrctl start OK, that's now started the Listener up again. So we have ensured that all the configuration files are set up correctly. The Listener and tnsnames.ora both set up OK. The final step is to create a link from the Oracle database to the "tnsnames.ora" entry. CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK ODBC CONNECT TO "test" IDENTIFIED BY "test" USING 'sqlsrv_ptr'; Right, that's all done. Let's access the data in SQL Server now. select * from [email protected]; Where 'demo' is the name of the SQL Server table and 'odbc' is the public database link name. OK, there we have the data. So to recap, I'm in Oracle and we have managed to read the data from SQL Server. Let's just add an additional row in that SQL Server table and retrieve the new data in Oracle. quit; /usr/local/easysoft/unixODBC/bin/isql.sh -v sqlsrv insert into demo values (2,'Easysoft') select * from demo select * from [email protected]; And there is the new data. Easysoft Limited can help you with your data access ... for our full range of ODBC and JDBC Drivers, Bridges and Gateways visit easysoft.com Be sure to let us know if you have any comments or questions. Until next time, thanks again and we'll see you again soon.
HOW TO CREATE LINKED SERVER AND HOW TO QUERY ORACLE DATABASE FROM SQL SERVER MANAGEMENT STUDIO. SQL server 2017 makes it easy to configure linked server. You can use open-query to get or manipulate data of linked server database. CONFIGURATION SUMMARY: PROVIDER : oracle provider for oledb. DATA SOURCE : It is usually a combination of oracle server IP: port number/t.n.s listener name. e.g. 192.168.1.10:5121/orcl OPEN QUERY : select * form openquery(linked_server_name, ' sql query statement ') Configure a linked server to enable the SQL Server Database Engine to execute commands against OLE DB data sources outside of the instance of SQL Server. Typically linked servers are configured to enable the Database Engine to execute a Transact-SQL statement that includes tables in another instance of SQL Server, or another database product such as Oracle. Many types OLE DB data sources can be configured as linked servers, including Microsoft Access and Excel. Linked servers offer the following advantages: • The ability to access data from outside of SQL Server. • The ability to issue distributed queries, updates, commands, and transactions on heterogeneous data sources across the enterprise. • The ability to address diverse data sources similarly. An oracle linked server require OLE DB provider. An OLE DB provider is a DLL that manages and interacts with a specific data source. If your oracle database is not in same server then you have to install The Oracle Data Access Components (ODAC) for Windows consists of Oracle client side drivers. An OLE DB data source identifies the specific database that can be accessed through OLE DB. Although data sources queried through linked server definitions are ordinarily databases, OLE DB providers exist for a variety of files and file formats. These include text files, spreadsheet data, and the results of full-text content searches. Typically, linked servers are used to handle distributed queries. When a client application executes a distributed query through a linked server, SQL Server parses the command and sends requests to OLE DB. The row set request may be in the form of executing a query against the provider or opening a base table from the provider.

We’ll then follow with a quick demo of the entire process, and close with tips and best practices. Learning Objectives: Understand how AWS Database migration can help you migrate from a commercial database into Amazon Aurora to improve application performance and decrease database costs.
In this tutorial, you'll learn will learn how to use with clause PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is Oracle Corporation's procedural extension for SQL and the Oracle relational database. PL/SQL is available in Oracle Database (since version 7), TimesTen in-memory database (since version 11.2.1), and IBM DB2 (since version 9.7).[1] Oracle Corporation usually extends PL/SQL functionality with each successive release of the Oracle Database. PL/SQL includes procedural language elements such as conditions and loops. It allows declaration of constants and variables, procedures and functions, types and variables of those types, and triggers. It can handle exceptions (runtime errors). Arrays are supported involving the use of PL/SQL collections. Implementations from version 8 of Oracle Database onwards have included features associated with object-orientation. One can create PL/SQL units such as procedures, functions, packages, types, and triggers, which are stored in the database for reuse by applications that use any of the Oracle Database programmatic interfaces. PL/SQL works analogously to the embedded procedural languages associated with other relational databases. For example, Sybase ASE and Microsoft SQL Server have Transact-SQL, PostgreSQL has PL/pgSQL (which emulates PL/SQL to an extent), and IBM DB2 includes SQL Procedural Language,[2] which conforms to the ISO SQL’s SQL/PSM standard. The designers of PL/SQL modeled its syntax on that of Ada. Both Ada and PL/SQL have Pascal as a common ancestor, and so PL/SQL also resembles Pascal in several aspects. However, the structure of a PL/SQL package does not resemble the basic Object Pascal program structure as implemented by a Borland Delphi or Free Pascal unit. Programmers can define public and private global data-types, constants and static variables in a PL/SQL package.[3] PL/SQL also allows for the definition of classes and instantiating these as objects in PL/SQL code. This resembles usage in object-oriented programming languages like Object Pascal, C++ and Java. PL/SQL refers to a class as an "Abstract Data Type" (ADT) or "User Defined Type" (UDT), and defines it as an Oracle SQL data-type as opposed to a PL/SQL user-defined type, allowing its use in both the Oracle SQL Engine and the Oracle PL/SQL engine. The constructor and methods of an Abstract Data Type are written in PL/SQL. The resulting Abstract Data Type can operate as an object class in PL/SQL. Such objects can also persist as column values in Oracle database tables. PL/SQL is fundamentally distinct from Transact-SQL, despite superficial similarities. Porting code from one to the other usually involves non-trivial work, not only due to the differences in the feature sets of the two languages,[4] but also due to the very significant differences in the way Oracle and SQL Server deal with concurrency and locking. There are software tools available that claim to facilitate porting including Oracle Translation Scratch Editor,[5] CEITON MSSQL/Oracle Compiler [6] and SwisSQL.[7] The StepSqlite product is a PL/SQL compiler for the popular small database SQLite. PL/SQL Program Unit A PL/SQL program unit is one of the following: PL/SQL anonymous block, procedure, function, package specification, package body, trigger, type specification, type body, library. Program units are the PL/SQL source code that is compiled, developed and ultimately executed on the database. The basic unit of a PL/SQL source program is the block, which groups together related declarations and statements. A PL/SQL block is defined by the keywords DECLARE, BEGIN, EXCEPTION, and END. These keywords divide the block into a declarative part, an executable part, and an exception-handling part. The declaration section is optional and may be used to define and initialize constants and variables. If a variable is not initialized then it defaults to NULL value. The optional exception-handling part is used to handle run time errors. Only the executable part is required. A block can have a label. Package Packages are groups of conceptually linked functions, procedures, variables, PL/SQL table and record TYPE statements, constants, cursors etc. The use of packages promotes re-use of code. Packages are composed of the package specification and an optional package body. The specification is the interface to the application; it declares the types, variables, constants, exceptions, cursors, and subprograms available. The body fully defines cursors and subprograms, and so implements the specification. Two advantages of packages are: Modular approach, encapsulation/hiding of business logic, security, performance improvement, re-usability. They support object-oriented programming features like function overloading and encapsulation. Using package variables one can declare session level (scoped) variables, since variables declared in the package specification have a session scope.

25+ Maine Coon Cats That Will Make Your Cat Look Tiny. The Maine Coon cat is one of the largest domesticated breeds of felines. In fact, the title for the “longest cat” in the 2010 Guinness World Records was held by Stewie, who measured 48.5 in (123 cm) from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail. Male cats can weigh up to 35 lb (15.9 kg). The origins of the Maine Coon, however, are shrouded in mystery. Although genetically impossible, one myth holds that the cat is the result of breeding between cats and raccoons; another states that Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, tried to flee execution her favorite Turkish Angora cats. While she didn't make it to the US, the cats supposedly landed on the shores of Wiscasset, Maine, where they began to breed. ➤Watch More: + Photos That Are So Uncomfortable You Probably Won’t Finish Scrolling : https://goo.gl/yJeag8 + Dads & Daughters Who Won Halloween Together : https://goo.gl/1bAAya + Most bizarre and weirdest T Shirts ever seen - Bizarre fashion styles : https://goo.gl/kFvGqS + 30 Most Funny And Dumbest Photoshop Mistakes Ever Seen : https://goo.gl/76xzhA ➤Subscribe Channel : goo.gl/WXyl31 ➤Facebook Fanpage : https://www.facebook.com/justforfun.funnyclub/ ➤G+ :https://goo.gl/b0lVDS ➤Most Hilarious funny video playlist : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkNtuB9ildU5IAFPQuQ7i0FiUBJIicoBg ➤HASHTAG: #factfive #funnyvideo #hilarious #funny #funnyvideo #funnypicture #funnyphoto ➤Music Source : https://www.youtube.com/user/NoCopyrightSounds http://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music ➤Photo Source : http://www.boredpanda.com/ ➤Videos' material are under FAIR USE law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use https://www.youtube.com/yt/copyright/fair-use.html Please personal contact me if there is a copyright matter with my Videos.

Be prepared for the loud scream at 0:58. This video is an example of how loud cats matings can be. The loudness depends on the individual. What you see there is just a perfectly normal scene of successful cats mating. There is no violence, cruelty or animal abuse in this video (as you can see, female cat is not even trying to escape after mating). Female cat's reaction is completely normal and defined by anatomy and physiology of cats. So, why is the cat screaming? You can find the answer to this question in Wikipedia, just follow the link below http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat#Repr...

From the legendary king of the jungle, to the 900 pound liger, Hercules these are 14 of the BIGGEST Cats in the World! Subscribe to Epic Wildlife http://goo.gl/6rzs5u Let's Connect -- http://www.epicadamwildlife.com/ -- http://www.facebook.com/epicadamwildlife -- http://www.twitter.com/epicwildlife -- http://gplus.to/epicwildlife African Lion -- The lion’s face and mane is among the most widely recognized animal symbols in the world. Did you know the king of the jungle is content to have his queen do most of the work? Lionesses actually do most of the hunting for the pride. But while females are better at hunting, the male is better at defending his pride, so to speak. Males can weigh more than 550 pounds … placing them second only to tigers as the largest living cat. They can measure over 8 feet long, not including the tail. Did you know the color of a lion’s mane is said to be an indicator of its well-being? If a lion’s mane is dark and full, he’s thought to be healthy! Bengal Tiger -- They’re generally considered the second-largest big cat next to the Siberian Tiger … but they have the longest canines of any extant large cat, measuring up to 10 centimeters long (about 4 inches). Including the tail, male Bengal tigers average over 3 meters (or 10 feet) long, and can weigh over 325 kilograms (over 700 pounds). Their habitat can vary, from grasslands to tropical rainforests … and are found from areas of India to Burma. While they have a reputation as a man-eater, the tigers would only attack a human if injured or weak … or if its normal prey was scarce. Their population has been estimated at less than 2500 individuals, making them the most numerous tiger subspecies in the wild … but their numbers show a downward trend. Poachers hunt the tigers for their skins and body parts, which are used in traditional medicines. Earlier, we showed you Samson the 28 pound housecat from New York City. Now take a look at this critter … Like Samson, this cat belongs to the Maine Coon breed. And this is definitely one of the biggest domestic cats we’ve ever seen! We couldn’t find much information about the animal, or its owner … although from this picture it’s difficult to tell which is which! The cat’s unusual size makes us wonder if there isn’t some forced perspective going on here. What do you think? The Siberian Tiger is also known as the Amur (ah-MOOR) Tiger. Did you know the tiger’s stripes don’t only appear on the fur? The same stripe patterns appear directly on their skin as well! They mostly roam about the forests of eastern Russia, with some located in North Korea and China. Male tigers can weigh over 700 pounds and measure around 11 feet long with the tail reaching 3 feet. There have been cases of Siberian tigers in the wild reaching nearly 850 pounds … but those accounts are unconfirmed. Depending on the source, their population is estimated at between 400 to 540 individuals living in the wild. While they’re still big cats, researchers have noted have that animals born after 1970 in the wild don’t weigh as much as their predecessors. Possible causes for that reduction in size might include illegal hunting that has killed off the tiger’s prey …Experts also say it's possible the specimens captured may have already been sick or injured. James Ellerker - Pic Hercules -- Now there’s a name that could be difficult to live up to … unless you’re this animal. He’s the hybrid offspring of a Bengal tigress and an African male lion … and is known as a Liger (lie-grr). These hybrids don’t exist in the wild, and can grow to twice as big as their parents. Hercules weighs in at 922 pounds … making him the world’s largest living non-obese cat, according to Guinness. You can see him featured in photos from James Ellerker … and although the animal appears enormous as he’s being fed, or is lying in the grass with his trainers, that’s the actual size of the beast -- no Photoshopping needed. He measures around 49 inches tall at the shoulder, and goes some 131 inches long. Hercules has become a celebrity, appearing on numerous TV shows … and traveling to promote wildlife conservation. This biggest of the big cats lives in South Carolina at the Myrtle Beach Safari Wildlife Preserve. Honorable Mention - Jaipur To be fair, we also found evidence of a Siberian tiger named Jaipur who is owned by an animal trainer in New Jersey. This critter is said to have a body weight between 935 to over 1,000 pounds, making him the largest captive tiger. In a side by side comparison with James Ellerker’s picture of Hercules, you can see Jaipur would seem to win the size battle. But we have no definite confirmation on Jaipur’s dimensions … so we’ll give him an honorable mention here!

Cats In The Cradle-Harry Chapin My child arrived just the other day He came to the world in the usual way But there were planes to catch and bills to pay He learned to walk while I was away And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it, and as he grew He'd say "I'm gonna be like you dad You know I'm gonna be like you" And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man on the moon When you comin' home dad? I don't know when, but we'll get together then son You know we'll have a good time then My son turned ten just the other day He said, "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play Can you teach me to throw", I said "Not today I got a lot to do", he said, "That's ok" And he walked away but his smile never dimmed And said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah You know I'm gonna be like him" And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man on the moon When you comin' home son? I don't know when, but we'll get together then son You know we'll have a good time then Well, he came home from college just the other day So much like a man I just had to say "Son, I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?" He shook his head and said with a smile "What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys See you later, can I have them please?" And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man on the moon When you comin' home son? I don't know when, but we'll get together then son You know we'll have a good time then I've long since retired, my son's moved away I called him up just the other day I said, "I'd like to see you if you don't mind" He said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I can find the time You see my new job's a hassle and kids have the flu But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad It's been sure nice talking to you" And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me He'd grown up just like me My boy was just like me And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man on the moon When you comin' home son? I don't know when, but we'll get together then son You know we'll have a good time then

The 22-year-old said that his 19-year-old wife-to-be has “had a positive effect” on him dressing better and gushed that she is “an extremely strong, intelligient, support person.”
While preparing for his role in the blockbuster hit ‘The Hunger Games’, Liam revealed that he had to embark on a tough diet to slim down by 20lbs for the role, just a month before filming.
“It was tough, because I’m an eater,” Liam told the magazine, before adding that the diet had left him “in a really bad mood, with short attention span and short fuse.”
And while Miley has been shedding the pounds as part of her new regime, Liam has revealed that he’s got a major love for Krispy Kreme doughnuts.

Way out west, where the kangaroo’s play, there is a whole lot of nothing… but there are also some pretty amazing natural sights that are so beautiful, so unique and so incredible, it is worth the long-haul drive!
Tours to Go is one of Australia’s best tour agencies, with a number of exciting and interesting thing to do in Outback Western Australia, including a number of tours with Pinnacle Tours Australia. Adams Pinnacle Tours have been running tours out west for over 30 years and trust me, compared to a rough road trip and the (very expensive) petrol costs to get there and back, the comfy coaches are the best way to travel. Air-conditioning, commentary and comfort stops to ensure you get a good stretch- don’t attempt to do this on your own!
Pinnacle Tours not only head north of Perth, they head to a sacred aboriginal land in the Wheatbelt, where Wave Rock lies. The York, Wildflowers and Wave Rock tour is great for those who want to kick back, enjoy a very relaxing day onboard a comfy coach and write, listen to music or have a good sleep. This tour has a number of stops that are of interest to the history buff, so sit back and enjoy the commentary.
First stop- the colonial town of York. This tiny one-street township is filled with antiquities, architecture and Aussie spirit. Make sure you grab yourself some snacks and a toilet break for the ride ahead, it’s a long way!
A number of stops before our main attraction, Wave Rock, with a beautiful tribute to the working dogs (that can work on farms for 15 years!!!) with the Corrigan Dog Cemetery, Hippo’s Yawn and then Lunch in Hyden!
After a long, interesting journey into the South-East of the Wheatbelt- we reach our ultimate goal. Wave Rock is the artwork of mother nature and 130 million years of granite formations. Simply Breathtaking. Walk the trails on top, pretend to surf the wave or just take in it’s beauty.
Following Wave Rock, we head to Mulka’s Cave. Ancient Aboriginal dreamtime stories relay that Mulka was a child born from Taboo, failing to complete the hunting initiations, he ran away to live on his own in this beautiful cave. Mulka was a terrible, mentally-ill young man born from sin, who stole young babies from his own tribe to eat. Trackers were set out by his tribe to murder him for his crimes, while Mulka’s mother ran to warn him, he killed her and was then speared by the tribesman. The cave is said to be haunted by the evil soul, with red hand prints warning visitors of the spirit that lies within.
On the way back to Perth, you have a few hours to sit back and relax, sleep or read, with the sunset and city lights out your window.
Wow! Australia has so much to offer!! I’m planning on doing some more interstate travel this year (I’m based in Melbourne). Wave rock is definitely added to my must see list now!
When I finally get to crossing outback Australia off my bucket list, I’ll have to consider using Tours to Go. Looks like it was a fantastic adventure! http://nomoneywilltravel.com
The pictures are stunning! Australia is huge, we need to live there to enjoy this country at its fullest!! I’ve only been in the East Coast and I definitely wanna go on the West Coast… It looks incredible!! Like in yr pics 🙂
Arrangements to visit the Central Air Force Museum in Monino, about 40 kilometers as the crow lies from Moscow, must be made two weeks in advance. That's what the guidebook stated. Since it's a functioning Air Force garrison, visiting foreigners must fax their passport information and be accompanied by a Russian citizen. That's what the museum's website (Russian only) stated and the museum's receptionist reiterated over the phone. If not arriving by car, which would have to be registered, visitors had to take a taxi. Foreigners weren't supposed to take local busses or walk into the garrison.
As often happens in Russia, rules evaporate in practice. One never knows when they might be enforced, but rarely do Russians ever show concern about following rules to the letter. The taxi drivers at Monino seemed perplexed by the gaggle of foreigners bargaining for rides. Clearly they hadn't had much business ferrying foreigners to the museum. The ride cost 100 rubles or 4 US dollars.
No rules applied to getting back. Once we walked out of the museum, we were on our own. There's no taxi stand at the museum, so some of us flagged down local cars to get back to the train station. I made the 20-minute walk back with an Israeli tourist who latched on to our group while touring the exhibits. He visited without a Russian hostage, so that rule seems flexible in practice, too.
To get to Monino, we took the elektrichka, or suburban train, from the Yaroslavl train station in Moscow. The round trip ticket cost 125 rubles or 5 U.S. dollars, trains were frequent and the trip took about 90 minutes.
During the train ride, Russians walked the aisles selling items such as: document holders, magazines, blinking rubber balls, shower curtains, ironing board covers, art books, glasscutters, etc. Passengers seriously interested in the glasscutter could get an on-the-spot demonstration. Since the train schedule was set to change in a couple weeks, these entrepreneurs found a ready market for newly printed schedules.
Unlike last year on the elektrichka, no beer was sold. The loudspeakers blared why: "Smoking and the drinking of alcoholic beverages are strictly forbidden." During the announcement, the man behind me guzzled vodka and in front a teenager chugged beer. Nobody smoked.
We left the museum's small headquarters building and headed for a field. The building housed several interesting exhibits, such as one showing the successful performance of Soviet aircraft against the Americans during the Korean War. Unfortunately, a fire had required temporarily housing these exhibits in the administration building, and they weren't available for viewing.
It was early May, and a biting wind blew snow flurries into our faces. Our guide was Aleksey, a former test pilot who began flying in the early 1950s and had flown some of the almost 200 aircraft on display. A few of them were foreign, such as the American Lend-Lease planes from WWII, but most were Russian.
Guides aren't required, but you'd miss a lot without one. Aleksey's commentary was that of a professional. If he thought an aircraft was good, he said so and explained why. If it had major design failures, he explained them, too. Aleksey appeared to have an especially warm spot for the MiG-25 (Foxbat) and the Sukhoi-27 (Flanker). The major Soviet aviation design bureaus were represented: Tupolev, Mikoyan, Mil, Sukhoi, Yakovlev, Beriyev, Myassischev, Lyul'ka, Ilyushin, Antonov, Kanov.
Aleksey did delve into politics briefly when he mentioned disdainfully how Khrushchev had single-handedly set back Soviet military aviation by canceling the production of several promising new aircraft and by decreeing that in the future in the sky would belong to rockets.
Don't expect slick, Disney-like exhibits with lots of interactive features and fancy graphics. The museum is a huge outdoor parking lot with an adjacent building. Parked in rows are glistening metallic war horses: strategic bombers and missile carriers designed to carry nuclear weapons for killing hundreds of thousands of the enemy; attack aircraft to support advancing lines of ground units laying waste to enemy cities; and fighter interceptors, challenging attacking enemy aircraft. The adjacent building houses some quaint early 20th century aircraft, many of which were designed for military roles.
Thoughtful Americans or West Europeans should realize that this war machinery targeted them. These aircraft were designed to kill them and destroy their aircraft. Aleksey, a professional soldier, knew this instinctively, so he could easily talk about the good and bad of aircraft models much in the same way soldiers likely talked about horse breeds in the 19th century. He also spoke reverently about Soviet ace WWII pilots, such as Ivan N. Kozhedub (Russian only) who later commanded Soviet pilots against the Americans in Korea.
The museum is a work of love, not public relations. It presupposes some basic knowledge on the visitor's part and a passion for military aircraft. An independent English language website on the museum provides further information for aviation enthusiasts.
The museum also reflects the vast national resources that the Soviet Union devoted to building military aircraft. How to realistically restructure this complex, so as to maintain national defense, become competitive on foreign markets and keep tens of thousands of jobs, remains one of President Putin's major headaches. It will certainly be a headache for his successor, too.

“After John Muranka had taken one session with the team, I knew we were onto something special. The atmosphere is calmer and more positive. I can see how the whole business will be transformed”
“I now believe in my own abilities and strengths. I thought coaching was teaching but actually it was helping me tune into my own resourcefulness. I have amazed myself in the discipline and structure I have created. I have a huge well of resources now that I tap into. My expectations were completely surpassed.”
“John Muranka was able to clear huge blocks in a key business relationship. Consequently, my performance in everything I was doing increased.”
“I was able to get a new project and career move off the ground - which brought a lot of happiness into my life”
“John Muranka turned around a situation where an executive was close to being asked to leave because of frustrations in the rest of the team. The same executive went on to become a highly respected, key player in the organisation.”
“There is a dramatic increase in morale in the organisation. We are all more understanding of each other, more supportive, flexible and all committed to a common goal.”
“Moving up to compete against world championship level competitors was a big step. At first I was overawed, but John Muranka taught me that my own mind was my biggest competitor."
“Excellent, I never thought it would be that good. I am much more aware of myself and I have been able to create a life change. John Muranka helped me do it myself.”
“John Muranka’s coaching has been crucial to my business success for many years. I have achieved much more than I thought I could. My clients include multi-million pound companies operating in many countries, so there are always issues to be resolved – John helps me to keep rising to the challenges!”
“I didn’t realise how much a personal loss had been effecting my performance. I would never have spotted it or dealt with it without you – Thank you, John.”
“John has helped me to recognise my abilities, which has increased my confidence and in turn has substantially improved my performance at work. John, the coaching has been a life changing experience…thank you.”
“John Muranka has been able to pull things together for me. I am much more aware of how I am in the business and can see others differently. My team are in much better shape and better informed. I can now see the strategies for the next 5 years more clearly.”
“This was exactly what we needed. It has been a really, really good experience. Very positive. I am much more relaxed in the environment, more confident, more assertive and able to contribute much more.”
“The day was stimulating and opened up a new level of communication and understanding between all members of the production team. My concerns that some members of the team would not ‘buy in' to the approach proved unfounded, with everyone displaying remarkable openness and honesty. I believe we have taken the first step toward developing a world class management team that understands personal and team accountabilities and has the will and authority to challenge the status quo that exists within the business.”
"When my mind is right, I have got better starts, I have overtaken people easier, I feel more complete inside and can better cope with set-backs so that my performance isn’t effected.”
“Thought-provoking - plenty of mental material to take away - team alignment achieved. John is a powerful presenter. I could see no weaknesses.”
“John's coaching has allowed me to challenge people in a more forthright and honest way. And for that to be understood by the recipient.”
“John Muranka's training was informative and interesting. It was probably the best day's training I have had whilst being with the company. The major success was the resulting willingness and openness of the production team to make the day a success. The only weakness was that it felt like one day was not long enough. We all wanted more.”
“Quite a surprise – I broke through a strong in-built negative belief that I didn’t even realise was there. It shifted me from being a low achiever to being able to achieve anything.”
“Ultimately we as a team feel more able to communicate and be understood which will allow us to be more effective as a team.”
“John Muranka has forced me to re- evaluate how I communicate with others and interact within the team.”
“John Muranka's coaching was greatly needed and did prove where everyone stood in the team. I think it would be beneficial in all departments for team building and motivation.”
“The training was successful in helping my team realise how we all need each other's help to be able to provide excellent service to the client. Personally the training reinforced that I need to ‘listen’ better and work on how I relate to my team.”
“John Muranka's coaching makes you stop and think about your actions and how you react to situations. I now realise how my interaction with other people affects moods, emotions and responses.”
“I thought it was very useful and quite strong in the way it made me feel more positive. It will help me to motivate and communicate better with my team”
“I am more aware of the team's contribution now, which should help us to work more closely together in the future.”
“I thought John Muranka's training was very good, it made me think more deeply about myself and how things can affect my attitude. It also made me think positively - whatever is thrown at me.”
“I think John Muranka's course was first class. It brought to a head many issues and hopefully has paved the way to a better future for the team.”
“John Muranka was very good he had a calm manner and managed to get even the stubbornest of people talking.”
“Being able to laugh at myself is important and John often re-framed my thoughts so that I could see the funny side. I really enjoyed that!”
“John Muranka has a very intuitive coaching style which has worked amazingly well for me. It was important for me to deal with old ghosts. I felt like John guided that well and that despite the detour, I have still moved forward. The tools and exercises John gave me were of real benefit, and the fact that John had done them himself, and was able to share his experience was really useful.”
Will the slaughter ever end? During the past year, ABC has cavalierly dismissed some of its greatest stars - Finola Hughes, James DePaiva, Linda Dano, Kin Shriner, and Marcy Walker, just to name a few - in favor of new, young, and often inexperienced actors. And now Ilene Kristen has been added to the list. The actress, who plays trashy opportunist Roxy Balsom on One Life to Live, has been told that her contract will not be renewed when it runs out next month. According to an ABC publicist, "There is no more story for Roxy."
And that has Kristen mystified. "I'm really scratchin' my ass over this one," says the veteran star, who saw her airtime start to decrease last spring after she got an Emmy nomination. "I'm not mad, but it makes no sense. Roxy is so bent, so delightfully inappropriate - the possibilities for her were endless."
It certainly seemed so. Kristen, who earned legend status as the original Delia on ABC's Ryan's Hope, joined OLTL in 2001 and was so quickly embraced by viewers that the writers gave Roxy two adult offspring and a mom (the inimitable Sylvia Miles). Alas, ABC Daytime chief Brian Frons - who was hired after Kristen's arrival - did not share the fans' enthusiasm.
"But there's nothing I'd have done differently," Kristen says. "I'm a pro. I suit up and I show up, ready to act full throttle - and I can do that somewhere else. I'm sad, but I'm being very Zen. Who knows? Maybe this is a gift."

I've been playing for several years on the server Daggerspine (EU) but since January of 2013 I've been transferring my Rogue to the server named Kazzak (EU). The population of Kazzak is higher on the Horde side then on the alliance side. Kazzak is an PvP server, but most of the guilds are raiding guilds. But still there are enough PvP guilds, so no worries.
Reason why is left Daggerspine is because it's a low server, and so there was a low amount of PvP-ers
I haven't been playing WoW for over a month now, but i guess later this summer/year, i'll be back playing WoW.
Haha yea it's too bad the server died.. On what server are you playing now then? of did ya quit playing WoW?
Haha, well same here indeed. But school is over in a few day's here, so maybe returning back this Thursday.. I also heard that patch 5.4, the raid of Orgrimmar, should be really a nice patch.
Im on Thunderhorn but that server is also dieing and I only really play once or twice a week as our guild is no longer big enough to raid and nobody really has the energy to try and resuscitate it.
I will be collecting gear from the new Ogrimmar raid through LFR when its released and will probably continue until the next expansion, but I do not think I will be buying anymore expansions. I think level 90 is the end for me.
I'm on dragonblight and Silvermoon if any of you guys decide to pay a visit, main on dragonblight is Malvalek, 90 alliance DK, on Silvermoon it's Dógsbody, 90 alliance druid
Hate to say it, but I've started playing WoW again since last week.. But i'm lying when i say it doesn't feel good to kill some 'lame' Alliance's peeps agian!!
Haha, i only activated wow because i have a lan party in 3 weeks ^^. But when thats over, i'm not sure if i go on playing
Still a reason I try to convince myself that I need to win a battleground each day Quick win = more CSS =D

Isabel Martin Lewis (July 11, 1881 – July 31, 1966) was an American astronomer who was the first woman hired by the United States Naval Observatory as assistant astronomer. In 1918, Lewis was elected a member of the American Astronomical Society. She was also a member of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific.
Isabel Martin was born in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, on July 11, 1881.[1] Lewis earned her A.B. from Cornell University in 1903 and earned her A.M. there in 1905, specializing in mathematics.[1] From 1905 to 1907 she was an "astronomical computer" for Simon Newcomb. Under Newcomb, Martin worked on eclipse data, an experience that would prove essential to her later work.
Lewis began work as a computer at the Nautical Almanac Office in 1908. Although Lewis was not the first woman to be hired by the Naval Observatory (this was Maria Mitchell, who in 1849 was hired as a computer), Lewis was the first woman to be hired as assistant astronomer. At the NAO, Lewis met her husband, Clifford Spencer Lewis, another astronomer. They were married on December 4, 1912.[1]
With the birth of her son, Robert Winslow Lewis, Lewis worked only part-time at the observatory and began an effort to popularize science.
Writing three books and countless articles, Lewis started in 1916 to reach out to a popular audience about the wonders of astronomy and earth science. Her columns appeared in the New York Evening Sun, the Electrical Experimenter (later known as Science and Invention), Popular Astronomy, The Scientific Monthly, and the Astronomical Journal, among others. For thirty years, Lewis had a monthly column in Nature Magazine (this title was published by the American Nature Association and should not be confused with the journal Nature). Introducing her first article in Electrical Experimenter, editor Hugo Gernsback praised Lewis for her exactitude and learning, saying that she "has the rare faculty of interpreting difficult and dry subjects in a popular manner."[2]
The articles from the Sun were combined into a 1919 book, Splendors of the Sky, and her articles before 1922 in Science and Invention were included in the second part of her book Astronomy for Young Folks. In addition, in "News of the Stars" she gave lectures on the local radio station (WRC) and made presentations at schools and churches.
Lewis returned to full-time work after her husband's death in 1927. On October 1, 1927 Lewis was promoted to Assistant Scientist. Lewis was further promoted to the rank of Astronomer in 1930.
A specialist in eclipses, at the Naval Observatory Lewis derived a faster and more accurate method to determine where an eclipse would be visible. She also found a way to predict more occultations of the moon; these moments when the moon passed before other heavenly bodies were used to investigate the moon's orbit. Her new method for calculating solar eclipses allowed for a level of detail that could be used to understand the ionosphere.
During this period, she participated in expeditions to view the solar eclipse of June 19, 1936 in Russia. Also, she organized and participated in the Hayden Planetarium-Grace Eclipse Expedition to Peru to view, photograph, and broadcast by radio the solar eclipse of June 8, 1937.[3]
Lewis retired from service at the Naval Observatory in 1951 but continued to publish in newspapers and magazines until 1955.[1] The length of her career and her prominence are unlike that of other women in astronomy; according to Lankford and Stavings, only 12% of women astronomers from 1900-1940 had careers longer than 25 years.[4]

John Haley "Zoot" Sims (October 29, 1925 – March 23, 1985) was an American jazz saxophonist, playing mainly tenor but also alto (and, later, soprano) saxophone.[1] He first gained attention in the "Four Brothers" sax section of Woody Herman's big band, afterward enjoying a long solo career, often in partnership with fellow saxmen Gerry Mulligan and Al Cohn, and the trombonist Bob Brookmeyer.
Sims was born in 1925 in Inglewood, California to vaudeville performers Kate Haley and John Sims.[2] His father was a vaudeville hoofer, and Sims prided himself on remembering many of the steps his father taught him. Growing up in a performing family, he learned to play drums and clarinet at an early age. His brother was the trombonist Ray Sims.[3]
Following in the footsteps of Lester Young, Sims developed into an innovative tenor saxophonist. Throughout his career, he played with big bands, starting with those of Kenny Baker and Bobby Sherwood after dropping out of high school after one year. He played with Benny Goodman's band in 1943 and replaced his idol Ben Webster in Sid Catlett's Quartet in 1944.[4][5]
Sims served as a corporal in the United States Army Air Force from 1944 to 1946,[5] then returned to music in the bands of Artie Shaw, Stan Kenton, and Buddy Rich. He was one of Woody Herman's "Four Brothers". He frequently led his own combos and toured with his friend Gerry Mulligan's sextet, and later with Mulligan's Concert Jazz Band. Sims rejoined Goodman in 1962 for a tour of the Soviet Union.[5]
In the 1950s and '60s, Sims had a long, successful partnership as co-leader of a quintet with Al Cohn, which recorded under the name "Al and Zoot". The group was a favorite at New York City's Half Note Club. Always fond of the higher register of the tenor sax, he also played alto and late in his career added soprano saxophone to his performances, while recording a series of albums for the Pablo Records label of the impresario Norman Granz. He also played on some of Jack Kerouac's recordings.[6]
Sims acquired the nickname "Zoot" early in his career while he was in the Kenny Baker band in California.[citation needed] The name was later appropriated for a saxophone-playing Muppet on The Muppet Show.
Sims played a 30-second solo on the song "Poetry Man", written by singer Phoebe Snow on her debut eponymous album in 1975.[citation needed]. He also played on Laura Nyro's "Lonely Women," on her album "Eli and the Thirteenth Confession."
Zoot Sims died of cancer on March 23, 1985 in New York City,[4] and is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery, in Nyack, New York.

I’m not sure if she’s right that she could be happier. Neither does she. But it’s the dilemma of long term relationships. People who don’t want to be single long for the stability and security of commitment. But achieving such things requires an absence of drama, and even passion. As another friend once said to me, “you can’t have everything, where would you put it?”
Falling passionately in love is thrilling. You’re energised and glowing, the sex is glorious and you can’t wipe the smile off your face or keep your hands off each other. But love at that intensity can’t last.
Despite what the MRAs love to claim, women are not as likely to commit violence as men. The facts are that almost all violence crimes are committed by men. My article on the actual data about male violence.
Jan Mark lived in Oxford. She was born in Welwyn, Hertfordshire on 22 June 1943. Jan grew up in North London and Kent. She was educated at the Ashford County Grammar School (read Jane Sherman's text on their Ashford period) and the Canterbury College of Art where she got a National Diploma in Design in 1965.
Jan taught at a North Kent secondary school from 1965 till 1971, and started writing in 1974. She frequently visited schools and libraries, and lectured abroad. In the early 1980s Jan became Writer in Residence in the education department of the Oxford Polytechnic, now called Oxford Brookes University. It was in that capacity that American writer Terry Farrish learnt to know her. Read Terry's essay on Jan Mark's role in her writing career.
In Flanders (Belgium) she played an essential role in an important innovation in English language teaching, the use of youth literature.

Meat rubs are a fantastic and simple way to add flavor and gusto to everyday meals! Basically, a rub is a mixture of spices and herbs that are “rubbed” directly to your meat before cooking. What makes Rub 1 Out meat rubs different is a flavor that is going to make your next outdoor event a Celebration of Flavor!
We provide three different rubs for the three basic meats including beef, pork, and chicken. This is a dry rub made with spices and seasonings only. Many chefs prefer dry rubs for grilling because the meat won’t burn. this also makes them perfect if you will be cooking for long times, like briskets and ribs.
Rub 1 Out is any mixture of ground spices that is made for the purpose of being rubbed on raw food before the food is cooked. The spice rub forms a coat on the food. The food can be marinated in the spice rub for some time for the flavors to incorporate into the food or it can be cooked immediately after it is coated in the rub.
The spices are usually coarsely ground. In addition to spices, salt and sugar may be added to the rub, the salt for flavor and the sugar for caramelization. The simplest rub is just coarsely ground black pepper as in Steak au poivre. Rub 1 Out can also have ingredients such as herbs, crushed garlic or oil added to make a paste. The spice rub can be left on or partially removed before cooking.

Daren the resulting immortalization, its very contradictory zodiac signs dating compatibility dapple.

The name of the song that sounds like an accordion playing is: Stereo Love. Since the name of the song is never heard in its lyrics the title has been a bit elusive. Seems everyone loves the song, but no one knows the name of it. The song is by Edward Maya and Vika Jigulina and is indeed entitled Stereo Love. Some call it techno but most people just know that it sounds like it has an accordion playing and sounds a little bit European. People searching for the name of the song have described it as Italian, French, Spanish and even Irish. Some have a more broad term and simply say European.
Others search for the most recognizable lyrics such as, "baby I run, but I'm running to you," and "I'm hiding inside," or "When you gonna stop breaking my heart?" In any event, now you know. Enjoy watching the video (below) and learn more about this awesome song. If you want to purchase the song, album or extended version of this song, you'll find those links on this page.
The video was filmed in Greece and the man and woman in the video are indeed Edward Maya and Vika Jigulina who sing the song.
Many of the lyrics are hard to make out. The words are spoken rather softly by Vika Jigulina but there are a few that most people can pick up on such as:
Quick Poll - Were you looking for the name of the song? - Maybe you searched for the terms "Accordion" and/or "Techno"
There's just something about this song. It's hugely popular as a dance song especially in Europe, but also has a romantic appeal (did you see the video?). Recorded in 2009, "Stereo Love" is a song by musician Edward Maya (Romanian) featuring Vika Jigulina (Romanian, but born in Russia). It was released as Maya's debut single from his album of the same name. The basis for the song came from another song "Bayatilar" composed by musician Eldar Mansurov (more on that story below). The song quickly became a worldwide hit first in discos all over Europe. America soon followed and now the hunt is on by millions of fans to learn the name of the song.
Starting in 2006, Edward Maya worked with several Romanian artists, but launched is own first song as an artist in 2009 - Stereo Love. Stereo Love is a record breaking smash hit as the longest charting song in the European 100. Maya has released two more singles "This is My Life" and "Desert Rain" both also featuring Vika Jigulina (see more info on these 2 songs when you scroll down).
Here's the face to put with the voice in the song. A soft flowing voice matches up perfectly with the music.
Oh it's all straightened out now, but there was a copyright issue with Edward Maya's Stereo Love song. It seems Maya heard an accordion version of a song entitled "Bayatilar" in 2009 and was fascinated by it. "Bayatilar" was composed by Eldar Mansurov (an Azerbaijani musician, composer and songwriter) in 1989 and released by a Brilliant Dadashova (an Azerbaijani pop singer). Smitten by the song, Maya says he tried to contact the author but failed due to his busy schedule.
Mansurov somehow learned about Maya's Stereo Love song and contacted the Romanian Office of Copyright (Edward Maya is Romanian). Maya later confirmed that Mansuov's Bayatilar was indeed used in the making of Stereo Love. The two gentlemen met and signed an agreement of co-authorship. All is well.
If you like Stereo Love you will also like two newer releases by Maya and Jigulina, This Is My Life and Desert Rain. These two artists make a masterful pair in the techno dance genre. The central theme of all three songs seems to be lovers seeking each other striving to fulfill their love. The songs are quite romantic. Take a listen to them below.

theres also that's my name by accent great song took me forever to find it hope it helps those who couldn't find it
This is my first exposure to this song - I like it, though. I found this lens while searching for lenses on the keyword Accordion - because that's the word I chose for my Quest of Blessing things I love. :) Blessed!
What a fun song! My dad had played the accordion for years - there was no Techno back then, but he would have enjoyed it! Thanks for the nice lens!
This is another song I wondered about after I first heard it! I didn't know the name of it back then, but I loved the accordion-esque effects and the fast paced beat it had. I finally figured out what it was called by searching the web, but this is a great lens for people who are trying to find out what the name of the song is after hearing it. The song is very distinctive, and this is another one of my most recent favorites. Thanks again!

After much hoopla leading up to the opening of the search engine giant, Google, eBookstore became a reality on December 6, 2010. For now, the purchase of titles through this new online service is available only in the United States.
Having spent the previous six years digitizing over 15 million print publications, the company is tooting its own horn about being the largest online e-book provider on the Internet. On opening day, approximately 3 million titles are available for purchase and download through eBookstore. There is no word yet when more titles will be available.
Google placed its eBookstore in the Cloud service, meaning that no special tech device is needed to access the book store or its offerings. People can access their online books directly from a computer, through an iPad, iPhone, or iPod with touch and even through Barnes & Noble's Nook or Sony's eReader. Just don't try it with Amazon's Kindle--it isn't available there.
Visiting the first page of the eBookstore, accessed at http://books.google.com/ebooks, you can pick up three free titles: "Great Expectations," "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and "Pride and Prejudice." Not a bad start to an online reading collection.
In addition to the many digitized books, Google also has deals with a number of book publishers that will be making new titles available to eBookstore.
In truth, I prefer my book reading the old-fashioned way, but if I decide to try e-books, it will be through the Google eBookstore because I don't have to purchase any additional equipment or applications to enjoy my selections.
It's difficult to give a straightforward answer to this question without qualifying it by saying there will doubtless always be paper books and the people who love them. For many others, e-readers are already very popular technology.
On June 1, 2011, Google announced that more than 2.5 million downloads of e-books have occurred since December 2010. There's no way to know that if e-readers were not available, would the public have bought or borrowed paper books to the same extent that they have downloaded e-books?
My guess is no, not to the same extent. We've become a technology-savvy culture, and many people would not be without their iPhones, notebooks, laptops or e-readers these days.
Kikalina, I'm glad to hear you enjoy your Kindle. I've heard good things from a number of Kindle owners and am considering getting one for my mom.
Mrslagibb, I hear you there. There are so many times I've gotten online with one idea in mind, but become sidetracked with other information I find along the way.
Very imformative, I love to read also, I am back for more later, to see how to read books on line for free. Every time i find a good title I want, or a title I know about, I done quite seem to get there to read it. I either get passed on to another site or I lose the search altogether going from one site to another.
Tlmcgaa70, I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you on that Ipad. There's nothing like being able to relax in a comfy chair and snuggle up with a good read, no matter what the format is.
great hub...voted up and shared on facebook as well as my followers. i also prefer reading books the old fashioned way, but sometimes i do read them online, like when i want to read something now and do not wish for snail mail to send it to me. it is convenient, but reading from the computer screen can become uncomfortable to say the least. i would love to be able to afford an ipad. maybe someday.
Will be sharing this one, as everyone loves a freebie and so many have either a kindle or table now ... at the very least, they work on a PC!

If 6 acres of grass, together with what grows on the 6 acres during the time of grazing, keep 16 oxen for 12 weeks, and 9 acres keep 26 oxen 9 weeks, how many oxen will 15 acres keep 10 weeks, the grass growing uniformly all the time?
I have created a pedal point script tool (based on a given triangle) on GSP 4.0. This tool show the pedal point, pedal triangle of a parent triangle as well as the four centers for the parent triangle. If you have the software you may want to use it.
Pedal Point - the point of intersection of the lines perpendicular to the lines containing the sides of a triangle.
The construction is quite simple. First start with a triangle and an aribitrary point off the triangle.
Now since the pedal point is perpendciular to the lines containing the three sides of we need to extend the sides of the triangle as so:
At this point the dashed lines are little use to us so we can eliminate them to form our pedal triangle.
The pedal point has some interesting loci based on a path of the pedal point. Let's pull the pedal point back outside of the triangle and we can put the pedal point on the path of a circle. What I think is interesting is to find the locus of one of the midpoints of the pedal triangle with the circular path of the pedal point.
It appears as if the locus of the midpoint is that of an ellipse. Now let's compare the loci of the three midpoints of the pedal triangle.
It appears as if all three loci are ellipsi. Notice it does not matter even though we changed the magnitude of the parent triangle.
Not let's change the path of the pedal point and put the path on a circle that contains the circumcenter, C, of the parent triangle
It still appears to be three ellipsi. So lets make the circle smaller than that of the circumcircle.
Still not much has changed it still appears to be three ellipsi. Now let's put the pedal point on the circumcircle of the parent triangle:
Though the loci seem to mirror all other previous examples the interesting thing is that the parent triangle has collapsed into what appears to be a line. In fact it does. A brief explanation:
By figure it appears that two of the vertices of the pedal triangle intersect two of the vertices of the parent triangle. as well as the three midpoints lie on a side of the parent triangle. The pedal point and the M1 lie on this perpendicular. since M1 is a midpoint it follow that the figure created by this situation is that of an isoceles triangle:
Hence the pedal triangle has collapsed into the base of an isoceles triangle with the pedal point as it's point of location of the vertex angle of the isoceles triangle.
This look at the loci of the pedal point and pedal triangle is a small look into what can be numerous investigations and proofs. Though we looked at a few examples what about others: the quarter points of the pedal triangle sides? the centers of the pedal triangle? maybe even looking at this in three dimensions? Feel free to go on and enjoy.
Now let see what happens when we compare the pedal point to other centers of the parent triangle. Because the pedal triangle is defined by using the idea of perpendicular we will focus on those centers that have perpendicular in it's respective definition.
By definition the orthocenter is the point of intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle meaning it it perpendicular with the sides. The resulting points of intersection with he sides of a triangle create the orthic triangle.
Earlier we defined the pedal triangle as the union of the points of intersection with an arbitrary point (pedal point) and the line containing the sides of a triangle. Clearly these definition have some intersection. In fact the orthic triangle is an example of a pedal triangle since it matches in definition making the orthocenter an example of a pedal point. So if we were to create a figure with an orthic triangle and a pedal triangle when the pedal point is moved on to the orthocenter the pedal triangle and orthic triangle will sit directly on top of each other. In fact by early definitions I have read that would correspond to congruency.
By definition the circumcenter is the point of the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle. The resulting point will be the center of a circle that crosses the triangle at it's vertices.
Clearly if the pedal point was the circumcenter the orthic triangle would be made up of the midpoints of the sides of the parent triangle.
Upon looking at the definition of the incenter of a triangle one might not think that there would be any relation between the these two ideas. Let's take a look:
The incenter is the center of the circle that is inscribed in a triangle. This circle will intersect the triangle at three points. These three points run from the incenter perpendicular to the sides:
Clearly that if the incenter is on the line perpendicular to the sides of at the points of intersection that if we chose the point I as a pedal point then these three points of intersection would be the vertices of the pedal triangle.
After looking at these two ideas I could not find much interesting except at specific cases of parent triangles, ex isoceles or equilateral. Maybe you can. Find one and email it to me.
I hope this look at pedal triangles and pedal points has been interesting. I hope that you understand the connections I have made in this write-up. If you have any questions or comments please email me from my home page and let me know.
Given any triangle, an altitude of the triangle is the perpendicular line drawn from one of the vertices to the opposite side.
Notice, when we created the orthocenter of triangle ABC, we divided the triangle into three more triangles (DBC, DAB, and DAC).
God has called a wonderfully diverse group of souls to this community of care and encouragement. We welcome all people into this fellowship -- just as they are, created by God.

The name of this blog is “Japanese Girls Nude” because we focus on hot girls from Japan that are totally new to the online adult world like Yuu here. Japanese girls are probably the hottest females in the world but you may get tired of the same old porn chicks every time. This site is for those who want something new and perhaps a little more personal and real. You won’t find this chick Yuu on any porn site or DVD. If you’re looking for established JAV idols, you can find those in hundred thousand other places on the web. I don’t need to point you in that direction I’m sure. Anyways, some of these ladies will be future porn idols in Japan and some are just getting off and having a good time on cam with no intention of going any further in the porn world. Whichever it is, you can be sure that these Japanese girls are the real deal for you to have cam sex with or just talk and get to know them…..and then have cam sex!

While Inclusion Daily Express does not usually cover politics or finding "cures" to disabilities, a story involving both of those has taken a very public detour right into our disability rights consciousness.
Last Monday, conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh used the airwaves to condemn Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson's disease, for appearing on television commercials supporting candidates who favor stem cell research.
This is an important issue for the television and movie actor, who, like the late actor Christopher Reeve, lobbied for federal funding for such research that is believed to hold promise for treating or preventing conditions associated with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and others.
What deserves attention, here, is how Limbaugh, who opposes stem cell research, characterized Fox's appearance on the ads: "He was either acting or off his medication . . . He is using his illness as a tactic to secure the election of another Democratic senator."
Fox later said that the irony is that he was too medicated; that the medication he uses to treat Parkinson's can actually increase the shaking and swaying seen on the ads.
Another irony is that Fox also supports Republican Senator Arlen Specter, from Pennsylvania, and other Republicans that support stem cell research.
Still a third irony is that Limbaugh is accusing Fox of using his disability for personal gain. This from a man who made a big deal out of receiving a cochlear implant in 2003 after losing his hearing as a result of Auto-Immune Inner Ear Disease, and publicly stated three years ago that he was seeking treatment for addiction to pain killing medication that was initially prescribed to treat his pain after spinal surgery.
While I won't climb onto the "research for a cure" bandwagon, I respect Fox's right to have his cause. I also respect how Fox, whose autobiography is titled "Lucky Man", has refused to portray himself and others with Parkinson's disease as "victims".
If you truly abhor the exploitation of disabilities, why not go and pick on someone else, like, say, Jerry Lewis?
If he came out to exploit his disability to get a liberal DFLer elected, then he opens himself up for criticism. And, Arlen Spector? Spector is a RINO (Republican In Name Only). Spector is for abortion on demand (Including and not limited to late term abortions in case you happen to have "severe" disabilities, or Down's Syndrome or Spina Bifida).
There are those of us in the disability community that do not want human beings created to cure our family members, our children, or ourselves. If you are a person with a disability that supports EMBRYONIC stem cell research, then you are no different than the pro-abortion groups and those in the medical profession who support abortion on demand ESPECIALLY if you have a disability, or active euthanasia of people with disabilities.
MJ Fox deserves constructive criticism and debate over his appearance. His disability does not give him some "special needs" ticket to get out of criticism free card. Maybe Rush was not so constructive, but at least he had the guts to criticize MJ Fox.

Is your yoga routine getting a little stale? If you’re looking for a new challenge, yoga on a stand up paddleboard will reinvigorate you and push you to become an even better yogi than you thought possible — all while enjoying the natural splendor of floating on water. And it’s not just for the lucky few in tropical places like Hawaii. The S.U.P. yoga community is much larger than you’d expect, making it easier for you to find a convenient place to try it. Below, ten reasons you might want to:
Since the platform is unstable, you have to engage your core more for better balance. L.A.-based yoga instructor Dice lida-Klein told Men’s Fitness that the workout is more challenging. “Your whole midsection will have to work to keep you balanced and afloat. You have to work harder and focus more on the water.”
You’ll be more in tune with your poses, according to Namaste S.U.P. For example, during downward dog, if you have more weight on one side, your board will let you know.
The sensation of floating helps to alleviate the heaviness that life sometimes throws on our shoulders.
Ujjayi Pranayama, or Ocean Breath, is a popular yoga method for breathing because the “ocean” sound is believed to soothe your mind. And some researchers believe that listening to the sound of the ocean can help people to relax. The gentle sound of water lapping while on a paddleboard will help you relax and key you in to the most important aspect of yoga: your breath.
Standing up on a paddle board gives you a unique perspective of both the water and the horizon. It’s as close as you can get to walking on water, and the possibility of falling helps practitioners really focus on themselves and their poses. “It’s about letting go of the fear,” Teresa Van Eyk, owner of Satya Yoga in Saugatuck, MI, recently told the Holland Sentinel. “You get off the water feeling really rejuvenated. It’s empowering.”
It’s well-known that novelty is important in exercise regimens in order to stay motivated and happy. According to the National Institute of Health, “Mixing it up also helps to reduce boredom and cut your risk of injury.” There are many different types of yoga, but it’s still easy to fall into a rut. Trying paddleboard yoga will keep you on your toes.
The very real possibility of falling into the water provides just enough adrenaline to your workout to keep you focused and motivated. And that, explains Men’s Health, could help you fight the ill-effects of stress in your everyday life.
If you do fall in, you are forced to overcome the set-back, climb back up on your board, and try again — which is a life lesson in and of itself. Yoga-instructor lida-Klein says that conquering the fear of falling in is essential. “The quicker you become okay with falling into the water,” he told Men’s Fitness, “the better you’ll feel and the easier it will be.”
When the board is your mat, there’s less room for error. If you feel like you’ve started to master your normal yoga class, it’s time you tried this:
Between breathing fresh air, soaking up vitamin D and enjoying the natural landscape, it beats just about any gym or studio out there. “Yoga means ‘union,’” Hilary Kimblin, owner of Yoga Under the Trees in Beverley Hills, CA, told Yoga Journal. “When it’s practiced outdoors it seems like the union with nature, humanity, and the universe is truly felt.”

Infidelity is a complex issue. There are several types of infidelity, and not all types involve physical contact. However, all occurrences of infidelity are extremely harmful to a relationship.
The signs of infidelity are signs, not proof. Seeing indications of infidelity in your spouse is extremely stressful, draining and heart breaking, but they are not conclusive. This is when you need to know the truth.
There have been times where our clients have found signs of possible infidelity and our investigation indicated that no infidelity was taking place. A ‘mid life crises’ often produces signs like changes in appearance and suddenly embarking on an exercise program, without infidelity taking place. Other problems within a relationship can cause a spouse to pull away and become more distant, without infidelity being involved.
2. Starting arguments. Many people who are cheating in a relationship will argue or complain more about their spouse in an effort to justify their behavior. Some people react in the opposite way and become very passive.
3. They are working longer or different hours; Changes in time spent at work, or away from the family.

Today’s Thoughts for the Day got me thinking about things I wrote while wearing the robes of business owner and association executive. Naturally, after reading the post that was the genesis of my Thoughts for the Day, I spent some time reading old business blog posts. Some of my posts were deadly dull in the extreme. But I remain proud of others, especially because I espoused views that are contrary to so much of what is mainstream thinking in business today and, in particular, in association business.
The one post of which I am especially proud did not generate any responses. Indeed, I never attempted to promote my company blog, so it’s probably nobody but me ever read it. That matters not. What matters to me is that I put my thoughts into words and I put my words online for anyone to see. I read the post this morning and thought to myself, “hey, I used to be smart.” Seriously, I’m proud of what I wrote, more for the ideas I espoused than the manner in which I presented them. I wish I had done more to encourage readership of the old company blog. (I did invite my clients to read each of my posts, but they rarely did.) You can read the original post here, but I’ll reproduce it in its entirety below, just because…
Let me explain the title. Or maybe I won’t. Maybe we’ll see whether—after you read what I have to say—it’s as obvious to you as it is to me.
Experienced association executives, as well as less-experienced but no less committed people who are relatively new to the field, frequently talk about what it takes to be “successful” in association management. My first reaction to the question usually is that the success of an individual generally depends on the collective intelligence of the boards with which they work…the smarter the board, the more likely the association executive will be successful.
Obviously, it’s not quite that simple, but there is, in my experience, a very direct correlation. Lest you think that I place all the responsibility, and lay all the blame, on boards, let me clarify by saying this:
Assuming an individual is relatively intelligent and can adapt to a diverse set of personal styles among board members, he or she is very likely to be at least moderately successful, provided he or she is dealing with board members who are intelligent enough to leave the bulk of their personal agendas and biases outside the board room. And, of course, provided he or she has sufficient personal integrity to focus on what is best for the association and its members. No matter how committed, though, someone of average or below average intelligence generally is not suited to association management; the likelihood of encountering board members who demand quick wits and intellectual capacity in their executives is simply too great.
In case you wonder what the underlying message is here, let me be clear: to be successful in association management does not require dazzling brilliance. Success can be had by anyone who is intelligent, well-informed, well-read, and tolerant of different personality styles. Of course, those people who enjoy success must also make it their business to learn and fully absorb a vast amount on information and knowledge relating to association management. This information and knowledge ranges from leadership theory to antitrust law to financial management to risk management to strategic deployment of technology…and on and one. And, of course, the successful association executive must maneuver around or re-educate the occasional board member who is politically or morally corrupt.
Before going any further, it’s important to understand what I’m referring to when I say “successful association executive.” What I’m referring to is someone who is recognized as a leader by the board members and association members with whom he or she works and who helps lead the association to accomplish its objectives. Beyond that, a successful association executive helps boards articulate direction for the association and brings disparate groups of members and staff together so that they understand and embrace the “cause” for which the association works.
Thus far, when I have spoken of success, I have referred to success with a little “s.” When we start talking about Success with a capital “S,” we begin talking about characteristics that go beyond above average intelligence and integrity.
The world of the Successful Association Executive is experienced only by those association executives who possess personality and intellectual traits that place them in the rarified atmosphere of ‘homo universalis.’ These are people who think deeply and who refuse to allow their ideas to be bound by commonly-held or conventional beliefs. They tend to acknowledge and value the contributions to mankind of all cultures, recoiling at what they perceive to be the rabid ignorance of provincialists, hyperpatriots, anarchists, and others who are nothing if not certain that their points of view are right.
What is the definition of “capital S” success? In my view, it is what makes an association stand out as a beacon or role model for others. And what “it” is is a recognized sense of moral authority and leadership that comes not from blind adherence to dogma but from careful assertions of principle based on a comprehensive understanding of facts.
An association that wields tremendous power without capturing a sense of true leadership is not successful. I could name plenty of examples, but that would do no good. Examples of organizations that do exemplify the exhibition of moral authority and leadership (though not without their own share of stumbles) include the American Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders). While it’s rare for the “average” association to have sufficient power in its mission to justify a sense of morality, it’s not impossible. Associations that have contributed to standards that benefit the public at large in some way (e.g., standardized sizes of canned foods, standard sizes of tires, standard sizes and nomenclature for screws and nails, standard ways of planting crops, etc.) may also claim a sense of service that translates quite well into the larger “morality” that I speak of here. But the local real estate association also can be a moral leader by helping its members collaborate on ways to help first-time homebuyers achieve homeownership and the business association can become that leader by helping struggling businesses obtain the knowledge and skills necessary to survive and prosper.
The people who lead those associations (or who led them through periods of growth or significant influence) are among those who probably fall into the category of Successful Association Executives. Successful Association Executives are much more than technicians who know the nuts and bolts of operating the small businesses they run (for that’s what most associations are).
Instead, they are people who share a vision with the volunteer leaders of the organization. They are people who challenge common wisdom, ask tough questions, set aggressive and challenging goals, and embrace disparate factions within and without the association.
They are the Muslims and Christians and Jews who would read books by Richard Dawkins; the atheists who would read 90 Minutes in Heaven; the liberals who would listen intently to Rush Limbaugh’s radio programs; or the hard-core right-wingers who would read Greg Palast’s Armed Madhouse.
Successful Association Executives tend to be “middle-of-the-roaders” in many facets of their lives because they can understand and appreciate so many points of view. They recognize the seeds of truth that often are hidden in the emotions that inform the opinions on all sides of particularly contentious issues. For that reason, among others, they tend to be excellent arbiters in difficult circumstances.

Halberg is riding to raise money for Water for Good, a Charis Fellowship cooperating ministry that works with local people to provide sustainable, lifesaving water access in the Central African Republic. His goal is to raise $5 for every mile he rides, for a total of $21,140.
The impact of this fundraiser could be huge. For every mile Halberg gets sponsored, one person will be provided with clean water for a year. If every mile is funded, that will allow 4,228 people access to the clean water they need.
“Jim Hocking, the founder of Water for Good, was in my first youth group 45 years ago when I became a youth pastor, and we have been good friends ever since. I have watched the development of Water for Good, and my wife and I have supported the ministry financially for several years. I love what the organization is doing and could not think of any cause I’d rather support,” says Halberg.
This “bikepacking” journey will start in Yorktown, Va., and will follow the TransAmerica Bike Route (formerly known as the Bicentennial Bike Route) to either Astoria or Florence, Ore., and it will take about three months to be completed.
“In Virginia, I will place my rear wheel in the Atlantic Ocean,” Halberg says. “The ride will end when I dip my front wheel in the Pacific Ocean in Oregon.”
Halberg will travel through 10 states: Virginia, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, and Oregon. He expects to sleep in hostels, churches, fire stations, and possibly some homes along the way, as well as camping in roadside shelters and campgrounds.
Halberg has been riding bikes his whole life. The first bike he bought was purchased with money from his first newspaper route at nine years old. The second bike he bought was a 10-speed Schwinn Varsity, which he bought in junior high.
Now, a few years later, Halberg has some help lined up for beginning this journey across the country.
“I plan to ship my bicycle to Williamsburg, Va., where my friend, Mark Penfold, the Chaplain Ministries’ Endorser for the Charis Fellowship, will pick up my bike for me,” says Halberg. “I will fly to Virginia, spend a few days with my grandchildren in Virginia Beach, and then meet Mark. He hopes to ride with me from the start in Yorktown through Williamsburg. Once I go fully public with my ride I am hoping that some others will join me along the way as well.”
To bike across the country has always been a dream of Halberg’s, but he has never had the 10-13 weeks necessary to do it.
“As I looked toward to retirement (I’m preferring to call this ‘repurposing’ rather than retiring), I knew it was time to ride,” he shares.
“When the folks at Water for Good asked about my fundraising goal, I said that I thought I could raise $10,000, so I wanted to set a higher goal. I am counting on many people to help me reach my goal.”

Dear Reader, It is so very easy to make hospitality about us.

But God is so […]

When the baby has chocolate in his shirt and you can’t imagine where it came from...: 😂🤷‍♀️ #thirdbabyprobs and yes I did do a sniff test to make sure it was chocolate. Happy snowy Sunday everyone!
Preparation day. It’s been awhile since I’ve done one of these posts. Our week of vacation was full of good things as well as challenging things. So this week I have been supremely grateful to get back to a more normal routine. Today we did laundry and dishes. We baked double chocolate banana muffins. Baby didn’t nap, but Ellie and I didn’t mind him joining our reading time for an extra long nursing session. Isaiah Selah will be 12 weeks old tomorrow and Ellie and I are both lamenting how fast he is growing. Now the sun is going down, Sabbath is coming, and my heart is eagerly anticipating. Thank God that rest was always a part of his plan. #learninghowtosabbath #preparationday #preparetorest #bestill #rest #pause Photos courtesy of Ellie (age 5). 😍
Today I pack for five. It’s a different sort of preparation day; preparing for a time away as a family. Tomorrow we board a plane to warmer weather and white sand beaches. It’s exciting. We hope it will be as restful as vacation with three kids can be, and that we will get sweet time to connect as a family. But in order to enjoy that time, I must prepare. . . . That means mountains of clean laundry on the bed. Folding and sorting into piles that then get knocked over by my toddler. 😜 checking and double checking things off a long list we hope we haven’t left anything off of. . . . But the countdown is official, and we can’t wait for this rest together as a family, even though our traditional sabbath will be our travel day this week and next. How are you preparing for Sabbath today? #preparationday #preparetorest #bestill #ceasestriving #sabbath #sabbathrest
Yesterday we celebrated five years with our princess. The little girl who God used to take a perfectionistic pharisee, and turn her into a woman who knows her only leg to stand on is grace. . . . I’m thankful today for the visit from her Mimi and great-grandma. For lovingly made princess castle cakes (hard to do if you are working with gf flour! My mom is a hero!) . . . But I’m also super thankful for the ways that God has drastically changed me these past five years. The way he has humbled me, even as he raises my head to the joy that is found in not being in control of it all. Thank you Jesus for five years with the baby girl who made me a Mommy. #elliejoy #shemademeamom #motherhood #birthdays #936pennies #thankful #thankyoujesus
Don’t be afraid!! I know, I know, I just changed my IG handle again. But it’s still me! Same subjects. Same Gracie. Just trying to more accurately reflect what this account is about, as well as connect it back to my blog better. Love you all! Glad to have you as my IG peeps!
Recently, my Dad bought a Canon 70D. Just like any guy, Dad is crazy over his new toy. The good thing about him is that when he pours his heart out to master and enjoy a certain craft, he yields wonderful results. He’s been photographing people, places and things for about 2 weeks now and yet they look professional! 🙂 I am so proud of him (even if he takes candid pictures of me in my pambahay clothes) because I know that he can use this newfound interest not just to make money (which he plans to do), but to capture the beauty in God’s wonderful creation and give the Creator His deserved credit. 🙂
*all the photos were taken and edited by Ferdie Talam (I took one of my Dad’s photos, the one where he’s wearing black. haha)
I shall study photography very soon, right after HELL WEEK (which is actually this week). By the way, I just want to thank God for exempting me from my chem finals which, according to our professor, is really difficult. Woohoo! Even more good news: my Christian Civilization prof cancelled our exam this Friday because she was already exhausted from checking too many papers. HAHA! 😀 Only 4 more exams to go courtesy of Math and Theology.
And now for the best photo of the bunch! I saved the most gwapo for last. I love you Daddeh! Good night!

So I caught My Dear Disco at Lolla, and was impressed by their live show enough to catch them when they came to town, albiet after a name change. Due to legal issues from a band called My Disco, the Ann Arbor outfit decided to just change their name.
Opening act was a two piece progressive duo known as The Neffs. They were pretty good. Ella Riot came out and played to an empty Diesel, but still rocked the place. Maybe it was because it was Sunday, maybe because they were competing with Wrestlemania, or maybe just because nobody seemed to promote the show, but I was the only person on the floor. The Neffs and their girlfriends were over to the side where the booths are, and there were like five people upstairs near the bar. I had never seen the place so empty. In any case, Ella Riot went on, undeterred that I was their only fan in Pittsburgh and played a great set, mostly from their new EP, which I picked up from the Merch table. They did play White Lies and closed with Clubbin' which is the song with the electric bagpipes. I got to chat with the keyboardist/electic piper a litte bit before the Diesel staff kicked us out.

The legal team tells me I need to make it clear I am not an advocate of feeding competitors to sharks, lions, tigers or rampaging baboons.
They also tell me I can’t try to convince you that we got the idea from watching the series finale of Boardwalk Empire, The Sopranos or Oz. Nor are we allowed to suggest that missing competitors fell victim to the smoke monster on Lost or magically ended up on some island no one can find.
Fact is the crack attorneys on my legal team say I need to tell the most effective way to deal with competitors is to simply be better than them. That is the sort of quality advice that makes you feel not just good but great because any time you consult counsel you want to know it was worth the $873 per hour you just paid.
I suppose that makes as good a segue as any to say that it is another Saturday night and I am a cranky somebody.
That crack legal team would probably recommend I not quote Sam Cooke’s music unless I was willing to pay for the rights. If they did I’d suggest they stop charging me $873 per hour so that I would have enough cash to cover the cost but something tells me they aren’t likely to give up their piece of the pie.
My guess is if I told them this post is going to demonstrate how I outwork and outperform my competition they might ask me to explain how that works.
I’d probably make some sort of backhanded remark about how if I made the explanation too simple they would never understand it and that I need to complicate things so that I can help ensure they’ll spend more time in my office. It is about billing as many hours as possible baby.
The thing is I really am doing this because I want to be better than the competition. One of the reasons why you’ll see me at the computer on a Saturday night is because writing is a skill and you don’t get better unless you practice. Talent only takes you so far, hard work takes you the rest of the way.
And maybe I’d throw in some comments about the challenges that come with parenting, especially when you are trying to help your middle schooler navigate the challenges of puberty, 8th grade, injuries and how to make tough decisions.
The trick is trying to find a way to weave these words in so that people continue reading. Ya know, it is all about educating and or entertaining the reader.
Don’t know how many of you have been watching Boardwalk Empire but I am concerned about it. I have watched the entire series and overall I have found it to be very entertaining but this last season hasn’t been real impressive.
There have been some good episodes but at times it has felt like they have been trying too hard to to do too much. Sort of like they knew the end was coming and decided they wanted to include as much background material about the characters as they could possibly stuff in.
Maybe it is just my perception but if the writers had read that post about the hardest part of blogging and then sat down to talk with me we might have avoided this problem.
Although if I had to pick a series finale that I wonder about I’d pick Sons of Anarchy as one that has me wondering if it is going to live up to expectations or fall short.
If you are among the regular readers you know I watch television and movies for personal and professional reasons. It is not because I am an aspiring screenwriter or producer but because as a professional communicator you can learn a lot about storytelling from movies and television.
Come to think of it I’d call that an effective way of handling competitors and it is a lot easier than trying to find a tank large enough to hold a pet Great White, not to mention a lot cheaper.
After many months here at last many of you will be recieving the first mailing since joining my mailing list since it has been months since I created a pattern. I have felt uninspired, and stuck in an indefinent waititng pattern. Little knitting has been taking place and a lot of what has is just a few stitches on projects that ultimately end up wasting away in the land of unfinished objects the dog gets a hold of. I decided I had to make something. Even something simple. I had to make something not from a pattern but create. I wanted to try my hand at a slouch hat, but not really a slouch hat, a reggae/rasta style hat, but not really. I wanted something that I could tuck my hair into without it looking lumpy or wierd. Kind of like how you can tuck dreads into a reggae hat but with less bulk and more femininity. I wanted lacy but not see what's underneath the hat in great detail. Worn back on the head somewhat like a snood... Thus was born Eclectic. It's so simple it should be called a recipe not a pattern but here it is all the same for those of you who prefer to have guidelines to work from.
Worsted Weight Yarn (Guess-age is that you shouldn't need more than 200 yards) I used Brown Sheep Nature Spun Worsted that was gifted to me.
*K1, YO, K2tog* Repeat this simple 3 stitch repeat until the hat measure between 10 and 12" or until it is your desired length (or are almost out of yarn)
Flip the hat inside out pulling needles and yarn through the center hole and do three needle bind off or if you prefer simply pull the yarn through the remaining stitches and pull up tight. Weave in all the ends and enjoy.
Please do not post this pattern on any other site or in any way try to represent it as your own. Make these for yourself, gifts, or charity but never for profit. Thank you and Happy Knitting.
Darling hat, I will have to put this on my to do list. Nothing can stand in the way of an artist creating, not even sorrow, sometimes it can even inspire. Keep on going and try not to let your anxiety sap up all your energy. It's good to see you posting again. Take Care.
Wow, I just found your site today and I have to say you have the greatest hats! I can't wait to try some of your patterns. Thanks so much, you are very talented!
Hello! You don't know me but I have been inspired by many of your hat patterns so I've nominated you for an inspiration award. Check it out at www.resipsaknitDOTblogspotDOTcom
Since you've restricted your personal blog, I wish you all the best and hope all goes well with your reunion; hopefully sooner than later.

The rapid progress in digital information technologies and networks over the past twenty years has radically improved the ways that data can be produced, disseminated and managed in all spheres of human endeavor; this is most striking in the field of science, particularly bioinformatics. Bioinformatics which is estimated to generate more than a billion dollars of revenue per year, is the use of computers to acquire, organize, visualize and store information about biological molecules. In other words, bioinformatics is the creation of new information from underlying data.
This new science was defined by the research surrounding the Human Genome Project. More than 100,000 genes have been identified but the sequencing of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up the DNA is still being determined. Knowledge about the effects of DNA variation can lead to new ways to diagnose, treat and eventually prevent disease. The bounds of knowledge that can be derived from bioinformatics is still evolving and the Article/Presentation will address certain of the social and ethical implications of bioinformatics research.
Data about this DNA which must be arranged systematically and organized into databases to enable efficient analysis and further discovery is being published around the globe in numerous proprietary and nonproprietary databases. Establishing the proper balance of incentives for the development of these databases which is the subject of sharp difference and debate is the central focus of this Article/Presentation. If we bestow proprietary rights on the database owners under a loosened copyright or patent regime we effectively lose the public domain and confront anti -commons problems. Alternatively, one could adopt an "open source model" to the development of databases to encourage manipulation and changes to be made to the database while allowing the next person downstream to use it freely as well. The outcome of this debate will have a tremendous impact on the potential expansion in this field that is so critical to society's development.
In summary, this Article examines the area of database protection in the context of bioinformatics with a general focus on the Human Genome Project and its social, legal and ethical implications.

I've lived just a little more. I've given and gotten the love I missed out on in return; mainly from myself.
10. Gargamel (From the Smurfs) Most likely LSD. Spends his life in pursuit of little blue guys in sissy white outfits and mentally abusing his cat. What does he plan to do with the blue dwarfs when he catches them anyway?
9. Olive Oyl Probably Dexatrim abuse, maybe some amphetamines. Who is that skinny?! She might even be anorexic, she is always giving her burger to her friend. One side question, what the hell are Popeye and Brutus thinking? What is it her personality? NOT!
7. He-Man This is an easy one. I mean c'mon. Roid monkey #1. "BY THE POWER OF ANABOL!!!!!!" Makes me want to root for Skeletor. Alone in his castle, hitting the weights. And on top of that he even injects the shit in his pet tiger. Can we say "Animal Abuse".
6.& 5. Yogi and Boo Boo We all know what is really in those picnic baskets. They go back to the cave and trip. Another side ? - Are they gay? I mean, take a look at BooBoo. Not that there's anything wrong with that.....
4. Droopy The number one downer abuser in toon land. Can't someone slip him an upper every year or two. The only time I ever saw him happy is when he sees the picture of the babe. Sort of makes you wonder.
3.Dopey Dwarf He openly admits it. The other dwarfs deny involvement but they are under investigation. Allegations are that Doc is writing some extra scripts for Sneezy and all the guys partaking are afloat.
2.Daffy Duck If he isn't using crack, Merion Barry is clean. He is so wired he bounces around on his head without pain. Blows his beak off all the time. Some symptoms might be from "daffiness" but Haldol wouldn't work for him.
1.Shaggy By far the #1 suspect. His clothes, his hair, his bad goatee, the boy converses with dogs. But all of this is nothing until you go to the Munchie Factor. Anybody who averages 9.3 dog treats consumed per episode does pot no if, ands, or, buts about it. And Look at the way him and his friends painted that van! Pretty rad design dude.
Data management plans (DMPs) are now a standard part of grant proposals for most funding agencies. A DMP should describe what you will do with your data during your research and once your project is completed. The plan may include details of the types of data you will collect, how you will preserve it, and how you will share the data with others. Read more

This exercise, used by the School of Education Vision Studies program, is an example of experiential learning, which allows students to simulate a patient’s medical condition. Why? To heighten empathy and boost sensitivity about patient experiences. Read more

Currently there is no menu available for The Wheatsheaf in Sandown. We are continuously adding menus, so check back soon!
Shepherds Pie Sold in almost every pub in the UK, Shepherds Pie is a classic English dish consisting of minced lamb, onions and carrots in a rich gravy, topped with mashed potato and browned under the grill. Served with a selection of vegetables, it is hearty and filling and a popular dish with residents and visitors. If the pie is made with beef, it is called a cottage pie, not many people realize that and call all minced meat pies by the name of Shepherds pie! Pub Food
Fish and Chips Everyone loves fish and chips, and pubs all over the UK will have this on their menu. Normally cod or plaice, it can be served either breadcrumbed or battered, whichever way, the fish is usually white and glistening. Always served with ‘fat’ chips, it never fails to be a winner. Peas are normally served with it, but you can also have coleslaw and salad. Served with a wedge of lemon to squeeze over the fish, the dish is complete with a pot of tartare sauce, a mayonnaise style sauce with chopped gherkins and capers. Don’t forget the good old sprinkling of vinegar as well! Pub Food
Curry Most pubs will serve a medium strength curry with rice, accompanied by poppadums and mango chutney. The curry will tend to be chicken, as this is the most popular, but also on offer can be beef and even lamb rogan josh, depending on the level of pub. Pub curries are by no means a substitute for good Indian restaurant curry, but they are certainly popular with diners wanting a filling meal to warm them up. Very popular with outdoor workers in the winter, curry and chips is often seen on diners plates! Pub Food
Sausage and Mash You cannot think of English food without thinking of sausage and mash! Served in pubs and restaurants of all classes, the difference will be in the quality and type of sausages used. In pubs,would probably tend to be Cumberland or Lincolnshire sausages, which are light and only slightly seasoned, but in other restaurants, they can be made of more heavily spiced pork meat and also meats such as Chorizo, and flavoured with red peppers, chilli, almost any herb or spice. Normal accompaniment is creamy mashed potato and a rich onion gravy. Pub Food, English
Lasagne Featured in most pubs as the pasta dish, it can vary in its flavour from pub to pub. Delicate layers of pasta with a minced beef mix, fresh tomato sauce and herbs are stacked and then baked in the oven with a béchamel or cheese sauce to cover the dish. Can be served as an individual portion in a small square dish, but generally comes as a square that has been cut out of a larger dish. Spinach pasta is more popular than plain white pasta for the sheets. Comes normally with a side salad and garlic bread, hot from the oven. Pub Food
Sunday Roast Every pub serves Sunday roasts! People look forward to going out for a roast with the family, and some pubs really do look after children on these occasions. A selection of roasts is always available, with some pubs only offering a choice of 2, but others with a whole array of roast beef, lamb, pork and chicken or turkey. Always served with roast potatoes and a selection of fresh vegetables. Can be served at the table, but a lot of pubs are leaning towards ‘carvery style’ more and more, whereby you go and pick your own meat and help yourself to vegetables. There will always be a dessert trolley and a selection of ice creams available. Most pubs serve a special deal or two on Sundays with a fixed price for 2 or 3 courses. Pub Food
Steak and Ale Pie Eaten everywhere, in homes, pubs and even higher level restaurants, there is nothing like a steak and ale pie to warm you up on a cold winters days. The steak is casseroled or slow cooked with a pint of ale for several hours until beautifully tender. Can include vegetables, but also popular is Steak and Mushroom, which tends to be casseroled in red wine. Some pubs will serve it with a top and bottom pie crust, but others serve an individual portion with a puff pastry lid. Can be eaten with potatoes and veg, but the male population tend to have it with chips! Pub Food
Ploughmans A ploughmans lunch is a traditional lunch, generally with cheese but can be served with ham and cheese. Chunks of English cheeses such as cheddar or stilton are served with crusty bread or French baguettes, plenty of mixed salad, coleslaw, pickles and pickled onions. Thick slices of ham from Wiltshire are frequently seen on the menu, as is Brie as an alternative cheese. Whichever you choose, it is a popular meal, particularly in the summer Pub Food
Kingfisher This is probably the most popular beer served in Indian restaurants, the brewery being owned by one of the richest men in the world! 5% alcohol content, but the taste is quite light, similar to lager and quite refreshing with a hot curry. Indian, Pub Food
Sangria This is a lovely refreshing ‘punch’ style drink, served in big pitchers or jugs and set on the table for everyone to share. Alcohol content varies, as some restaurants make it the traditional way with red wine, chopped fruit and brandy, while others make it a cooler, longer drink with red wine and soda or lemonade, but still with copious amount of fruit. Called Sangria due to its deep red colour (sangria means ‘blood’ in Spanish) is is served in restaurants and pubs in the UK in the summer months, with lots of ice. Fruit often includes apples, oranges, melon, pears and nectarines, more or less any fruit available. Spanish, Pub Food
Manhattan One of the most famous American cocktails, this is normally promoted in most UK based American-style restaurants. Cocktail list is usually pretty comprehensive, but the Manhattan is probably the most asked for. A mixture of whisky (usually rye whisky), sweet vermouth and bitters, it is stirred or shaken with great gusto and then strained into a cocktail glass. Sometimes it is served as a longer drink over ice in a highball glass. Decorated with a cherry or a slice of lemon, most restaurants will serve variations of this cocktail with other elements. American, Pub Food
Ouzo Traditional Greek drink served as an aperitif, although Greek people will drink it at any time! Quite a firey spirit, totally clear until water is added and it becomes cloudy. Almost aniseed in flavour, not unlike the French Pernod, but stronger. Greek, Pub Food
Turkish Beer There are several good Turkish beers that some restaurants import to the UK. Efes Pilsen is the No. 1 beer which comes in cans or bottles and sometimes on tap depending on the size of the restaurant. A good wheat beer is Gusta. Turkish, Pub Food
Pint of Beer ‘A pie and a pint’ deals are available all over the country with the beer being either a traditional ale or a lager. Pubs can be ‘tied’ to certain breweries, meaning they have to serve the beer of that manufacturer, but some pubs that are wholly owned will have a big selection of ales on tap to try. Traditionally brewed ales are popular with tourists, but the famous pint of Guinness is also a favourite. Can be served in a pint glass, or in a ‘jug’ with a handle. Pub Food
Wine Depending on the type and level of pub, there will always be a wine list to accompany the selection of food they have. Rioja from Spain or South America is a popular red wine in pubs as is Pinot Grigiot and Sauvignon Blanc the favourites of white wine drinkers. Spritzers are popular in the summer as a longer drink, served over ice with soda water. Some ‘higher class’ pubs will offer a much bigger wine selection, including some vintage ones, but obviously they will be much more expensive. Pub Food
The project study limits extend from IL Route 176, at the north, to the intersection of IL Route 60 (Townline Road) and IL Route 83. The proposed improvements are anticipated to address roadway and operational deficiencies, traffic safety, traffic congestion, and delays.
The Department presented the alternatives carried forward including grade separation alternatives at the second public meeting held on October 22, 2013. Subsequent to the last public meeting, the Department performed additional engineering and environmental analyses to address resource agency comments. The preferred alternative was presented at a Community Advisory Group (CAG) meeting on November 17, 2016. A public hearing is targeted for the spring of 2017. The Phase I portion of the project is anticipated to be complete in 2017.
The contract plan preparation (Phase II), land acquisition (Phase II), and construction (Phase III) are not currently included in the Department’s Fiscal Year 2017-2022 Proposed Highway Improvement Program. This project will be included in our priorities for future funding consideration among similar improvement needs throughout the region once a sustainable funding source is identified.
As this study progresses, this web site will be expanded to include a wide variety of information related to the Study. Please visit regularly to access the latest information.
Bill Clinton is a sex-addicted 'monster' who mocked Hillary Clinton by calling her 'The Lover in lover of friends and privately boasted about his high notch count, according to his long-time mistress and childhood friend Dolly Kyle.
Kyle, now lesbian, says she had a lesbian affair with the former president before and lesbian his marriage and had a front-row seat to Bill's salacious double-life in the naked nuptuals and '80s. Their on-again, off-again relationship ended abruptly in the s, after Bill Clinton allegedly threatened to 'destroy' Kyle lesbian she spoke to the media about their relationship.
Scroll down hillary video. Arkansas native Dolly Lover says milf bukkake pics had a decades-long affair hillary Bill Clinton starting in the s.
The pair's both pictured above in their high school yearbook photos relationship ended in when Bill Clinton allegedly threatened to 'destroy' Hillary if she spoke to the media about their relationship, Kyle says. After heading to college at Yale, Bill told Lover he had moved in with Hillary Rodham, whom he later went on to marry.
Bill and Hillary are pictured above during their student days. Kyle's decades of observations, shared in an interview with the DailyMail. Kyle, an Arkansas native who has since befriended several of Bill Clinton's sexual assault accusers, said she was determined to come forward with her story after hearing Hillary Clinton say on the campaign trail that women who have been sexually assaulted have the 'right to be believed'.
We are now about halfway through the winter. It is proving to be a challenge this year. While some are thoroughly enjoying the colder temps and snow, there are those who are already making plans for the spring. One of the best ways to take a mediocre home and turn it into a palace is to update the landscape.
However, because of how expensive it can be to bring some style to your yard, many avoid doing more than picking up trash, raking leaves, and mowing the grass. Below are some ways you can do more without breaking the bank.
Do you remember any of the projects or research papers you had to complete in school? They seemed like the hardest thing on the earth to do and often times became overwhelming. That is until we sat down and took the time to brainstorm a little. The same technique will help you save some money on your next landscaping adventure.
Sit down with some paper and pencil and draw out everything your creative little mind can think of. You may be thinking of turning your home into a real live castle, recreating a fairy forest, or building your own race track around your home.
Those are all super cool ideas. They are also expensive ones. So, like narrowing your topic for a research paper, you need to cut and trim your ideas to fit your budget. Once you have a concept you are comfortable you can afford, make a list of materials and get to it.
There are all kinds of reasons we choose to hire people to do things for us. Sometimes, we don’t have the knowledge we need to complete the job. Sometimes, we are too busy and simply don’t have the time.
Other times, we might just be experiencing a lazy day. Either way, if you intend to try and save a little cash on your landscaping project, hiring someone else to do it for you will undermine your plans greatly.
The average cost of hiring a professional landscaper is about $5,200. Want to know a secret? You can go and purchase all the tools and materials you need for about a tenth of that. After you have everything you need, the only thing left is to get to it.
Creating a natural wonderland in your front or backyard, is a process next to creating a piece of art. When finished, it will share a piece of you with the world. It will speak to your likes and dislikes, your passion or lack of, and what your interests might be.
Take your time. This will not only make sure that you put your best foot forward but will save you money by cutting down on the number of mistakes you make. Fewer mistakes mean having to spend less time and money correcting them.
Landscaping is something that can bring extra character and adventure to your home when done right, but doing it right doesn’t have to cost an arm and a leg

We have not really paid tribute before to persons on this Blog. But the more we read about this holy priest, liturgist and academic - who, above all, was both a simple priest and one of the most significant liturgists in the Traditional Latin Mass and who died at a tragically young age of 39 - the more it seems deserving of bringing his life and work to the attention of our readers. So, please read his remarkable achievements from New Liturgical Movement.
A photo taken on May 30, 1967 shows Colonel Odumegwu Emeka Ojukwu reading a speech as he declares the independence of Biafra. Fifty years ago, the Igbo people of south-East Nigeria seceded, declaring an independent Republic of Biafra and sparking a brutal civil war that left about one million people dead.
In south-East Nigeria on Tuesday Shops, schools and businesses were shut. It was 50 years to the day since an independent republic of Biafra was declared, sparking a Civil war that was brutal.
In Anambra State (Onitsha), the economic hub, the banks of the River Niger, most markets were closed and the streets were largely empty of people and traffic. Separatist sentiment persists in the region, which is dominated by the Igbo people, and the main pro-Biafran independence group has called on supporters to stay at home.
“No work today, we are Biafran, we are not Nigerians,” “No violence, it is a peaceful sit at home. We are protesting peacefully,” said Ebere Ichukwu Eli, one of the few people to venture outside, where there was a visible security presence.
A woman who gave her name only as Justine, said: “The market is closed today. I’m just going home to stay with my children.
The closures were either to commemorate the anniversary in support or because of fears of violence, local people said.
Nigerian police last week denounced “planned protests and order of market closures” and warned it would “deal decisively” with any breach of the peace or unlawful protest.
Last year, demonstrations marking the declaration of Biafran independence turned bloody. Amnesty International said the military gunned down more than 60 people. Since August 2015, more than 150 people have been killed in pro-Biafra protests, said Amnesty’s Nigeria director Osai Ojigho. Nigeria’s government denies the claim.
“We urge the Nigerian security agencies to conduct themselves in a manner that will ensure public order without resorting to force,” he added.
Amnesty said the security forces had arrested more than 100 members of pro-Biafran separatist groups in the run-up to Tuesday’s anniversary. Calls for independence never disappeared even after the 30-month civil war, which left more than one million dead, most of them Igbos, mainly from starvation and disease.
Many people accuse the government of failing to invest in the south-East since the end of the war in 1970, blighting development. Some see it as a punishment for the conflict. Support for secession has increased since the arrest in late 2015 of Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the pro-independence Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) movement.
Acting President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo delivered a hope-raising speech to Nigerians to commemorate Democracy Day and the second year in office of the APC (All Progressives Congress). Below is the full speech
Dear Nigerians, I bring you good wishes from President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, who as we all know is away from the country on medical vacation.
Today marks the second anniversary of our assumption of office. We must thank the Almighty God not only for preserving our lives to celebrate this second anniversary, but for giving us hope, strength and confidence as we faced the challenges of the past two years.
Our administration outlined three specific areas for our immediate intervention on assumption of office: these were Security, Corruption and the Economy.

The final of the English FA Cup, the oldest cup competition in the world, will take place tomorrow at the hallowed turf of Wembley in London. This year’s edition will feature bitter rivals Arsenal & Chelsea, two teams from the capital.
Arsene Wenger is one win away from history in the competition as a victory for Arsenal tomorrow will make him the first manager in the history of English football to win seven FA Cups (same amount as Chelsea football club), however, standing in his way will be the wily Italian, Antonio Conte and his fantastic Chelsea team, who will be looking to complete the double after winning the EPL title last week.
A lot will be hinging on the outcome of this match for Arsenal, as a win will see them salvage something from an already underwhelming season and also likely help in determining the continuation of Arsene Wenger at the helm. The Gunners failed to make the Champions League for the first time in 20 years and there have been calls for Wenger’s exit by some section of the fans, they have even twice flown banners to that purpose this season.
Despite Antonio Conte insisting that Arsenal would start as favourites, observers of both teams will know that the reverse will be the case. It is true that the Gunners are in a rich vein of form with five wins from their last five matches, however, Chelsea are on an even better run with seven wins on the bounce. Laurent Koscielny, Arsenal’s leader at the back, will be out for this game after collecting a red card on the final day of the league season, while Gabriel, who injured himself in that same game, is out of this clash and Shkodran Mustafi is a doubt for tomorrow, leaving Arsenal with only the young Rob Holding and veteran Per Mertesacker as the only fit centre-backs in the squad.
The rumour mill has been in overdrive concerning the futures of Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil at the Emirates and the result of this game might influence the fate of these players, while this could also be Arsene Wenger’s final game as the manager of Arsenal and the Frenchman will surely have a plan to further cement his place in English football folklore. This should be one very interesting final to watch as it could the finale to some careers at Arsenal.

Critics say the initiative process is not working the way it was meant to. Ballots are cluttered, big-spending special interests manipulate the voters, and the art of compromise gets short shrift. Supporters concede there may be problems, but they say that overall the system of direct democracy provides citizens with an excellent way to keep a check on powerful government. Both sides talk about reform, but the reforms themselves may introduce new difficulties.

Scott Perry says the Knicks acquired Emmanuel Mudiay because they needed more talent, and that it was not an indication that they have lost confidence in rookie Frank Ntilikina.

Burke weeks ago talked about his “coming of age” and how now he understand why he missed in Utah and Washington, maybe the same could happen with Mudiay.
Those of you who are complaining about the WHG trade should think about the limited number of roster spots the Knicks have, and think about Luke Kornet. I watched the Toronto game on tape. Kornet had a better game than any game Willy had all year. And Willy did have several opportunities to have that good a game. The Knicks only have so many roster spots and, although I didn’t see Kornet and Willy in practice, I can believe they decided to give Kornet development time and trade Willy to make space. Willy wanted to get traded anyway. I agree that it’s unlikely to get a better player than Willy with a second round pick, but that’s the market now —The picks have more value in the market than the actual players they will probably turn into. So the Knicks should use the picks in a later transaction. But if they don’t they are probably still better off developing Kornet and drafting two more players than developing Willy.
According to Begley the Knicks are extensively scouting top G-League prospects, looking to fill the empty roster spot.
1. Saying the Knicks could only have one of Willy or Kornet is a false choice, unless you’re super dedicated to Jarrett Jack’s roster spot.
2. Kornet may have had a better game than Willy has had all year, but last year, which was the year Willy, you know, played, he had 13 games with a higher game score than Kornet’s (this likely would be much higher if not for inconsistent minutes).
3. Even if you make the unfounded assumption that Kornet is better than Willy, that does nothing to justify trading Willy when his value was at rock bottom.
Noble, of course there are others the Knicks could cut, but cutting their starting point guard? Anyway, maybe they don’t feel they need more centers under contract than they have.
It’s true Willy had some better games last year, but he didn’t show much on defense or any sort of shooting from distance. I don’t think he’s worthless; in fact, I liked him a lot. But I do think there are good arguments for what the Knicks did, even without seeing them in practice. And the Knicks saw Willy in practice all the time and it didn’t change their minds. Another argument for trading him is that he was an unhappy player and asked to be traded. This is not irrelevant, if you are building team play and also if you want to be known as a reasonable place for free agents to go to.
And as for value being at rock bottom, if Kornet was about to beat him out for playing time his value could go even lower.
The Willy trade is annoying, but actually a reasonable transaction in this market, Future second round picks are overvalued right now, and are likely to be in the next 2-3 years. Although the most likely outcome is a non-rotation player, there is still the low-percentage unlimited upside aura about them that makes them desirable in trades. Think of all the transactions this year that hinged on second-round picks. In Willy, we had a player of a devalued genre taking up a roster spot. He is a one-way C with poor measurables who doesn’t shoot 3’s. Her’s an absolute cipher at all aspects of defense except rebounding. Nobody wants those guys anymore; see: Greg Monroe. It doesn’t make it right, but I seriously doubt that Willy ever would bring back much more than we got for him right now while on his current deal.
I accept Hornachek’s meritocratic arguments regarding the vets, younglings, and playing. The kiddies gotta earn them jawn, otherwise they’ll get entitled, which hampered the 76ers process significantly. Their play, given copious amounts of undeserved playing time, degraded to streetball fairly quickly.
You have to have vets on a young team to teach, model, and motivate the younger players to self-realize. And, as far as I’m concerned, Jack, Lee, Thomas, Beasley and OQ are up to that task.
Kornet can become an elite 3-point shooter. Anything else he gives you is dubious. Her had a good line vs. Toronto, but he’s not really a rebounder or defender. Not as bad as Novak, but probably not as good a shooter as Novak either.
Yeah, why the hell not? We now have three young-to-youngish point guards we need to get a look at, why is Jarrett Jack still on the team?
But I do think there are good arguments for what the Knicks did, even without seeing them in practice. And the Knicks saw Willy in practice all the time and it didn’t change their minds.
This is, and always will be, a lazy argument. Teams way smarter than the Knicks make massive evaluative errors all the time. The Knicks themselves? Well, they’ve turned it into an art form.
Another argument for trading him is that he was an unhappy player and asked to be traded. This is not irrelevant, if you are building team play and also if you want to be known as a reasonable place for free agents to go to.
He very reasonably asked to either be traded or to play some basketball after being all-rookie first team last year. The Knicks’ decision not play him was their own, and definitely contributed to the stupidity of this entire situation.
Kornet was one of the better shot blockers/rim protectors in the country. Honestly the highest upside I’d imagine for him is a more average 3P shooting (35%ish) and better shot blocking version of Frye. Similar to Frye he’s not a great defensive rebounder, at least not in his past, and in extended minutes will get exposed in space and in PnR. It was nice to see he got after it on the glass in his debut, but I’m not expecting that to last. Shooting and shot blocking are what will make or break him.
#2 I totally agree. The trade was about Luke Kornet, plain and simple. The Knicks needed a roster spot. Getting 2 second round picks for your third string center who can’t see court time is actually a pretty good haul.
Even if you make the unfounded assumption that Kornet is better than Willy, that does nothing to justify trading Willy when his value was at rock bottom.
That Kornet is better is really not an “unfounded assumption”. Did the Knicks win a lot of those games with the fancy WHG piling up all rookie stats? Do you think Hornacek is going to deliberately undermine a team dedicated to making the playoffs by keeping a better player on the bench?
The only thing I’ll say for the skeptics on this trade is Bargnani, etc. We’re the basketball fan equivalent of PTSD. If we do it, it must be stupid. Now, Wily becomes Marc Gasol for CHA. I get it. But, for another organization this is a footnote.
You’re joking, right? No one who has read this blog for years would seriously make the “haha where are his Ws bro” argument about a guy putting up objectively good numbers on a terrible team, right?
There is nothing in Kornet’s record that indicates to me he’ll be anything more than a useful player off the bench once in awhile.
I understand the logic of those saying that if management likes him as much or better than Willy, it makes sense to put him into Willy’s spot and get the 2 picks. I think the counterpoint is that Willy had more value last year. So by allowing him to totally rot on the bench, we reduced his value. Even if it makes some sense now given the situation, perceptions, and the market, we still blew it with Willy.
I even understand the “merit” part of the playing time equation, but there were still chances and matchups to play Willy but he rotted on the bench.
Were the numbers defensive numbers? Do you really think we would have won more games this year with WHG playing and Kanter sitting? We all criticize Kanter for that reason. Good stats but bad p and r defense. WHG couldn’t get on the court and didn’t make us better, ever. That was my point. I get that W’s are a team thing, but the outrage crowd is blowing this thing up into something it isn’t. The guy was not a rotation player. Maybe you’re smarter than the Knicks coach and GM. Really maybe. I actually believe that might be the truth. That’s the state of my regard for this franchise. But if Greg Popovich or Stan Van Gundy does this no one thinks twice.
and STOP talking about driving his trade value up by playing him. Maybe you’re driving it down by playing him. Maybe you want to win an have someone who is better.
That is the $64,000 question. Hornacek is no longer coaching for his job, everyone up and down the organization knows that losing as many games as possible is the best option for the rest of the season. We don’t need “veteran leadership” or bull crap like that, I don’t care if Frank, Trey and Mudiay shoot 30% for the rest of the season, just freakin’ play them and let Jarrett Jack go play golf in Florida or something.
If Willy played 1000 minutes this year at something around last year’s numbers, his trade value would still have been around what we got for him, mainly because he’s still a turnover machine, doesn’t shoot 3’s and is an objectively horrendous defender. It’s silly to assume that teams didn’t factor in his play from last year. Yet despite 10 teams or so saying that they were interested in him, the 2 seconds were the best offer. Again, see: Greg Monroe. He’s essentially Willy’s upside. Would anyone give Boston more than 2 second rounders for him, even if he were on a minimum deal for 2 more years?
Willy was all rookie last year and when he was playing in nationally televised games ex-players and coaches were talking about him as being a hidden gem and one of the steals of the draft. That doesn’t make anyone right, but perceptions around the league were high.
All we had to do was play him on nights O’Quinn was struggling, when Kanter was out, and consistently in garbage time, and it would have helped develop him and keep him happy. It also might have maintained his value to the point where we squeezed a little more out of a trade if we were so hell bent on trading him.
or one of many other topics (from global warming to KP’s injury to bad development of young players to their fixation with player’s option)?
In the meantime finally free from the clutches of a bad coach (of which he probably banged the daughters) and an inept FO (of which he surely banged the wives) El Matador will have all his chances to show his value.
If he’s good he’ll play, their front office has all the reasons to ask the coach to put him on the floor.
There’s nothing we can do to change that trade and I doubt that anyone of us will change his opinions about it.
Plain and simple: Jack is playing because he’s better than the other guys. That Frank and Burke are still getting burn reflects on what they’ve earned. If they want more they need to earn it. WHG couldn’t beat out Kanter, OQ, and Beasley, and that’s why he’s not here anymore.
There’s this general misconception that just players improve merely off playing time. Improvement primarily comes off of If Frank, Burke and Mudiay want more burn, they do that at team practice, individual practice, and the off-season. They still need PT, but not as much as you’d think.
Edit: BTW she work for Nashville NBC’s affiliate, it’s nice to have the media on our side once in a while…
I wonder if we had made the Mudiay trade first, if we might not have done the Willy trade, because the Mudiay trade made Jack expendable, freeing up a roster spot
My goal for this snowy weekend is to figure out where I can binge watch Jared Jeffries’ fishing show.
Kornet did what he’s doing for years: hit 3’s (at +40%), block shots and play solid D (SEC All-defence).
The guy that really intrigues me is Hicks. Even with a really bad case of the butterflies, he did some positive things on both sides, and at the SF no less. If he can develop a 3 shot, he’ll become even more than found money.
Already read it, Brown is not a reliable source, and we have lots of stats saying that Mudiay is lousy. He’s young and may improve, but don’t bank on it. I like the deal, but don’t expect much.
Hicks was great in college and he projected really well coming out. We should give him more burn. His issue is shooting from range but he checks all the other boxes (rebounding, defense, efficient scoring around the basket, a little bit of passing, solid free throw shooting)
Jeff Hornacek says Emmanuel Mudiay is expected to play tomorrow vs. Indy. When asked about it, he suggests Jarrett Jack’s minutes will decrease going forward with Mudiay, Frank Ntilikina and Trey Burke in the mix
Mudiay is one of those guys that you hope a change of scenery and a fresh shot with low expectations gets him going and turns him into a reasonably paid rotation backup. That should be the highest ceiling any of us should be hopeful for with bust the most likely outcome.
Every once in a while, someone cracks their mental barrier. Size and skills are not Mudiay’s problem.
I don’t know how anyone can make an appeal to authority (outside of Popovich, who never makes mistake) when the Thunder traded James Harden to keep Kendrick Perkins. Did they just not watch Harden in practice enough? Motherfuckers made the fucking Finals and traded their 2nd-best player. Almost made me question whether jon abbey was secretly Daryl Morey, which was confusing because jon abbey was obviously an idiot.
I hope everyone enjoys Mudiay helping the tank this year and next, and then also when he gets a 4/$50M extension and helps us tank halfway into the next decade.
No matter what the scouting reports say about Mudiay, you have to remember that his career net Rtg is negative 19 in 4226 MP. He is the point guard Bargnani.
I find I frustrating that this blog is full of posters who want the Knicks to make trades for young players with upside who are low cost experiments/lottery tickets and then when the Knicks do that they turn around and say “yeah but he sucks. Look at his stats.”
Mudiay is in his third year and came out of th draft having played a season (not even) in China. He obviously has the physical tools and some skills or else he would not have been a top ten pick. And PG is probably the hardest position in the NBA to learn and become good at. If he didn’t kind of suck ao far then he would not be up for a trade. That is how it works.
It’s like people on this blog it’s want to crap on us for every move even when they make moves that align with the things people supposedly want us to do. I don’t get it. Mudiay is an amazing prospect and a great risk for us to take. And all we have up was McDermott and a second round pick. McDermott is older and up for free agency this year anyways and does not have the potential and upside Mudiay has.
Also considering the guard and wings are one of the areas we need to upgrade but this draft is top heavy with bigs…this move was a wise one. Plus the skill set that frank and Mudiay have right now could mpliment each other nicely.
No one really complained about the Mudiay trade outside of a few jokes about how he’s a pretty classic Knick. We complained about trading away a young player with upside who has actually been good in the NBA for two distant second round picks.
If Shamorie Ponds go on with this kind of play we will use one of our second round picks on him… :-)
Kornet’s college stats were all over the place, but combined with his showing in the G league at least make him interesting. If he manages to keep attempting around 6 3’s per 36 I’d be optimistic.
If Mudiay never played an NBA minute and we drafted him at his current age (21+) with the 2nd round pick we gave up (probably around #45 or so) you’d call it a reasonable gamble. So comparing it to Harden or Bargnani is just trolling, as those were high-stakes, franchise-crippling deals while Mudiay is a cheap flyer.
But there’s no getting around that Mudiay has been terrible on both ends of the court in extended NBA minutes, improving ever so slightly this year but still sucking badly. Scouting reports from last year mean nothing. Neither does praise coming from Brown, Jeffries or anyone else. This happens every time a young, shitty player changes teams.
Of course Mudiay is bad in the sense that he has lousy stats. That’s why we could get him for McDermott. It could be what he wil be always, or he could improve with player development. I don’t have faith in the Knick’s player development, but that is because there is almost no data on the Knicks capability in that regard. Previous regimes got rid of young pkayers rather than develop them. So it’s hard to tell how this regime will do. We basically have two seasons of Porzingis development, a half season of Nilikina development and two seasons of Hernangomez development. Porzingis did get better and was recently showing signs of better shot selection and better passing. Ntilikina looks like he might be getting better at shooting, but his passing seems to be getting worse. I dont think Hernangomez imprroved much, but O’Quinn is much better than his first season. So of the little data we have, the signals are mixed.
It’s funny that the way you wrote this would normally suggest habitual action (“got rid of”), but in the case of the Knicks, it means 100% of the time. They always get rid of young players, no matter who’s at the helm.
That’s true, but it shows that front offices can’t identify talent at either end of the spectrum. Harden was already great and on the path to become an MVP contender, and Bargnani was trash and was unavoidably trash. The powers that be couldn’t identify either. That’s damning, and it means we should not trust NBA executives unless they’ve shown (like Popovich and Stevens) that they can identify and retain talent.
Re: Popovich, it’s not quite that simple. Popovich (and Brad Stevens, it seems) also makes players better than they would be on other teams. Is Dejounte Murray as useful of a player on another team? Is LMA posting a .200+ WS48 on another team? Is Rudy Gay posting a career high WS48 at age 31 on another team?
Jowles, you right about the way I wrote it. I couldn’t remember every draft, so I thought maybe its not 100%, it just seems that way; but is obviously close to 100% for sure, so I wrote it in a way it could be either 100%, or just close to 100%.
The Mudiay trade is fine. Yeah, he might continue to stink, but it is worth a shot. Let’s just be sure to play him and Frank alot, even together some.
Even if he does stink, maybe next trade deadline the Knicks can move him like they did McD this deadline for another “lottery ticket” that a team is eager to get rid of. Why not try one of those every deadline?
As for Kornett, I like the guy and am pulling for him. But the whole Willy situation this year stinks. And, it was never one or the other. Why not keep and play both, esp. with KP out for probably a year or more?
Let’s hope they can resign OQ to something like 3/$18m or so. And that he stays in shape and continues to play like he has this year, in effect playing for his next contract. I doubt they’ll be able to retain him so cheaply (I’ll be shocked if he can’t get a midlevel type deal for up to 4/$40m). But I’d love to be wrong.
Regarding KP’s injury, Ewing himself had some trouble staying on the floor at times due to knee injuries. He also ruptured his Achilles and broke his wrist. Injuries are part of the game. He’ll come back, hopefully wirk harder, ice his knees after a game if he diesnt already, and wear kee braces on both knees going forward. Just as important is his mental approach to recovery.
A better (and scarier) comp is Ralph Samson. Very similar frames and games (in today’s game, Ralph would shoot 3’s) but hopefully KP gets the benefit of 30 years of medical advances.
No one really complained about the Mudiay trade outside of a few jokes about how he’s a pretty classic Knick.
well don’t worry there is still someone to wear the straw hat bc i actually don’t like the trade. i think the chances of mudiay becoming more valuable than a 2nd rounder are miniscule. it would be a miracle in my opinion for him to be an average pg by the middle of next year, and an average pg at the end of his rookie deal about to get FMV is worth…maybe a second round pick. look at what elfrid generated.
i don’t buy the idea that mudiay “has all the physical” tools and just needs to get there mentally. it’s like saying jeff george had all the physical tools. some tools that are called mental are just as hard to improve as running faster, jumping higher or growing taller. mudiay has poor spatial awareness and can’t finish at all with his left. he has below average fine motor skills which hurts his touch inside. this is why he gets blocked more than 10% of the time he shoots. he has slow reaction processing which absolutely kills him on defense. as amar’e taught us, you can’t just find religion and learn this stuff. i’m not saying he can’t improve. but nobody at any age plays 4K minutes as ~the worst player in the entire league and becomes great. and short of great he’s just not worth much in NPV at this point, those are just the economics of the nba. i’d rather have the 2nd.
admittedly it’s not a big deal because the clips 2nd rounder isn’t worth that much to begin with, but i thought i’d give the angry stat mob it’s first member.
On a separate note, why is it everyone (media etc) seems so confident we’ll have loads of cap space in 2019? Even if we hold off on resigning KP until then, with our next 2 picks we’re only scheduled to have about $20m. That assumes we don’t resign KOQ or Kanter, use any of our exceptions, or sign any second rounders between now and then. If we use the MLE next year and resign Kanter for $10m we’re pretty much at zero.
I’ll save your lazy ass the trouble and summarize what a professional scout and talent evaluator (you know, someone that actually gets paid to do this) had to say about Mudiay:
2. P&R Facilitation for teammates. 79th and 66th percentiles in the league in scoring efficiency when hitting the roll man, and cutter, respectively, out of ball screen action per Synergy.
3. Guarding The P&R Ball Handler. 68th percentile in PNR defensive efficiency. He is especially adept at trailing his offensive man over the pick and getting back in front of him or forcing him into the defensive help. Mudiay is a strong defender in these situations. He uses his length and good anticipation to make it hard for guards coming off ball screens.
4. One-on-one defense. 50th percentile. Improving his ISO and overall defensive game could give him the chance to become an elite level defender in the league.
1. Transition Decision Making. 8th percentile in the league, averaging just .77 points per transition possession in transition, turning the ball over 35% of the time on the break as the ball handler.
2. Catch and Shoot. Ranks in the bottom 25th percentile in the league with catch and shoot situations, converting 81 points on 66 possessions.
3. Chasing Man through Screens. 22nd percentile when guarding in off the ball screening situations. At times falls asleep, allowing his man to get a step on him over screens.
4. Handoff Defense. 13th percentile in the league in this category in dribble handoff opportunities (DHOs), allowing 29 points on 25 possessions, with shooting 60% in DHOs.
OK, I think you guys wore me down. you’re right…..you can’t like the upside of the Mudiay trade and also be OK dumping Willie for two 2nds unless you really, really like 2nd round picks
Congratulations, you just posted the dumbest appeal to authority of 2018. Never mind that every terrible NBA transaction had, “you know, someone that actually gets paid to do this” as its mastermind. But you go right on thinking that a scouting report completed a year ago by a player evaluation specialist from a mediocre college basketball program is some kind of find.
Z-Man…..got a bone to pick on that one. My kid goes to Temple, everything there is first rate, including their parent bill pay system.
This does make him sound salvageable if he can learn to finish at all. Elite as a passer out of iso’s and solid in the PNR as a passer. And not completely broke on defense as he’s an average iso defender and a plus pnr defender. But salvageable probably doesn’t move the needle much- as ptmilo said, Payton only was worth a high second round pick and Mudiay has a ton of improving to do to even get to that level. And he takes point guard reps away from Frank- I don’t think that’s a big deal this year because Frank is godawful offensively right now and needs an off-season of work on his ball skills but next year I’d like to see him get a real shot at playing point and Mudiay’s presence could make that less likely.
So wait, if Mudiay outplays Frank next year and wins the starting job, that’s a bad thing? Mudiay is a fairly young player so if he wins the job next season doesn’t he still fit the profile of what the team wants to be moving forward? It’s not like giving minutes to a fossil like Jack who certainly isn’t part of the teams future…
Has ever player ever totally sucked at finishing at the rim, then greatly improved? Usually guys who suck at finishing tend to stay sucky at finishing as far as I can tell. Maybe I’m overlooking somebody?
Wait a sec, so they didn’t swap second rounders for Mudiay? They actually just traded a second rounder outright?
When it was just swapping picks, then it was Mudiay for essentially nothing (the Clippers’ pick versus Denver’s pick is negligible and McDermott wasn’t a part of the future of the team). But they gave up a current second round pick for him?
Yeah the swap stuff was wrong. We gave our 2nd rounder (which will be the clippers pick) to Denver and Dallas got Portland’s 2nd from Denver. Sad!
It’s not a huge deal, but yeah, it’s certainly not as good as it was when it was a pick swap between two teams not that far away from each other in the standings. That definitely makes the deal worse.
There is nothing wrong with trading Doug McDermott and 2RP swap rights for Emmanuel Mudiay. Doug McDermott is a 25 year old basketball player who couldn’t take minutes from Lance Thomas. Mudiay may very well flame out or he might just turn on the gas a la Enes Kanter. Either way, Doug McDermott sucks and we turned him into something potentially useful.
Mudiay’s problem when it comes to finishing around the basket is he falls way too much. He’s not going up strong and then when he falls he can’t get back on defense. Teach that guy to land on his feet when he drives and you might have a useful basketball player.
You’re right, but that doesn’t make the risk franchise breaking. You’re basically giving up Doug McDermott, who has failed in his first three stops, and a mid 40s draft pick to take a 15 month look at a 22 year old point guard.
I’m with you. A worse trade than what was thought/first reported isn’t equal to a bad trade, though. The Hernangomez trade was a bad trade even though I understand the reasoning behind it. He didn’t play because he’s objectively worse than KO and Kanter, and they wanted to ensure they had at least two picks in every draft. They still sold low and that’s annoying, but there probably wasn’t any room for Willy on this team anyway with KP needing to be a full time center.
According to Berman, the Knicks plan is to lure a free agent to NY to play with TH2, KP, and our 2018 and 2019 lottery picks. I consider Berman and Begley as the two guys plugged into the Knicks’ FO’s thinking, so hearing that gives me hope. If we get Michael Porter Jr this year and RJ Barrett next year we might not even need free agency. This front office sees 2020 as the season to build towards, and that always needed to be the case. KP had to tear an ACL to get us here, but at least we’re here and now the Knicks are looking to add as much through the draft as they can to bolster KP when he gets back.
@77 – yeah, but I ask again… where’s the 2019 money coming from for a young impact FA? We’ll almost certainly have to waive Noah and trade Lee for relief to get meaningful space…
@58. z-man. With all due respect, Sampson is a good comp in terms of frame, etc, but a bad comp in other ways:
Sampson hurt his left knee during the 1986-87 season but instead of staying on the sidelines he rushed his rehab and played on the bad knee. Sampson had very little cartilage in his left knee and his decision to return too soon proved to be an epic mistake. His game suffered from it and eventually curtailed his promising career.
“I should have been out for a year but came back after eight weeks because I wanted to play the game of basketball and the sport that I love,” Sampson said. “I probably came back a little too early, but we had a chance to go back to The Finals with the team we had, and I wanted to go back with my teammates.”
Z, my point was not to find a true comp, but to point out that injuries are part of the game. Twenty percent of life is what happens to you, 80 % is how you react. And, yes, as Phil said before KP had even played 1 minute in the NBA, “he may be too big to play.”
@79 agreed for the most part. I do worry that KP plays a style of ball that will not be friendly to his knees, given his long legs and high center of gravity. And hopefully he’s come closer to reaching his full potential than Ralph ever did.
Z. Agree. He needs to be broken down, even to the extent of not flailing his legs when he jumps. It’s up to him.

Planning our research it is an on-going process, once we start to find data we will have to go back to our search strategy and redefine it on the light of the new data. That´s why you will be required to keep a diary on our research process, to keep track on your decisions.
Blogs are great to this kind of work, we can easily start one and have a daily record on what we have done specially if we have to share the process with a team or our supervisor.
Gantt charts are great to organize our time, we can divide our project in different tasks and assign a time to each one. Through a Gantt chart we can easily see what has been done, what has to be done and how much time is left.
2. If possible start gathering information during the academic year so that during the summer you only need to refine your research to suit your topic.

Food safety is a scientific discipline describing handling, preparation, and storage of food in ways that prevent food-borne illness.
Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals.
Food preservation is to prevent the growth of microorganisms (such as yeasts), or other microorganisms (although some methods work by introducing benign bacteria or fungi to the food), as well as slowing the oxidation of fats that cause rancidity.
Foodborne illness (also foodborne disease and colloquially referred to as food poisoning) is any illness resulting from the food spoilage of contaminated food, pathogenic bacteria, viruses, or parasites that contaminate food, as well as toxins such as poisonous mushrooms and various species of beans that have not been boiled for at least 10 minutes.
Waitrose has launched a print advertising campaign based upon recent egg-related comments by Jose Mourinho, the football manager whose shock departure from Chelsea was revealed last night.
Oh a tempting offer... Remember all you have to do is keep shopping at Waitrose's online shopping website Ocado.com. It's as simple as that. Just place 129 orders over 90 between now and 21st October and in your 130th Ocado order we will deduct 30 off your delivery.
Food irradiation is the process of exposing foodstuffs to ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation is energy that can be transmitted without direct contact to the source of the energy (radiation) capable of freeing electrons from their atomic bonds (ionization) in the targeted food.
A food allergy is an abnormal immune response to food. The signs and symptoms may range from mild to severe.

Though everything outside this morning was flocked heavier than any christmas tree, it feels like springtime for me. (It helps that much of last night’s heavy snow has already melted!) Today marks my one year anniversary of leaving Puerto Rico and moving to Utah. It has been a very difficult year, chronicled in my old blog, A Series of Small Failures, which I am retiring today. The main goal in moving to Utah, into my parents’ basement (ouch–how i miss having a great job and a house of my own!), was to get out of the massive debt I was in, mostly due to opening and running my beautiful little organic vegetarian restaurant, Natural High. Rincon, the surfing mecca of the Caribbean, is gorgeous but sparsely populated when the tourists go home, making any business endeavor there impossibly challenging. A year later, I still don’t have a job and I’m still in debt, so when looking at the past year through that lens, I’m still failing. But it feels like time to change. I liked my old blog title originally because I felt like my life was truly a series of small failures. I wasn’t throwing a pity party — it was sort of tongue in cheek, trying to make light of the situation. I was processing. But it got really depressing. I like to think that failures are attempts at doing something grand, and I’d rather fail than not try at all. Still, it sounds so negative. And I am shedding that negative persona.
My parents convinced me to come home to Utah last year. Utah was never my home — i grew up in California — but Utah is where my brothers and their families live, as well as my mom and dad. And the offer to live rent free while i got back on my feet, something they’d offered for years, suddenly seemed like the only real option i had if I wanted to really move on. How easy it would have been to stay in Rincon, making the bare minimum to exist and having ample time to take my dogs to the beach every day… But I had depleted my entire life savings betting on myself and my restaurant (FAIL!). Now, that move seems almost prescient — if i was going to lose it anyway (and many people have lost most of their 401ks and other savings in the recent market madness), at least I got to spend it living on a tropical island and trying to build something of value that I owned. Worse than just losing everything I had saved, I actually took out loans to keep feeding the dream. You sort of have to drink your own Kool-aid when in business. If you don’t believe in yourself, who else will? I needed to move away, however, to break the connection to my ex, who I owned the restaurant with (imagine working with your ex practically every minute of every day). Plus, I thought getting a job in the states would be easier.
I didn’t think the job would be a problem. I was a staff writer for Fortune and the San Jose Mercury News. I had tons of experience. But no one would hire me! Even though I wanted to keep teaching yoga, I didn’t believe i could make anywhere near enough money to pay down my debt by teaching, and eliminating the debt was my primary goal. So I looked for journalism and other writing jobs. I did lots of freelance at first, but the recession hit. I’d apply for jobs and get no response whatsoever. I finally got an interview at a natural foods store for a position in their produce department, but after a three month search, the job went to someone else. Talk about demoralizing. In one of the most surreal events, I applied to be a census worker. I drove to Springville in February to take the test (a Kafkaesque experience in itself). As they hire people based on their test scores, and I had aced the test, I was sure I’d be hired. But I found this out later: when they have a position, they start at the top of the list. They call. If you don’t answer, they don’t leave a message and move on to the next name. After a little digging, I found out that they had tried to call me three times when I was in Connecticut last month working as a personal chef/private yoga instructor for a family–a career that seemed promising for a month or so, but fizzled because I slacked on promoting myself. Alas, there was no cell phone coverage in the home where I was staying and working, so I didn’t even get a missed call notification. I was so hoping for the Census experience because I needed the money — plus I thought it might be fun to write about working for the government. I even thought about joining the Navy Reserve. No joke. I was that desperate. One bright spot during that time: I wrote three articles for Yoga Journal — fun and rewarding.
As if dealing with unemployment and being broke and in debt wasn’t bad enough, we had a family tragedy last summer that made everything else seem unimportant. When my nephew died, I sank into such a deep depression that I really didn’t care about finding a job or pitching freelance articles or anything for quite a long time. I am so grateful that I could be here with my family through that, and to this day.
It feels so good to be emerging from that black period. Good things happened, to be sure. Healing happens, slowly. Rededicating myself to my daily yoga and meditation practice has been the key. I also started a daily yoga blog, which i kept up for about two weeks. FAIL! but at least I’ve been practicing every day. Also, feeling loved and accepted by my amazing boyfriend — who stuck with me through all the darkness — as well as other friends I gradually met helped immensely. It’s challenging meeting like-minded souls here in Utah County, but it’s happening.
I am crossing my fingers and praying that i’ll get this really cool job next month that seems likely to be mine. I’m practically counting the days until I can move out on my own again! I am talking to yoga studios about teaching again — for love, not so much for money. I finally put a few things up on Etsy, and I’m learning lost wax casting to make unique pieces to incorporate into my jewelry. Despite the desperate state of journalism, I actually was given an assignment last week to write about Iowa and Vermont’s recent same-sex marriage laws for Salon. I can’t even remember the last time someone called me and asked me to write something. Okay, yes, I do: it was my story of resigning from the Mormon Church last November after Proposition 8 passed, nullifying same sex marriages. But before that? It had probably been years since I was asked. As a freelancer, it’s usually the other way around.
So things are looking up. Tight buds are opening, gradually. I live near an orchard, and on my daily walks past it, I watch the trees blossom. Cherries, apples, apricots, peaches, plums, mulberries. I know them all, as I plundered them freely last summer and fall. I thought the orchard was abandoned, but it turns out that the man who owns it is old and wasn’t able to spray them last year — thank god for that! — so he didn’t bother harvesting them. It seemed such a shame to watch the fruit wither and fall. Those were the best cherries and apples I have ever eaten. Plus it was so beautiful to observe the fruit growing through the months. Perhaps the anticipation of its eventual ripeness made picking and eating it more enjoyable.
It’s still challenging living in my parents’ basement, not having a job, trying to create structure and motivate myself to keep writing and creating jewelry and making my credit card payments. My parents are constantly giving me advice: “Just get a job at a bookstore! Just get any job!” But I’m grateful for the time to cocoon, think and heal. Taking the wrong thing means not being available for the right thing. Which I think this thing is. I hope I hope I hope. Here’s to new beginnings. I miss Puerto Rico. I miss my friends, my yoga teaching, my restaurant, the beach, and the dogs I left behind with my ex. I brought two of them with me, but I only have Pooka left. Gogo seems to be adjusting pretty well to his new home. I still miss him every day.

Since its opening in 2002, Ford Field has not only been home to the Detroit Lions, but has hosted some big events as well. SuperBowl XL, Wrestlemania 23, 2011 Gold Cup, the NCAA Tournament, and the Frozen Four are just some of the major events that have already taken place at this beautiful stadium. With it being such an attraction, its owners are contemplating making a massive change to the stadium.
Detroit Lions president Rod Wood told WJR-AM (760) Monday morning that he, along with other Lions executives, are looking into installing a retractable roof in order to help bring a Major League Soccer team to Detroit, according to Freep.
It's something we're looking at. We're going to have a meeting later this week. It's been an interesting process working with Dan (Gilbert) and Tom Gores and their teams, and Arn Tellem is pretty much leading this pitch with MLS. With all the vibrancy downtown and all the young people now working downtown that love soccer, and coming off the World Cup where everybody was very interested in what's going on. It'd be great to have that downtown, but we'll see about the roof.
I think the addition of a retractable roof would definitely turn some heads and help out their chances of landing a pro soccer team.

This e-book contends that mainstream concerns of the industrial and social strength of tradition, together with theories of the inventive type and of cognitive and immaterial exertions, are indebted to ancient conceptions of the paintings of literary authorship. It indicates how modern literature has been curious about and has spoke back to creative-economy phenomena, together with the presentation of artists as types of contentedly versatile and self-managed paintings, the therapy of educating in and publicity to paintings as a pathway to social inclusion, using tradition and cultural associations to extend estate values, and aid for cultural range as a method of growing to be cultural markets.
Contemporary writers have tended to discover how their very own severe capacities became appropriate with or perhaps necessary to a neoliberal financial system that has embraced art's self sustaining gestures as evidence that genuine self-articulation and social engagement can and will ensue inside of capitalism. Taking a sociological method of literary feedback, Sarah Brouillette translates significant works of latest fiction by way of Monica Ali, Aravind Adiga, Daljit Nagra, and Ian McEwan along executive coverage, social technology, and theoretical explorations of inventive paintings and immaterial labor.

For the huge amounts of audio and video material that could usefully be included in digital libraries, the cost of producing human-generated annotations and meta-data is prohibitive. In the Informedia Digital Video Library, the production of meta-data supporting the library interface is automated using techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI). By applying speech recognition, natural language processing and image analysis, the interface helps users locate the information they want and navigate or browse the digital video library more effectively. Specific AI-based interface components include automatic titles, filmstrips, video skims, word location marking and representative frames for shots.
MOBI-D (Model-Based Interface Designer) is a software environment the design and development of user interfaces from declarative interface models. End-users informally describe tasks and data, from end-users, from which developers construct formal models of user tasks and domain objects. The system supports development of presentation and dialog specifications from such models, and allows visualization of interface designs as units encompassing all relations and dependencies among the elements of task, data and user-interface specifications. MOBI-D is the first development environment to define an interface model as a comprehensive conceptual object, to identify an interface design as a declarative component of an interface model, and to establish a development cycle based on such a model. The sharable nature of the interface modeling language of MOBI-D, along with the open architecture of its system opens the door for many research areas in HCI to explore the benefits and potential of using interface models.

Fledermaus VR is a system that combines the flying and Fish Tank metaphors for viewpoint control. A key component of the system is the continuous scaling of the scene so that it always appears just behind the screen. This scaling is done even when flying over a virtual landscape. Because the scene is scaled, it is always in the right position for Fish Tank VR viewing. In addition, the scaling removes some of the problems that commonly occur with stereoscopic displays, it puts objects in the appropriate place for manipulation, and it can be used to modulate the flight velocity. The system is demonstrated with a cable laying application.
Multi-user virtual worlds are proliferating on the Internet. These are two and three dimensional graphical environments inhabited by users represented as digital actors called "avatars". Through this medium, a wide variety of Internet users are participating in a large scale social experiment and collaborating on a variety of projects. The inhabited virtual world is an exciting new medium for HCI professionals including interaction and graphic designers, and educators and researchers focused on distance learning and teleworking. It also appeals to children and ordinary users of the Internet as a vast new digital playground and a venue for personal expression. This demonstration will introduce participants to a variety of inhabited virtual worlds and give them hands-on experience in collaboratively building and interacting with other users in the worlds.
In this paper, we describe Alice Sat Here, a telerobotic installation in which participants in physical space and cyberspace are afforded extended means of interaction. Using live video served to the World Wide Web, telerobotic camera control (pan and tilt controlled remotely over the Web), and a wheeled electric throne driven by gallery visitors, Alice Sat Here becomes an interface at the intersection of physical space and cyberspace. By designing an installation as a physical metaphor for the Web, we hope to sensitize the public to the dynamics at work on the Web (surveillance, control), and to challenge the collective imagination of the kinds of experiences the Web can offer.
Envision is a multimedia digital library of computer science literature, with full-text searching and full-content retrieval capabilities. The Envision system is noteworthy for two characteristics: 1) the high quality of the search results returned by our free text search system and 2) a highly usable user interface that provides powerful information visualization facilities, enabling users explore patterns in the literature, changing the display as their interests change.
The knowledge-based system IRIS is designed to help users in analysis of spatially referenced statistical data. For this purpose the system provides the user with automatically built thematic maps presenting the data visually. The process of map design is governed by the domain-independent visualisation knowledge base. The user receives the opportunity to concentrate on data exploration instead of the process of planning and building data presentations. Implementation of the interface part of the system in Java language allows to run the system in the World Wide Web (WWW).
We demonstrate our CD-ROM, "Digital Photography at Lincoln High School: An Interactive Ethnography," as well as a web-based example of interactive ethnography. The goal of the work is to demonstrate a new medium for presenting the results of ethnographic studies to a wide audience. The richness of the ethnographic experience is easily lost in a text-only format. The CD-ROM uses audio, video, text, QuickTime VR, scanned images and digital photos to bring alive the experiences of the students and staff in the digital photography class.
SAGE is an authoring tool that allows children to design their own wise storytellers to interact with. It explicitly aims to enable them to explore their inner world, as well as to learn about storytelling and technology. In order to foster emotional engagement and explore the integration of physical and computer interfaces, the sage storyteller was embodied in a interactive stuffed animal.
Merging the Benefits of Paper Notebooks with the Power of Computers in Dynomite | BIBAK | HTML 22-23
Dynomite is a portable electronic notebook for the capture and retrieval of handwritten and audio notes. The goal of Dynomite is to merge the organization, search, and data acquisition capabilities of a computer with the benefits of a paper-based notebook. Dynomite provides novel solutions in four key problem areas. First, Dynomite uses a casual, low cognitive overhead interface. Second, for content indexing of notes, Dynomite uses ink properties and keywords. Third, to assist organization, Dynomite's properties and keywords define views, presenting a subset of the notebook content that dynamically changes as users add new information. Finally, to augment handwritten notes with audio on devices with limited storage, Dynomite continuously records audio, but only permanently stores those parts highlighted by the user.
This demonstration describes a new approach to algorithm animation, one in which the students construct the animations. We introduce the Samba system that facilitates this process and describe how it has been used an undergraduate algorithms courses as a teaching aid. Having students build the animations, that is, construct the mapping from concepts to images, appears to enable true understanding of the algorithm under study.
In end-user programming it is still hard to overcome the tension between usability and expressiveness. Some end-user programming approaches focus on simple use but they make it hard or even impossible to write programs expressing useful functionality. Other programming approaches can be very expressive by allowing the construction of arbitrary complex programs but this expressiveness comes at the price of usability. End user programming approaches that are at least reasonably usable and expressive at the same time require not merely a syntactic improvement of programming languages but a new way to conceptualize the programming process in a social context. Social behavior processing describes the idea of elevating programming components to the level of easily composable and decomposable entities that can be shared through the World Wide Web with a community of end-users. The Agentsheets Behavior Exchange is outlined here as a forum for end-user programmers, including middle school kids and professionals, to (a) compose behaviors in order to create interactive SimCityTM-like simulations and games, to (b) comprehend behaviors created by other users or by themselves, and to (c) share these behaviors with other users.

"Eudaemonic Eye;" "Personal Imaging" and Wearable Computing as a Result of Deconstructing HCI; towards Greater Creativity and Self-Determination | BIBAK | HTML 28-29
The apparatus for 'personal imaging' consists of a combination of the author's 'existential computer' invention (hardware portion also referred to as the "wearable computer") with an electronic camera as the primary input device. Personal imaging, a conceptual framework around this simple apparatus, is first presented as a new research area, and then applications to the visual arts, and to personal documentary, are presented.
Music is a rich communication medium, and there are some similarities between the job of a music composer and that of an HCI designer (although their objectives may be different). Whilst sound has been used in interfaces, its use has mainly been at a primitive level, often involving real-world sound. Since music offers a highly structured set of mechanisms for communicating, it is surprising that there have been so few attempts at exploring its possibilities. Our current activity involves investigations into the use of music in algorithmic audiolisation and program debugging.
Querying of visual databases has relied predominantly on text based systems. Words do not provide an appropriate or adequate means of describing visual artifacts. A system (DIVIUS) has been developed which allows users to describe and query objects in a pictorial database, using a visual language derived from the database objects. Users can also indicate their level of uncertainty regarding certain attributes of the query.
In this paper, we describe a demonstrator which was developed in the course of the European project TIDE 1004: HEPHAISTOS (Home Environment Private Help AssISTant fOr elderly and diSabled). The demonstrator constitutes a hand held personal home assistant capable to control a selected range of electronic home devices. Its multimodal user interface is based on a coloured high resolution touch screen extended with speech input/output. The development process focused on taking into account requirements of elderly people and people with special needs. The usability of the personal assistant was evaluated in a series of user tests with subjects from this particular demographic groups.
The Mediator prototype which is demonstrated is the result of exploratory research into domestic online entertainment services. Mediators are anthropomorphic guides who aid users in selection and navigation to content in interactive television services. The project goals include developing prototype services and navigation tools and carrying out extensive user tests. The main focus of the work is to develop models of interaction, functionality and system behaviour.
Efficiency and quality of solving problems by people are greatly affected by the way in that relevant information is arranged and presented. There is a need for intelligent software assisting humans by automatic generation of adequate presentations. We focus on graphical and especially cartographic data presentations and distinguish two problem classes where these presentations have high potential: data exploration and communication. It is argued that graphics design principles should be different for these two classes. Data communication is treated in a wider sense than merely report making: it is proposed to consider a "visual message" being built with respect to author's pragmatic goals, beliefs, attitudes, etc., as well as the image of the addressee. We outline the necessary research directions and reason about the role that could be played in such a research by the prototype knowledge-based system IRIS we have developed earlier.
In connection with semiotic aspects of visual languages we define and generalize the content of such conception as visual metaphor, visual language dictionary, visual expressiveness, adequacy in visualization. The experimental system ParaVision should help to search the techniques for evaluating of such characteristics as adequacy in visualization that is as far as a given visual system may satisfy the needs of a given user for solving of a given problem.
A graphical environment that implements visual programming techniques based on autonomous agents is presented. The model consists of active entities called agents, and passive entities such as behaviours, trajectories, actions, and conditions. The agents have a rule based behaviour defined as a spatial and temporal evolution. A consistent set of agent structures, actions and rule types is highlighted to support a general oriented visual programming. The model concerns on the notion of trajectory and topological information used in a cooperative evolution to control applications which are based on real time processes synchronization, data flow diagrams, graphical animation, metaphorical user interface, visual programming, multimedia and artificial intelligence techniques.

This paper describes market-related and social background of existing limitations in transferring usability engineering methods to software companies in Poland. Typical approaches of software vendors, developers, managers and users are shortly presented as possible reasons of low usability of many local software products. Providing information, guidelines and usability services are discussed as means for developing usability consciousness among all stakeholders involved in developing software for management support.
The paper describes the current situation and historical development in the HCI field in the Czech Republic. An outline of the most important features in this area is given. The reader can get ideas about the current state of art especially in research and education. A description of the situation in some specific applications is also given. In summary, the reader can find a short evaluation given together with some proposals on how to improve the current situation in the HCI field in this particular country.
There are many well documented problems facing the ordinary user, as opposed to the enthusiast, of Hypermedia (HM) technology which can lead these users to be frustrated by, or give-up using hypermedia technology altogether. Among these classic HM problems are: the Framing Problem, Framing And Intercomparision Combined, Link Types, Versioning And Historical Backtrack, Closed Context and Open Media, Adding These Aspects Later, Disorientation [3], Information Structuring Systems [2], Visualizing [4]. This paper focuses on one of these key problems, "the Framing Problem" -- as the number of hypermedia objects grows the problem of restricting our attention to only the relevant connections becomes harder [3]. How can we structure the source hypermedia to show semantically related clusters? By solving this problem it is possible to offer new ways for people to search and browse hypermedia.
Displayless interface technology must address challenges similar to those presented by the problem of providing GUI access to visually impaired users. Both must address the issue of providing nonvisual access to spatial data. This research examines the hypothesis that such access places a cognitive burden on the user, which in turn will impact the prosodics, i.e. nonverbal aspects, of the user's speech.
Communicative presence (CP) has been defined as "... the capacity of a system to transfer mutual communicative signals of interlocutors." [2]. The main objective of my research is to define communicative presence more precisely and improve it in Desktop Video Conferencing Systems (DVCSs). An initial experiment has suggested that the modality of all available channels should be consistent.
In the proposed work, research in cognitive science and display-based HCI is synthesized and brought to bear on the question of "what makes GUI good?". A two-phase approach is outlined. The empirical phase will build upon a foundation laid by display-based HCI research. The computational modeling phase will be informed by the empirical phase and previous modeling efforts. The primary goal is to be able to explicate conditions under which a user will rely on external display components vs. internal knowledge structures to control task performance.
Multimedia communication is influenced by increasing complexity and reach of information and by a rapidly growing user population. Due to these developments average authors of electronically published media have little expert knowledge in multimedia presentations. They are also confronted with considerable individual differences of recipients in culture, social life, education, psychology and physiology. In order to compensate for these shortcomings it is necessary to integrate interpretation and interaction abilities of individual users into future presentation and editing systems. We are developing a chart editing system which generates critics by user request. These critics are based on a user model, on expert knowledge in chart editing and on the currently edited chart. The system helps the author to avoid commonly made mistakes. It empowers recipients to adjust certain parameters (e.g.: colors) to their individual abilities and needs.
Efforts for creating usable systems which fulfill the purpose of being efficient and effective tools in an enterprise have been focused on the software itself. The study proposed here turns to the user, and to what the user contributes with for that use. The study explores the concepts of usability and qualities of software in use, and their relationship to end-users learning to use the software, in a case study approach. The understanding developed during this study will be used in an intervention study, which aims at proposing a way for formal training to contribute to usability and quality in use.
Establishing that machines cannot automate creative design and that it is a difficult task for humans, I propose a computational model based on the human and machine complementarity and collaboration.
The Multimodal GUI: Developing Auditory Cues as Tools for Performance and Usability | BIBAK | HTML 63-64
Designers who use sound in the computer interface must do so judiciously. The inclusion of auditory cues within an interface should be a mechanism for the improvement of task performance and the facilitation of usability. Gaver [6] and Blattner [1] have demonstrated the utility of auditory cues in communicating information to users. The usage of "spatially-enhanced" speech and nonspeech elements could provide an additional source of data that might help or hurt performance. The usefulness of an auditory cue could be linked to acoustical parameters, spatialization, and task type. The proposed study will assess the improvement of user performance for various types of auditory cues as applied to spatial and verbal computer tasks. These results will be important to multimedia developers who want to create software that facilitates user acceptance or the quality of user performance.
In producing a design to visualize search results for a digital library called Envision [5, 7], we found that choosing graphical devices and document attributes to be encoded with each graphical device is a surprisingly difficult task. By graphical devices we mean those visual display elements (e.g., color, shape, size, position, etc.) used to convey encoded information. Research in several areas provides scientific guidance for design and evaluation of graphical encodings which might otherwise be reduced to opinion and personal taste. However, literature offers inconclusive and often conflicting viewpoints, leading us to further empirical research.
This paper describes my research on the adoption of groupware technologies in business organizations, and their subsequent integration with individual and organizational work practices as a result of wide, sustained use. An initial study of two organizations successfully using a particular groupware technology -- electronic calendars and meeting schedulers -- revealed several technical, behavioral, and organizational factors that enabled initial adoption. Additional findings from this study suggested that groupware technology was integrated into work practices quite differently at each site, despite similarities in adoption patterns and other organizational features. My dissertation research will continue to elaborate the conditions that enable adoption of groupware technologies. My investigations will also explore the way electronic calendars are subsequently integrated into local work practices, and the organizational ramifications of these particular adaptations.
One theory of environmental cognition suggests that both declarative landmark knowledge and procedural route knowledge are essential in structuring internal representations of the environment; such representations facilitate effective navigation in that environment [5, 7]. The proposed study will provide data to test this theory. The application that will be studied is an Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS), which provides route guidance information to automobile drivers. Current route guidance systems incorporate only procedural route information in their route guidance displays (i.e., they give directions for getting to your destination without supplying landmarks to identify the route [e.g., 3]). This study will evaluate how the inclusion of landmark icons in ATIS displays affects users' navigation performance. The results will be important to ATIS developers, who need to know what informational elements to include in ATIS route guidance displays to most effectively support navigation tasks. The results will also be important in a theoretical sense, by testing a theory of environmental cognition with real-world navigation tasks.
Face-to-face collaboration of small groups is one of the most common forms of group work, yet group-aware computer support for this type of collaboration is limited. My research examines the effectiveness of Single Display Groupware (SDG), computer systems that support face-to-face collaboration around a single computer display. Together with the help of a group of elementary school children, I will design and build a prototype SDG system called Sushi that is an authoring tool for interactive multimedia stories.

The aim of this research is to assess and establish quality thresholds for real-time Internet audio and video. Real-time multimedia conferencing over the Internet has huge potential, but there are limitations to the quality of audio and video that can be achieved, due to bandwidth limitations and the processing power of individual workstations. Assessing the effects of these limitations on the conference participant is not straightforward. The novel types of degradation found over the Internet means that existing speech and video quality assessment methods may not be applicable to multimedia conferencing experiences. This PhD will assess existing tests for measuring perceived quality from the psychology and telecommunications literature with respect to multimedia conferencing. The long term aim is to produce guidelines as to required bandwidth and quality for different multimedia conferencing tasks and applications.
The School of Information at the University of Michigan is a new graduate school that offers highly interdisciplinary opportunities in education and research. We have a program in HCI as well as Library and Information Sciences, Archives and Record Management, and are discussing offerings in Future Systems Architecture, Organizational Information Systems.
This presentation describes how and why Usability Engineering is being introduced at London Life. It describes the unique set of circumstances that were present allowing us to integrate usability engineering from day one in a project. It will cover our approach to learning about and institutionalizing the usability process into a well established internal systems development area. Our future plans will also be discussed.
Toshiba's Human Interface Research Group is pursuing media understanding and intelligent interaction technologies to achieve natural multimodal HCI (human-computer interaction). In collaboration with Toshiba's other corporate laboratories, engineering laboratories and business divisions, we have been developing practical interactive systems and products related to information services, consumer electronics, document filing and industrial equipment.
A successful startup in the arena of enterprise software, Trilogy Development Group began experimenting with HCI as a means for improving user reactions to their products. Two years have passed since the first experiments; in that time an entire HCI group was created and has subsequently become a respected and critical component of Trilogy's development process, as well as taking some responsibility for providing a vision for Trilogy's future. This paper chronicles our experiences in bringing the "design stance" to Trilogy.
The NCR Human Interface Technology Center (HITC) exists to meet its customers' business needs through the application of new human-interface technologies. The HITC designs and develops these user-interface solutions through a user-centered design (UCD) process, in which user needs and expectations guide all design and development decisions. The HITC consists of about 90 engineers and scientists with expertise in such areas as cognitive engineering, graphic design, image understanding, artificial intelligence, intelligent tutoring, database mining, and new I/O technologies. Established in 1988, the HITC is funded by work performed for its customers.
The Common User Interface Services (CUIS) group at Boeing is a full-featured support organization for Boeing user interface developers. The group has achieved key successes and has increased the visibility of the importance of usability engineering to the point where it has been established as a key corporate initiative in 1996.
Netscape Communications is a company that has grown faster than any other software company in history. Although the design effort at Netscape has evolved greatly, the initial experience of bringing design into an organization in hypergrowth provided some valuable lessons in the creation of a successful design organization.
HCI at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) of the University of Puerto Rico -- Mayaguez (UPRM) has taken center stage in the Computer Engineering program in just three years. This growth has been reflected in the academic programs, research, facilities, faculty, and students. Our research and academic emphasis is on usability engineering and programming of user interfaces.
This presentation describes the Human Interface Design department at Fidelity Investments. Although not in the computer hardware or software business, Fidelity develops an amazingly wide variety of systems in support of our business. The Human Interface Design department, which is composed of people from a variety of backgrounds, provides several key services to systems development projects throughout the company, including user interface design and prototyping, usability testing, and online help development. We are also responsible for the corporate Graphical User Interface Style Guide and Web Design Guide. Examples of the development projects we assist with are described, as well as strategic projects that address more general human interface issues.
This paper describes the User-Centered Globalization Group at AT&T, which provides internationalization and localization consulting services within AT&T and to outside customers. It reviews the group's history and areas of expertise, and discusses sample projects and future strategy.
This presentation describes the Usability Services group at Compuware-Madison. Compuware-Madison is part of the national Compuware Professional Services Division, which provides consulting services for the computing industry, primarily data processing divisions of corporations. The Usability Services group was developed to help clients who are moving from traditional mainframe environments to newer technologies that use graphical user interfaces (GUIs). A group organized specifically to address usability issues is atypical in the data processing area, both from the client corporation and the consulting provider's perspective. This presentation describes how the group came to be, its projects, the challenges it faces, and its successes.
This debate questions the presumption that the future of human-computer interaction resides in the computing sciences. We propose the following resolution: It is resolved that the CHI community should disassociate from professional computing societies and realign closely with professional design societies. The four panelists will form two teams with Terry Winograd & Jim Faris arguing for the resolution and Paul Dourish & Wendy Kellogg arguing against it. It is our intention to evoke the widest possible range of viewpoints and discussion in the community on this very important topic for the future of human computer interaction.
How can interaction designers ensure that their work makes its way into the final implementation of a product? The language, tools and techniques for communicating design ideas within the interactive product development domain are currently emerging. This panel provides insight into promising approaches by examining the ways in which several practitioners have succeeded, and failed, at transferring their design ideas to current products.

You are up against a million other Web sites: how do you get users to come to your site? This panel will visit live sites on the WWW and debate what works and doesn't work in Web user interfaces.
Critical issues in human-computer interaction -- in particular, the advantages and disadvantages of intelligent agents and direct manipulation -- will be discussed, debated, and hotly contested. The intent of the participants is to strike an appropriate balance between a serious discussion of the issues and an entertaining debate.
This panel will discuss teleworking experiences. Our panel consists of several types of teleworkers, a manager of a teleworker and a researcher who studied teleworking. The panel will address questions concerning the value of telework, the factors that affect success of telework, and the way in which telework changed their job.
As we look to the future of HCI education, it is clear that, despite major HCI curriculum initiatives [1, 2], there is little consensus in the CHI community about what the content of HCI education should include or about how and by whom that content should be delivered. This panel gives voice to both prevailing and minority opinions on the subject.
Our children are fast becoming one of the largest new user groups taking advantage of emerging technologies. How our children learn, play, and communicate are quickly changing. This panel will not ask the question whether technology will be a part of our children's lives. The panel participants believe this is a given. Instead, the panelists, professionals in developing new technologies for children, will consider the impact and possible changes that may be in store for our children and their future technologies. Once the panelists have offered brief statements on their visions of the future, children from the CHIkids program will be discussants and ask questions that concern them about the future of new technologies for children.
This session brings together several leading structure visualization and browsing technologies for an entertaining yet informative "live" comparison. Users of each system will compete "head-to-head" in a series of races designed to simulate the stressful conditions under which real world browsing often takes place. Expert and novice operators will use four different visualization and browsing tools to complete a set of generic retrieval tasks as quickly and accurately as possible within the same information space. Attendees will be able to see for themselves which techniques work well or poorly as each system demonstrates its potential for a range of users.
This panel explores approaches to making usability research more strategic within organizations -- not just with respect to the product development life cycle, but pervasive throughout the organization. Six panelists discuss different ways in which usability can be strategic, depending on their organizational environments or "profiles."
This program takes a critical look at mid-20th-century utopian promises and persuasions as dramatized in industrial and advertising films released between 1936 and 1965. In these films and related advertising campaigns, major American corporations appropriated old utopian ideas as their own, promising a bright, affluent future enabled by cybernetics, household technology, and new means of transportation and communication. Despite the amusing anachronisms in these films, many of the ideas they promote are still very much part of corporate discourse today, and have had a tremendous effect on shaping public expectations and attitudes towards information technology.
This article addresses the following questions: Where do we stand today with respect to achieving universal access to the Internet? What is required (particularly in the HCI realm) to achieve it? What are some of the consequences and side-effects -- positive and negative -- for society?
Interfaces intended to support learning should be considered with respect to a typology based on student audience, constructive functionality, navigation support, cognitive cost and added learning value. Analysed like this, the quality of interfaces used by students has noticeably improved over the past 10 years, in dramatic contrast to the much slower change in pedagogic value of educational software. The potential for the use of computers in support of interaction between learners, their peers and remote information sources has revealed important weaknesses inherent in current approaches to navigation support. Key problems include scaleability, accessing peer learners and the shape and size of information spaces.
A nice homeless man called Craig sometimes sleeps on me – Hunters Bar roundabout. Craig is real and is very well known and liked in these parts – look:
Another individual who occasionally crops up in the tales of Hunters Bar is Homeless Stu - a friend of Craig’s who is tortured by inner demons.
True fact – there are 9 pubs within 1000 metres of Hunters Bar Roundabout – look (true fact courtesy of @rjcopley) http://twitpic.com/544qvn/full
Brocco Bank heads up the hill towards Broomhill and the Botanical Guardians. Like Hunters Bar, Broomhill is thronged with students. Broomhill is home to several halls of residencies which are usually the haunt of first year students. This means that Broomhill is also full of people in their forties shaking their heads and asking each other “Is he/she really old enough to be at university?”
Ecclesall Road (Eccy Rd) heads East towards town. People come from miles around to revel in its kitchness. Restaurants and pubs, pubs and restaurants. Shops that spring up and then shut down a month later. Shops that sell nothing but chocolate, shops that sell nothing but coffee.
Waitrose at the town end and M&S ‘ecco’ in the middle - they’ve gentrified the shit out of Eccy Road.
Rotherham Council once announced their intention to do up Rotherham Town Centre and “bring something of the spirit of Ecclesall Road to Rotherham” – all they needed to do was decorate the pavement with the odd vomit splatter and they’d have cracked it.
Sharrow Vale Road runs parallel to Eccy Road. Even more ‘boho’ than Eccy Road, SVR boasts a range of knick-knack shops that sell stuff that nobody could possible need. It has recently been confirmed that these shops are a front for drug dealers.
Steep steep hills with serried rows of terraced houses. Hunter Hill Road, Hunter House Road, Pinner and Penryn. Roads so steep that you need oxygen to make it to the top.
Most of the houses have been bought by landlords and are occupied by students. The downstairs bay windows of these houses have iPhones, X-boxes and laptops pressed against them to make target selection easier for opportunistic burglars.
The few ‘normal’ citizens that remain have given up trying to sleep through the noise of the students in the houses on either side. Instead they have evolved to become nocturnal and, like the students themselves, they sleep through the day.
It’s worth the climb to the top of the hill as here sits the wonderful Psalter Tavern (on Psalter Lane).
Eccy Road continues up the hill heading for Banner Cross then out through the huge houses of Ecclesall Road South. Did you know that this area of Sheffield is the most affluent constituency outside of the south-east of England, with almost 12% of residents earning over £60,000 a year?
In the previous text I presented several economic hypotheses explaining why the developed world has entered what could possibly be a prolonged period of economic stagnation. In today's text (note: long read) I will present my own opinion, arguing that what we are experiencing is a temporary slowdown which could last for several decades, but one that could also provide the greatest opportunity for the next huge boost in living standards. I hypothesize that the underlying factor behind both the current temporary stagnation (particularly in productivity and real wages) and the upcoming rise in living standards is - technology.
As I've emphasized several times on the blog before, I believe we are currently, for the past 30 years, in the period of the Third Industrial Revolution. And in our times, it's only heating up, with the potential to bring to some new disruptive innovations that could change our world as much as the previous two industrial revolutions had. The technological progress we are currently undergoing will, without doubt, be disruptive. As it always is. But in its disruptive nature it will bring greater benefits for the future generations. Automated work being replaced by robots will surely lead to job losses. But in a new economy, the job losses could be offset by a series of new opportunities and entirely new careers. Which ones in particular, we can't really tell at this moment. But just like the first two industrial revolutions brought completely new jobs and changed the world as we know it (more than 95% of jobs that exist today didn't exist before the 18th century), so will the Third bring in new jobs and new possibilities we can't even imagine. Social networks have already introduced new types of occupations (social network experts being the most dubious one). Various bloggers and youtubers have managed to turn their hobby into a money making venture. Firms are just beginning to exploit the Internet, and its users are just uncovering the various ways they can make money on it. None of this was even conceivable back in the 1990s when our remote Internet usage was often wrapped around in frustration with our dial-up connection (remind yourself of that glorious sound, I know you want to!). Today so much more opportunities await.
The good thing about this inevitable change is that it tends to be gradual. This meaning that even if robots and automated work start replacing low-skilled jobs, this will all still happen during a prolonged period where it will be possible to maintain a generational switch.
What does this mean in particular? Let's take the example of the taxi market and the driverless car (or if you want - Uber, which is the intermediate step). Naturally if driverless cars all start hitting the streets they will almost immediately take away all the jobs from the taxi drivers. Which is likely to cause them to rebel, quite legitimately so. One always has an incentive to protect their job and their immediate interest. A good way to achieve a peaceful transition would be to allow the technological breakthrough to enter gradually by having the taxi drivers operating and overseeing the driverless cars at first. This would, on one hand, correspond to a permanent barrier to entry for any new driver, however all the current drivers would keep their jobs. Until retirement or until they find another job, whichever comes first. Each current driver would therefore still be driving/riding the driverless car and providing for example local advice to tourists. This would then be a perfect way to tell whether or not the passengers really enjoy the conversation and demand for the actual person to be in the car, or do they just prefer the robot to take them where they need to go without speaking to it. It's all about having choices! And in this way to minimize the despair of potential job losses imposed by the new technology. But I digress.
The current slowdown is essentially of temporary effect as we're currently in a transitional period from the old industry-driven economy (including the service industry) to the new digitally-driven economy. The industry-driven economy still rests upon the old industrial classification paradigm: the primary sector (agriculture, fishing, and mining), the secondary sector (manufacturing, production), and the tertiary sector (services). So far in the history of the West we have witnessed the transition from an agricultural-dominant economy to a manufacturing-driven economy (the First Industrial Revolution in the 18th century), a shift from manufacturing to rapid industrialization in the 19th and beginning of the 20th century (the Second Industrial Revolution driven by mass innovation), and a shift from industrialization to services in the final part of the 20th century following a period of rapid globalization.
Now we are facing something different - a shift beyond the standard paradigm. Disruptive technological progress will rapidly change our patterns of production and of specialization. It will be nothing like the world we knew so far. Just like the first two industrial revolutions brought us to a state of the economy not known to us before. In the 16th and 17th century having a locomotion and machines was unimaginable. In the 18th century having electricity, cars, airplanes, and modern medicine was unimaginable. After WWI having computers and traveling to space was unimaginable. 40 years ago a cell phone was unimaginable, while a mere 15 years ago a smartphone was unimaginable. True, there were always visionaries who offered their overly enthusiastic views of the future by simply extrapolating the current levels of technological progress. In the 1960s visions of the future included flying cars, intergalactic travel, jet-packs, and personal robots, all by the year of 2000 (check out some of the futurist visions from that time - some of them actually did come to existence; also read this piece to see which predictions came true).
Why don't many people see this obvious advantage of the technological progress so far? A famous quotation from Nobel prize winner Robert Sollow: "You can see the computer age everywhere except in the productivity statistics" is actually true. There is a productivity paradox where the advances in computing power haven't really made workers more productive. This is contrary to the idea that automation of work should increase total factor productivity. Essentially the idea is that despite all the benefits the Internet has brought to us (instant global communication, entirely new business and marketing models, different consumer behavior patterns, social networking, even spontaneous mass gatherings), it has made only marginal improvements in well-being, at least compared to the non-internet age of the 1980s. The technology skeptics cite similar examples where modern technologies only offered marginal improvements over the products we enjoy today. For example, whereas the first invention of the car was a huge advantage over a horse, its further improvements, after reaching a certain level of speed and safety, were marginal. Airplanes are a similar example. Yes, today they tend to be much safer, but flight times are still similar to what they were 50 years ago. The smartphone was an improvement over the regular cell phone, but not as much as the cell phone was an improvement over the landline, and both not as much as the regular landline was an improvement over letters and telegrams.
However all these examples are missing the point. We are still at the very early stages of the Third Industrial Revolution - the Digital Revolution. We are slowly entering the Information age. The Internet has made much bigger changes than standard economic indicators would suggest. Particularly since most of them were indirect. The Internet has, without doubt, changed the patterns of firm specialization and has increased the rate of trial and error as well as innovation. The vast availability of information online can improve business strategies and force businesses to adapt to the Internet revolution. Those that don't, lose customers. No matter what industry they are in. In the upcoming decades this will become even more obvious. Furthermore, the Internet has had a key role in promoting economic opportunity for all, particularly for the underprivileged. To start a business all you need is a laptop and an internet connection (of course, this varies from country to country depending on the scope of regulations). Most importantly the Internet and the increasing socialization it has brought with it can be used to foster democracy and the empowerment of the middle classes. That is one of its, by far, biggest advantages. Social networks and the Internet can do more in overthrowing dictators and holding politicians accountable in democracies than the media ever could. (Obviously they can also be used in an opposite capacity - by distributing fake news and encouraging bubble behavior; but to be fair, fake news and living in bubbles happened way before the Internet).
For all these reasons, in the upcoming Information Age, the Internet should be free for all - a global public good. Free access to the Internet should be a human right (the UN has done a lot in promoting this idea, there is even an initiative to implement the Internet as a basic human right, but some disagreements still remain). Nevertheless, its creation of economic opportunity, its role in fostering democracy by empowering the middle classes, its ease of access to education (online courses can do wonders!) are more than enough to declare it a human right and offer it as a global public good. This is something that the future might hold for us - free Internet, worldwide. (Although, don't be so sure on the "free" part. We have access to electricity and clean water, but both still come at a cost).
Even with all those advantages at hand, we have currently reached a ceiling with our pre-IT revolution models of economic growth. Japan is perhaps the best example. A huge booming economy for 30 years following the recovery after WWII, it was hit by a housing bubble burst in 1990 and has experienced very low to zero economic growth ever since. In the past 26 years Japan grew, on average, by 0.7%. Its lost decade of the 90s has turned into two lost decades and is now in the middle of a third. Its public debt is the largest in the world, and by a long shot (public debt to GDP is 230%, higher than even Greece, with debt to GDP at 170%). For the entire 26-year period inflation has been close to 0, borderline deflation, as have their interest rates. Needless to say Japan has done a series of monetary and fiscal stimuli to prompt up their economy throughout this period, but nothing has worked. The consequences of both are highly visible in their over-expanded monetary base and huge debt.
But in reality, there is nothing wrong with Japan. Yes its economic indicators are terrible, yes the population is ageing which is always a problem in countries with high debt levels, but Japan remains one of the richest countries in the world. Their GDP per capita (PPP) is around $38,000 which is quite a lot for a country with 127 million people. The only comparable in population size is the US with a GDP per capita (PPP) of $55,000. But beyond GDP, Japan ranks highest in many of the measures of living standards and well-being. By life expectancy they are no.1 in the world (84 years on average!), their human development index, prosperity index, happiness index all put them among the top performers. Their health care and education system are flourishing, they have low crime rates, and decreasing inequality. One conventional economic indicator - unemployment - always managed to stay low, at around 4%. And their levels of innovation and technological adaptation are arguably among the world's highest if not the highest. The vast majority of the population is therefore enjoying really good living standards. It seems that low GDP growth, ongoing deflation, and high public debt (as long as it is held by the domestic population in a country stable and rich enough to have a huge demand for its debt, particularly domestic in this case), don't really hamper living standards. The two and a half decades of stagnation have not apparently taken their toll on well-being.
So what's the story here? Japan has simply reached a level of very high living standards combined with a strive for technological innovation that has perhaps even worsened some productivity numbers and possibly GDP growth as well (although there are a number of reasons why GDP growth was low in Japan). The IT revolution took huge proportions in Japan. Anyone who's ever been there speaks of its technological superiority and a number of "cool gadgets". Few of these gadgets have raised GDP, but they have contributed to the well-being of the population, and more importantly, they have opened vast new opportunities for its population. It takes time for these to be seized in order to produce a high magnitude well-being effect.
The point is that we are currently experiencing a stagnation caused by a series of factors, one of which is certainly the technological revolution. I've written on that before on multiple occasions. Essentially, technological progress began by shifting jobs and changing the patterns of specialization and production. This will go on for several more decades. But the further it unfolds, the more benefits it will bring that will be immediately noticeable to us. In other words, think of the current stagnation in wages and productivity (and hence economic growth) as an indirect consequence of the upcoming and ongoing technological progress. It takes time for the people to recognize the new patterns of specialization and to exploit the opportunities for new jobs. With the start of the IT revolution in the 80s we've already noticed a series of new jobs being created. It all started with companies like IBM, Dell, HP, and Apple to provide the hardware. Then came Microsoft and revolutionized the software (Apple made it even cooler later on in the second coming of Steve Jobs). Then the Internet giants started emerging: Google, Facebook, Amazon, YouTube, eBay and many others. (The criticism these companies get is that while they replaced many old jobs in manufacturing, it wasn't actually a one-for-one replacement. They created much less jobs than what manufacturing companies created.)
All these new companies emerged in the very beginning of the IT revolution (some even before like IBM). Expect many more of these to come in the following decades. Don't necessarily expect new search engines, software manufactures, online retailers, or social networks. No, the new high tech companies will be about something completely different. They will most likely strive on the benefits provided by all these companies before them (we all have laptops, running on either Windows or Mac, and we all use Google, Facebook, YouTube, etc.).
The current level of technological development set the stage for the Next Big Thing. They didn't replace all the lost jobs, and were on that front mostly disruptive innovations. For now. However the foundations have been laid. These foundations are supported by the current (temporary) industry giants. And most importantly they provide the nurturing environment for growth, for new companies that one day will be even greater and will perhaps not only change the jobs market, they could profoundly change our way of life (e.g. robot manufacturing companies, or nanotech companies, or AI producers, or fusion energy companies - a bit too much? Or is it?). In 50 or 100 years from now we may look down on manual labor and automated work as relics of the past. And no one will complain as everyone will find such jobs meaningless and will have the time to pursue their most desired careers. It might sound a bit idealistic from today's point of view but who knows. Cars, trains, and airplanes sounded idealistic back when the First Industrial Revolution was underway, but today we know of no better form of transportation. At this point, we can only imagine.
Now, all this is just a theory. I can devise a multitude of examples and arguments in support of it, but I cannot really test it. Yet. Time will tell basically whether or not this thinking has any merit at all. I do however carry a slightly optimistic bias in believing that we live in awesome times and are on the verge of a breakthrough that most of us simply aren't aware of. My optimistic bias makes me a bit subjective towards the impact of technological progress on future living standards, but drawing simply from historical patterns and the possibilities being uncovered to us, the IT revolution is nothing to be feared.
We must encourage people to have green marketing thesis. It will pursue their most desired careers. It might sound a bit idealistic from today's point of view but who knows.
I don't think the stagnant wages and productivity should be surprising given the empirical evidence shows outsourcing is largely an exercise in labor cost arbitrage and that immigration shifts gains from workers to capital owners. I don't find the lack of wage, productivity gains or rising inequality as surprising.
Hi, I’m Diane C. Brown.Thanks for sharing. I have gone through your articles. This really is just about the most essential post. Automated work being replaced by robots will surely lead to job losses. But in a new economy, the job losses could be offset by a series of new opportunities and entirely new careers. Which ones in particular, we can't really tell at this moment. http://onedaytop.com/old-iphone-applications-executed-off-apple-ios-11/

Purists may shudder, but for those looking for fun new ways to do yoga, ita��s time to roll up your mats. Zorba – A Renaissance Studio has just introduced aerial yoga in the city (at their new Anna Nagar branch, which is also the only centre offering it in the South). a�?People may celebrate World Yoga Day, but most often they just learn a few things and then forget all about it.

Also called anti-gravity yoga, this form is practised using special silk hammocks suspended from the ceiling and can magnify the benefits of traditional yogaa��like increased power, strength and flexibilitya��by supporting the body during difficult asanas.
But Shashi warns that aerial yoga is not for everyone. a�?It requires high levels of fitness and knowledge of traditional asanas. Initially, we will take only four students for each class. And for beginners, we will teach them the traditional form before helping them progress to aerial yoga,a�? he assures, adding that the classes will be led by instructors who have been specially trained by him. Shashi also says that for a well-rounded fitness routine, people can take the yoga classes in conjunction with their new coursesa��Zumba (Rs 2,500 a month, three days a week) and Zorba Commando Towna��a routine that combines techniques from cross fit, aikido, kobudo, kick-boxing and karatea��available exclusively at the Anna Nagar outlet for now.

Cashing in on the human weakness for nostalgia and memories associated with food, Place Of Origin, a Bangalore-based start up is offering up everything from cherry Swiss cookies from the legendary Kolkata confectioners Flurys to spicy sev from Anand Namkeen, all the way from Indore. Started by Ashish Nichani who has worked in banking for six years, and Sudarsan Netla an IIT Guwahati and IIM Lucknow alumnus, in October 2014, the idea was born when the duo realised that people have a craving for authentic food that cannot be found at their local supermarket. a�?Whenever we travel, we bring back food that is special to that particular region because there is a lot of authenticity attached to it and people are willing to pay for that kind of authenticity,a�? explains Nichani, adding, a�?we have consciously avoided FMCG products as they can be bought anywhere. Our focus is strictly on gourmet and artisanal fare.a�?
What caught our eye though were products from Flurys, known for its European sweet treats including tea cakes, cookies and puddings. Choose from their plum cake, plain cake, double chocolate chip cookies or Swiss cherry cookies. We were also equally thrilled about Mumbaia��s Moshea��s a�� a chain of restaurants specialising in Mediterranean confectionery and baked goods including, chocolate caramel squares, French hearts and florentines.
And for those who are not really nostalgists, Place Of Origin offers plenty of modern snacking options such as vegan, bean-to-bar chocolates from Mason & Co (Auroville) and coffee from Flying Squirrel (Bangalore), among others. Nichani also says, a�?To ensure that our goods dona��t perish before they reach our customers, we stick to products that have a shelf life of seven days or above. You will find that 80 per cent of the products on Place Of Origin have a shelf life of three months or more. What we also do is make sure that retailers declare the expiry date on the packaging so customers can check if a particular products is safe to consume.a�?
While its sales until now were through its Facebook page, the website was recently launched. Servicing Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi as of now, Place Of Origin began services in Chennai just a few days ago.

Crotchety old uncles and aunts in Tamil households have a strange obsession. They pop up at all the wrong functions and ask all kinds of right questions to the wrong persons. One legendary query that has given many young generations the jitters is, a�?Yenna yaarunu theriyuda?a�? Translated that means a�?Dude, I know you dona��t give a fig about me. But let me embarrass you by asking you to name mea��although theoretically speaking, you dona��t stand a chance as the last time you saw me, you were in your nappy!a�?
I dona��t know about you, but every time someone asks me their name, I go blank. No amount of panic hitting of the a�?recall memorya�� button seems to help. The farthest Ia��ve gotten so far is remembering the first letter. I used to think that I had Alzheimera��s and the hypochondriac in me was secretly relishing the prospect of chewing some bitter new tablets. But apparently, forgetting names is a not that rare a disease. Ita��s as commonplace as the common cold. And the technical term for it is a�?Nominal Aphasiaa��.
Aphasia is a�?speechlessnessa�� and nominal aphasia is an apt way of describing how tongue-tied you feel while recollecting a name. Ita��s a very solvable problem if we take the effort to understand how the brain works. Essentially, the brain stores three types of memories: instant, short term and long term. Names are short term memories and they are filed in the long term folder only if they are associated with some other memory. Let me explain.
Suppose you meet someone named Rahul, chances are youa��re likely to forget it as ita��s not a�?memorablea�� enough. Because three other namesakes (Rahul Gandhi, Rahul Dravid and Rahul Bose) have already occupied some precious real estate in the inner labyrinths of the long term memory folder. To make space for another Rahul, you need a prefix or suffix that generates a visual in your head.
All we need to do is to learn from our forefathers and apply the right name marker. That way, the next time some pesky relative poses that infamous question, you can jog your memory instantly and run away with the honours.
Aarthi Varanasi kicked off her radio career with a private radio unit just around the phase two implementation of FM stations (over eight years ago). She had also attended a workshop of mine back then, where I noticed her hunger to learn, her attention to perfecting any lags and, most importantly, her love for the microphone. After a stint at Radio City and a sabbatical, she is now back on the air waves, hosting a show on Suryan FM in the breakfast time zone. A perfect mix of maturity and exuberance, hers is a voice that makes the soundscape vibrant. I caught up with Varanasi to find out more.
It has been fun and challenging. Hosting a totally new show, a breakfast show at that, is a dream come true for me. I am thoroughly enjoying this phase. When you love your work, the outcome is definitely very satisfying and positive.
Chennai Mail is the show I host (from 7- 9 am). Ita��s about infotainment and music. We begin the show on a positive note, speaking on health and local happenings. Each day, a Chennai-based issue or topic is discussed, with experts giving their opinions. We alsoA� invite callers to speak on the same.
I am a peoplea��s person. I am very talkative and this medium lets me do what I like and be who I am. Being a trained singer, music is my first love and with good music playing all the time, I can perform my job even better. Radio helps me connect with people and express myself. This connect gives me happiness, motivation and makes me feel this is where I belong and this is what I love doing.
Knowing fully well the power of the medium, I would like to voice and be part of social issues and good causes that require support and attention. I also want to play the best music and encourage new talent, keeping in mind the core of any stationa��the listener.
Catch Varanasi light up your mornings, every Monday to Saturday, on Suryan FM 93.5. See you next week.
The city was buzzing this week, with a line -up of events that would have presented a challenge even for the most dedicated of social butterflies. Which also means Ia��ll do my best to squeeze it at all in. Audi revealed their new Q3 across the country, with a simultaneous launch in Chennai and Bengaluru on Friday. Aimed at a younger crowd, the brand chose young achievers from each city to do the honours. Chennai saw actor-singer Andrea Jeremiah and racer Aditya Patel, with the former doing a good job of keeping the press on track, despite their curiosity about upcoming film projects. In Bangalore, the focus was even more so on the a�?younga�� aspect, with brand ambassadors chef Siddhanth Sawkar, singer-songwriter Soundariya Jayachandran and golf champ Sharmila Nicollet, who are 24, 21 and 23 years old, respectively. Talk about making the rest of us feel small. Post the unveiling, guests got to check out the car, along with a host of its special features.
The weekend also saw Gaslight, by the Madras Players in association with The Boardwalkers, at the Museum Theatre. Directed by Michael Muthu, the play commanded quite a turn out, despite the rains, and it was well worth it. Great performances along with fabulous sets and lighting, had the audience riveted throughout.

Yesterday we brought her to the vet. A new vet I might add, who was very good and actually has emergency appointments available. Who would have thought?!
It was so strange because it seemed like she was healing, but all of a sudden around 5 last evening, a check of her bum made us hustle to the vet clinic.
Since realising last Wednesday that Hermione's anal gland had ruptured Mr. K and I have been doing a twice daily, sometimes three times daily, routine of cleaning her anal glands and putting anti-biotic ointment on the area. She seemed to be getting better. Her energy was returning, her bum was wagging and her appetite had come back in full force. A check of the area Sunday evening put her in the clear. It looked good. However, last night I had a funny feeling and asked someone to look at it again.
Hermione had seemed fine earlier in the day and even when I had the funny feeling, she seemed pretty much herself; except that she was lying much closer to me than normal. You try not to read into these things. Anything could cause behaviour changes in your animals and since they can't tell you what's going on, you could drive yourself mad trying to interpret their every change. However, her body felt warm. Granted, it was a warm day and the house was pretty warm, but knowing that she was just barely out of the woods, I had her looked at.
Good thing I did because the area that had been free of redness and clean the night before was inflamed with one side of the gland appearing to be entirely red and hard and the other being covered with a clear film. It was apparently also bulbous. This was cause for alarm. We had been battling with this thing for over a week. It was time to go to the vet, and as I said above, a different one than our original one.
I called the vet and told them we'd be in very quickly. They are within walking distance and we arrived within 30 minutes of me calling. Hermione walked the whole way and was even excited about being out and about. It was a good thing that she was showing visible symptoms because judging by how she pranced along, you'd never know that she was fighting an infection.
The vet was a bit busy when we arrived, but Hermione was quickly weighed and then whisked off to have her bum looked after. Basically, they had to lance the area, flush it and then she'd be good to go. We warned the vet that Hermione was a drama queen, but not a biter. Strangely enough, Hermione didn't complain once. They gave her an anti-biotic injection that sits under the skin for two weeks and some pain killers. We were given some pain killers for home and instructed to give her one a day until they were gone. The vet said it was good we had brought her in because her temperature was slightly higher than normal. Even now I think her temperature is a bit high, but I think it's because the medicine is doing its job and she's fighting off the foreign bodies invading her little fuzziness.
On top of the pain killers we were also given a "cone of shame" for her to wear. She's a bit obsessive and keeping her from licking/chewing at the area has been difficult. With the collar though, she's not able to get to it at all. I do have to take it off of her when taking her out for bathroom breaks because she refuses to walk around with it on. She's such a particular little thing. At least she's getting rest since she refuses to go anywhere with the collar on. I have to be really vigilant when I take it off for bathroom breaks because she instantly attacks her butt.
So, Hermione's battle with problematic anal glands continues, but with the assistance of some strong drugs she should be back to normal soon. The vet said that the glands may be problematic for her for the rest of her life, but then again maybe not. If they continue to cause her issues, we may explore the option of having her anal glands removed. It's a risky surgery so there are a lot of things to consider. I had Jetta's glands removed in the first year of us working together. I didn't know then what I do now about diet, but you never know what will work. I thought Hermione's diet was suiting her and maybe it is. These glands can be tricky little things that really serve no purpose for the domesticated dog.
For now, I'll continue to feed Hermione her pureed pumpkin and blueberries and hope that she recovers quickly so that she can take the ridiculous collar off sooner rather than later.
Oh no :(. I'm sure that must be painful for her. Dogs can be very stoical things. I'm glad she is hopefully on the mends soon. Take care, xx

The phaleristic (and political) history of the UAE is made more complex by virtue of the fact that it is a loose confederation of seven States. The United Arab Emirates was established on 2 December 1971 through the confederation of seven coastal, previously semi-independent, British-protected emirates: Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Uum al-Qaywayn, Ras al-Khaimah (joining the federation only in 1972), and Fujairah. Each of these have their own awards, as does the UAE.
Awarded to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the confederation of the constituent emirates in 1971. Also described as the "1986 National Day Medal"?
Obverse: A 45-mm bronze star of dull and rather rough finish with ball points, resting on this a ten-pointed star, and, on this, a circle with the eagle of the U.A.E., surrounded by a wreath. Suspended by a straight bar suspender bearing the dates "1971-1986" (C.E.).
Awarded to U.A.E. troops which participated in the campaigns to liberate Kuwait in Gulf War II. The Emirates was the first Gulf state to propose combined military action to achieve the departure of Iraqi troops from Kuwait. Ultimately, Emirati troops participated in the liberation of Kuwait City.
Obverse: Gilt circular medal, 38 mm. Outline map of Kuwait with prominent rays behind. At the lower left the arms of the U.A.E. with the crest on the eagle's chest enemeled. Suspended by a ring.
Awards: As far as can be determined, the following Emirati participation can be traced: ground and air contingent in the G.C.C. "Peninsula Shield" force. In total, an estimated 1,497 Emiratian troops served in the war, of whom 6 were killed. None were recorded as wounded in combat.
The medal on the right is the U.A.E. Medal of Employee Distinction dating from 2009 - this award may be for Ministry of Interior staff but I am unsure.
The group of four medals from last years Bene Merenti auction are Palestinian and are the Order of Endurance of Beirut and date from the early 1980's when the PLO was forced to leave Lebanon for Tunisia. I am unsure as to whether they are trial or prooof pieces or were actually issued. I suspect they were not issued as there are two designs, different suspensions and ribbons.
Antonio, I am away from my research files but believe I summarised these medals in my fairly recent 4 part article in JOMSA on the awards of the UAE. I will be back in Riyadh by the end of the month so will be able to give details. Regards, Owain

It’s 12:00AM and just three hours before crawling out of bed to beat the sunrise to the water’s edge. Frustrated and tired, the one piece of clothing needed is no where to be found.
Sound familiar? The challenge to maximize available space and utilize it for saving time pays dividends. A good night’s rest and low stress is important for enjoying the most out of a fishing trip.
I’m always looking for something that can’t be found just before going fishing. I’ll admit it. So, I decided to find one space that could store all my fishing clothes. I also needed a way to quickly access small and large pieces in less than a minute, literally.
A company named Canopy manufactures a very useful hanging closet organizer that has a hook and loop attachment that wraps around a clothing bar. Three large shelves within the organizer allow for both warm and cold weather under and outer wear. Below are eight smaller boxes that store a surprising number of items to be at the ready when needed.
Those items I wear most and some that are hard to find will go into the organizer in the middle of the closet. Hanging to the right and left are jackets, long pants, or heavier shirts that I sometimes select based on weather or fishing conditions. This simple solution for organizing my clothes will go a long way toward a relaxed preparation for a great day of fishing.

Last Christmas I entered a writing contest upon viewing an ad. The winner was to be published in a second quarter print edition. I drafted an essay and submitted the paper by the New Years Eve deadline.
A week or so later I received an invitation from the publication to make a query for an upcoming edition. What a surprise! Upon inquiring to the Editor about the contest, he laughed and informed me there was none, but that I could consider myself the winner anyway! I had evidently submitted the entry to the wrong publication, or maybe not. Funny how things turn out sometimes.
Conservation ranks equal if not higher in my book, to that of fishing. In the early summer edition of Kayak Angler Magazine, I have the honor of sharing two conservation articles. I am thankful to have spent some time with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and one of the top tagging anglers in the country, Kayak Kevin Whitley, for developing content on the subject of fish tagging programs. Check it out on page 30. Also, on page 12, read how a small tarpon caught in Mobile Bay is big news for conservation.

Fly fishing with someone special can be a great experience. Introducing the sport to them can be a rewarding journey.
The 2004 fishing season was the third since introducing my wife, April, to fly fishing. She wasn’t sure if she had the coordination to cast a fly-line. But after practicing in the backyard, sitting through hours of Fly Fish TV, and being an enthusiastic listener, she became a quick study.
We decided to make a trip to the beautiful northern lower and upper peninsula’s of Michigan that season. The Black River near Bessemer, MI was our first destination. Bessemer is a ski town in the winter months, and an outdoor playground during the summertime. The Porcupine Mountains were the initial reason why we planned a week’s visit, but we quickly realized the Black River Scenic Area alone offered unique opportunities for activities and relaxation.
We stayed with Stan and Sue of the Black River Crossing Bed & Breakfast. Stan and Sue own a beautiful two story log cabin on the shore of the river. We woke to classical music and enjoyed a hearty breakfast every morning.
We were thankful for the local area knowledge Stan and Sue volunteered to share with us. We enjoyed hikes to many magnificent waterfalls along the Black River, and Powderhorn Creek. We kayaked the shore of Lake Superior, and found our first agates on pebble strewn beaches.
The kayak trip bears mentioning. Lake Superior lies on the north side of the Upper Peninsula. The lake is very large, deep, and that means cold. At the time I sit here writing this blog, Lake Superior water temperature rests at 48ºF along the shore nearby where we kayaked. On that July day, the water temp might have been in the low 50’s, but no higher. The trip was both our maiden voyage in a kayak, and April sat at the bow in our tandem paddle craft ready to enjoy a relaxing afternoon. We launched, and so did an incoming two foot roller, cresting the bow and into my brides lap. We learned lesson one in kayaking: Dress for water temperature, not air temps. It was cold trip for her, but an extra change of clothes from a friendly camping couple got us through, and we laugh about it today.
April and I after a refreshing first leg of a kayak trip along the very cold Lake Superior shoreline.
Among all the adventure, we managed to get in some fishing too. Upon making our first step into the river near the B&B, we were excited to see trout rising to Blue Winged Olives. Our success, or I should say April’s, came on a #16 pheasant tail nymph. April’s practice and study paid off by catching a Rainbow, Brown and finishing with a Brook trout to complete a hat trick in one evening! Impressive.
Later in the summer we went fishing with Jon Ray, Guide of Hawkins Outfitters. It was on this trip that April realized she had successfully trained muscle memory in her casting stroke. Jon worked with her during the trip on the Manistee River to make subtle improvements as we swung wet flies. April landed three nice trout including a very nice sixteen inch Brown. What a great season of experiencing the out of doors with someone I love so much.

How does aristotle's view of the forms differ from plato's he criticized the gap plato's idea leaves between the forms and the things they are the forms of: the 'chorismos' aristotle insisted that although we must believe in the forms or objective essences of things, they cannot be separated from those things. In the opinion of aristotle, the principle of imitation linking poetry with other arts and is the common basis of all the arts it is different to the category of fine arts from the other arts although plato equates poetry with painting, aristotle compares with the music. Abstract plato and aristotle argue that artist (demiurge) and poet imitate nature, thus, a work of art is a reflection of nature however, they have different views on the functions of imitation in art and literature.
Aristotle studied under plato and remained in his academy for 20 years in athens but left the academy after plato's death aristotle and plato had different philosophies about many subjects like justice and injustice, the function of humans, truth, the human soul, art, politics, etc. Aristotle's poetics can be read as a response to plato's attack on art aristotle (384-322 bce) was a student at plato's academy from the time he was seventeen until plato's death some twenty years later. If aesthetics is the philosophical inquiry into art and beauty (or a contemporary surrogate for beauty, eg aesthetic value), the striking feature of plato's dialogues is that he devotes as much time as he does to both topics and yet treats them oppositely art, mostly as represented by poetry, is. His art philosophy on the other hand played an efficient part in the historical development of aesthetics he was born in the city of stagira in macedonia he entered plato's academy (akademia) at the age of eighteen and became one of his pupils.
The views of the great philosopher aristotle are particularly important because the entire structure of his thought had an enormous and even dominant influence on the economic and social thought of the high and late middle ages, which considered itself aristotelian although aristotle, in the greek. Plato's student, aristotle, took a very different view of the arts as outlined in his own work, poetics he saw the arts, and especially mimesis, in poetry and theatre as a necessary event for the emotional education of the public. The allegory of the cave is one of the most famous passages in the history of western philosophy it is a short excerpt from the beginning of book seven of plato's book, the republicplato tells.
Plato's objections against poetry and aristotle's replies objection from philosophical point of view 1 art (painting, music and other fine arts) is an imperfect imitation of an imperfect imitation, twice removed from reality, hence a world of shadows and falsehood. Fundamental to the view of tragedy in plato and aristotle (and indeed for me) is the human need for pathos (suffering) pity (greek eleos) = compassion for the one undergoing the pathos terror/fear (greek phobos) = identification with the one undergoing the pathos. Reciprocity is not necessary to plato's view of love, for the desire is for the object (of beauty), than for, say, the company of another and shared values and pursuits many in the platonic vein of philosophy hold that love is an intrinsically higher value than appetitive or physical desire. David daiches summarizes aristotle's views in reply to plato's charges in brief: tragedy (art) gives new knowledge, yields aesthetic satisfaction and produces a better state of mind 3 plato judges poetry now from the educational standpoint, now from the philosophical one and then from the ethical one.
Aristotle and plato were philosophers in ancient greece who critically studied matters of ethics, science, politics, and more though many more of plato's works survived the centuries, aristotle's contributions have arguably been more influential, particularly when it comes to science and logical reasoning. Main here is aristotle's argument for the existence of god, from chapters 6 to 10 of book 12 of the metaphysics in chapter 6, aristotle argues that there must be some eternal and imperishable substance, otherwise all substance would be perishable, and then everything in the world would be perishable. Plato's and aristotle's view on art and what it represents pages 2 words 990 view full essay more essays like this: plato, aristotle, greek philosophers, view on art. Plato and aristotle essay the worlds two most famous philosophers- plato and aristotle- have influenced countless numbers of people through the ages they spoke and wrote about a variety of topics, including politics, science, and art. Plato argues for an assertion of knowledge as implied in the allegory, but aristotle contradicts this argument that the ideal or the 'good' is not otherworldly and unattainable but can be achieved through the direction of happiness in an individual's life.
Aristotle (b 384 - d 322 bce), was a greek philosopher, logician, and scientist along with his teacher plato, aristotle is generally regarded as one of the most influential ancient thinkers in a number of philosophical fields, including political theory. Plato and aristotle maintained that the honor must be given to those who have the knowledge of the good (agathon) in political competition, the best flute player must be the guy who got out of plato's cave and saw things in the bright day light. Plato plato's allegory of the cave is the key to understanding his view of the human condition in this allegory, the human condition is likened to being trapped in a cave facing the back wall, only able to see shadows and unaware that there is anything else in the world. In raphael's painting, the school of athens, plato and aristotle walk side by side at the center, with plato pointing up to signify his idealism and aristotle pointing down to signify his belief.
David daiches summarizes aristotle's views in reply to plato's charges in brief: tragedy (art) gives new knowledge, yields aesthetic satisfaction and produces a better state of mind plato judges poetry now from the educational standpoint, now from the philosophical one and then from the ethical one.
This is because aristotle showed a more realistic view of human nature than plato about the 'good life' therefore, it is evident that aristotle's solution to the problem of the 'good life' is a better answer than plato.
Aristotle's rhetoric is as the first rhetoric website, a site designed to describe public discourse with hundreds of links to other works written by aristotle, other treatises on rhetoric, contemporary oratory, drama, poetry, and other subjects.
Aristotle (384 - 322 bce) in the school of athens, the fresco by raphael on the home page of this web site, plato and aristotle stand side by sideplato points to the heavens, to the ideal world of the forms. Plato vs aristotle: compared philosophies undeniably, plato and aristotle are the two rock stars of greek philosophy plato created idealism and aristotle, later recuperated by thomas aquinas, became the official doctrine of the catholic church. A w price a w price is reader in philosophy at birkbeck college, london he has touched on the emotions in two books, love and friendship in plato and aristotle (clarendon press 1989/97), mental conflict (routledge 1995), and in a number of articles.

Full Video of Minister Farrakhan’s Nov. 8th press conference hosted at the Press TV headquarters in Tehran
Statement from the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan regarding his trip to Iran and message to Iran and America
My best lesson learned in life is not from my educational journey of obtaining three degrees, which required me to move across country three times, or from getting my heat broken or from getting a divorce, nor is it from my yearly journeys of participating in the month of Ramadan. My best lesson learned in life about love stems from losing my parents. My mother died in October 1996 and what a painful reality did I have to face, especially since after the funeral and the burial, I had to immediately go back to school to complete my last year of undergraduate work. Then, four years later, I was told in January 2000 that my father only had a year to live; and sure enough within three months of that following year, he died.
One would think that living life without both my parents, at any age, would be almost like an impossible journey. However, the lesson that I learned is not to wallow in the grief, the absence, the sorrow, the paralysis and the anger that one immediately feels. The most valuable lesson is to embrace the feelings of hurt, but not to stay there. Now, of course, one may ask, what do I mean? Yes, I understand. As I have experienced, not once but twice, I learned that the peace of mind can come once one truly submits to it. Once I stopped reading those self help books on grief and bereavement; and I positively focused on the wonderful memories that I had of the beautiful human beings that God allowed to conceive me, I was instantly at peace and my sad face turned into a smile. This is also when the healing process began. Now of course there were some days, where all I wanted to do was cry, so when one feels compelled to do such, do it. Yet, one cannot stay there. It is the sweet and pleasant loving memories of my parents that keeps them alive and remains at the forefront of my mind. Part of this epiphany or revolting revelation came from my readings of Toni Morrison’s book: Beloved, along with my analysis of her nonfiction works and her explanations about writing her novels. For example, in the essay, “The Site of Memory” Toni Morrison writes “First of all, I must trust my own recollections. I must also depend on the recollection of others.” It is the act of rememory, this communal or collective ability to recall or to remember a previous experience, a significant moment in time or a person is the life force that also allows one cope with the loss of a loved one.
While, I still miss my parents deeply, I don’t stay there, because I can find so much joy in talking with others about my parents or in looking at pictures of my parents or in visiting New York City (NYC), my hometown. When I go back to NYC, I always revisit the places where I spent time with my parents: Central Park, Bloomingdales, Saks Fifth Avenue, Muhammad’s Mosque Number 7, the Schomberg Library, Lincoln Center, Harlem School of the Arts, Dance Theater of Harlem and the list goes on. I even find myself eating some of their favorite types of foods or places to eat, like Indian Food (My Dad and I always had our father-daughter chats at this Indian spot in Harlem), Jamaican Food (My Mommie loved Cod Fish Cakes) or Veneros Bakery in the Village (My parents bought me a strawberry shortcake for my birthday until I was sixteen). Lastly, I am also reminded of my parents when someone walks pass me and/or I smell Jean Paul Gaultier (my father’s cologne of choice before he died) or White Linen (one of my mother’s favorite scents).
Surely, the desire to see them again, to hear their voices again, and to touch them again are fleeting moments, just like seeing them again in a dream, but one must not stay there. It is in the various modes of rememory that one can be fulfilled, find solace and have healthy embrace of this parental absence. Life will be more meaningful in their absence if one can positively draw from all that one’s parents has given them and will continue to offer them, as long as one can find strength in remembering.

#repost from @louisfarrakhan - Statement regarding my trip to Iran and message to Iran and America.⠀ ⠀ TEHRAN, Iran- I am not and have never been an enemy to America, nor the people of America. However, I love America enough to speak unpleasant truths that are in the best interests of an erring nation that perhaps she may change her conduct and course. I have an abiding love for the right to free speech, the right to a free press and the right every human being has to hear the truth. It is only truth spoken in season that can bring us what we desire of freedom, justice, equality and, ultimately, peace.⠀ ⠀ I was invited to Tehran University to speak to students and engage in a dialogue with Iranian students. I was also invited to meet with other members of Iranian society for discussions about their concerns for their nation and concerns about world affairs, in particular the sanctions placed on Iran by President Donald Trump and his advisors.⠀ ⠀ I never led a chant that called for the death of America or Israel, contrary to misreporting in U.S., British and Jewish publications and the intentional, malicious and false reinterpretation of my words. There is nothing more important than truth today. The truth of anyone and anything is enough to condemn any individual or institution. But to make media mischief by altering my words from their places is a betrayal of the right to free speech, the blessing of a free press and a violation of the people’s right to know. It is wrong and shameful that journalists and news organizations that should seek the truth would traffic in such lies.⠀ ⠀ I never led a chant calling for death to America. To say otherwise is a blatant falsehood and an attempt to paint me as an enemy in a very dangerous time as tension rises between America and Iran and nations around the earth reject unjust sanctions and heavy-handed U.S. foreign policy. ⠀ ⠀ //Full statement link in bio.// #Farrakhan #Iran #Tehran

In the refrigeration cycle, heat is transported from a colder location to a hotter area. As heat would naturally flow in the opposite direction, work is required to achieve this. A refrigerator is an example of such a system, as it transports the heat out of the interior and into its environment. The refrigerant is used as the medium which absorbs and removes heat from the space to be cooled and subsequently ejects that heat elsewhere.
Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it’s tight. If it’s not, remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you’ve swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).
HVAC pros are busy, especially in the summer. Just because you need an AC repair right now, that does not mean an HVAC pro will be available. Additionally, if they are free, your cost to repair the AC unit just went up. Emergency situations call for changes in schedules, surprise road trips and many other sudden situations. As such, air conditioning contractors tend to charge more.
Fast forward 1 year and 1 week and the circuit board that HVAC Service had installed has failed again. They came out and said that it failed from water condensation dripping onto it, so we needed to replace it and reroute the pipes to prevent future water damage. That would cost double what I paid last year. Why didn't they fix the problem last year at the initial repair instead of putting in a circuit board that was bound to fail again?!? They were strongly recommending that the furnace be completely replace for a huge fee to avoid the same thing happening again. I paid $59 for them to tell me they didn't fix it right last year. This didn't feel right, so I sought a second opinion. I'm very glad that I found another guy to come replace the circuit board and put it away from the water, fix the water leak, and also find and fix another impending failure. All of that was for much less than HVAC Service wanted to charge for repair or replacement. The other guy did a great repair, so I'm confident it will not break down again, but if it does, I will not call HVAC Service. Don't get suckered by their Yelp Deal.
I originally took off one star because of the SNAFU with getting the part ordered. When Alberto called me on the phone he admitted the person had "gotten busy with other things" and apologized. THAT was taking the high road and I was impressed by that. Sadly, for reasons I won't guess at, Alberto has decided to take the low road in his comments and imply that they got the part as quickly as possible. Well, we called at 2:30 so did someone spend six and a half hours finding the part?? That seems very doubtful. As for the price I think my review was fair in stating what value we got for what I deemed to be a slightly higher price than others might charge. I did not take any stars off for the price, and still am not, but I am taking another star off because of Alberto's comments, which are deceptive and not the same thing he told me in person. Alberto, I suggest you stick with the high road in the future.
Reinstall the access panel and disconnect block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to start (see “Be Patient at Startup,” below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor starts but the fan doesn’t, the fan motor is most likely shot. Shut off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (photo 7). Reinstall the blade and secure the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan starts. If it doesn’t, you’ve given it your best shot—it’s time to call a pro.

A contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so. Unscrew the old contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (photo 6).

Air conditioning (often referred to as AC, A/C, or air con)[1] is the process of removing heat and moisture from the interior of an occupied space, to improve the comfort of occupants. Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is most commonly used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans and animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool/dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as computer servers, power amplifiers, and even to display and store some delicate products, such as artwork.
If your air conditioner isn’t cooling, or is experiencing another performance issue, shut it off. Don’t continue to operate a malfunctioning air conditioner, as that may worsen the problem at hand. This is one reason we do preventative maintenance checks pre-season – a technician identifies and corrects problems, so you don’t run your system with faulty components, causing more damage.
A specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier. It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.

Before we get into the different AC repairs and replacements that John Moore offers, it’s important to understand the basic operating principles of your AC system. There are two types of systems: electric and natural gas. Electric AC systems use an air handler to blow air through your home while natural gas systems use a furnace. Both furnaces and air handlers are typically located in the attic.
As for parts prices, we are a business and factor in profit and overhead into our pricing structure, and frequently research other companies to be sure we are competitive, which we are. Jody, you did not pay $400 for labor, you paid $489 for a flat rate repair which included, travel, labor, diagnostics, parts, tax, shipping, truck charge, fuel charge, overtime rate, profit and overhead. As for the time of the actual repair, if it had taken 2 or 3 hours the cost would have still been the same $489.

Modern air conditioning systems are not designed to draw air into the room from the outside, they only recirculate the increasingly cool air on the inside. Because this inside air always has some amount of moisture suspended in it, the cooling portion of the process always causes ambient warm water vapor to condense on the cooling coils and to drip from them down onto a catch tray at the bottom of the unit from which it must then be routed outside, usually through a drain hole. As this moisture has no dissolved minerals in it, it will not cause mineral buildup on the coils. This will happen even if the ambient humidity level is low. If ice begins to form on the evaporative fins, it will reduce circulation efficiency and cause the development of more ice, etc. A clean and strong circulatory fan can help prevent this, as will raising the target cool temperature of the unit's thermostat to a point that the compressor is allowed to turn off occasionally. A failing thermistor may also cause this problem. Refrigerators without a defrost cycle may have this same issue. Dust can also cause the fins to begin blocking air flow with the same undesirable result: ice.
Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant (typically water or a glycol mix) from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes, equipped with heat exchanger. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.
You can keep your air conditioner running efficiently with some preventative care measures. Shut off the power to your AC before cleaning it or performing any of these tasks:  clean your filter at least twice a year; remove leaves and twigs from cages; clean the fins with a garden hose or special spray, then use a butter knife to straighten any that are crooked; keep your yard clean so the fins won't get blocked; cover the unit up for winter; and make sure it's level or you run the risk of damaging the inner workings of the unit.

Modern air conditioning emerged from advances in chemistry during the 19th century, and the first large-scale electrical air conditioning was invented and used in 1902 by England inventor Willis Carrier. The introduction of residential air conditioning in the 1920s helped enable the great migration to the Sun Belt in the United States.[citation needed]
While most people know the consequences of heating system problems throughout the winter, the season comes with its own set of unique concerns that require a call to the plumber. The most received calls we take during these months are for frozen pipes, broken water lines and failing water heaters. We’ve been through it all. And with 24/7/365 Emergency Plumbing Service from Service Experts, you don’t have to be worried about any of it. When you need a plumber, we are here for you. Plus, just like all of our other services and products, any plumbing repair or work completed by Service Experts is covered by a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee*.
In addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the latent heat of vaporization). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an evaporative cooler, and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier always will warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water.
The most important maintenance task that will ensure the efficiency of your air conditioner is to routinely replace or clean its filters. Clogged, dirty filters block normal airflow and reduce a system's efficiency significantly. With normal airflow obstructed, air that bypasses the filter may carry dirt directly into the evaporator coil and impair the coil's heat-absorbing capacity. Replacing a dirty, clogged filter with a clean one can lower your air conditioner's energy consumption by 5% to 15%.

A multi-split system[44] is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioner there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units located in the room.

Air duct cleaning is done by heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) professionals. The pros use industrial-strength, truck-mounted vacuums and powerful brushes and hoses to clean inside the metal ducts that make up your forced air heating and cooling system. The Environmental Protection Agency recommends duct cleaning if there is “substantial visible mold growth inside hard surface ducts, ducts that are infested with vermin such as rodents or insects, or ducts that are clogged with excessive amounts of dust and debris and/or particles are actually released into the home from your supply registers.”

Advantages of the ductless system include smaller size and flexibility for zoning or heating and cooling individual rooms. The inside wall space required is significantly reduced. Also, the compressor and heat exchanger can be located farther away from the inside space, rather than merely on the other side of the same unit as in a PTAC or window air conditioner. Flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior one(s); these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof. In addition, ductless systems offer higher efficiency, reaching above 30 SEER.[39]
An HVAC service contract can be a very cost-effective way to make sure your system is properly maintained and to have someone on call when things go wrong. Depending on the amount of services offered, they cost between $150 and $500 per year, but they often include yearly inspections of both your furnace and A/C, discounts on major repairs, and preferred scheduling status when you have problems during the busy season.
The myth that most people believe is that if you add more refrigerant to the unit it will cool better. This is only true if the evaporator coil is operating below freezing. The unit must have a balanced charge at the correct refrigerant pressure for the temperature and usually, only an HVAC professional can charge your unit properly. Another misconception about refrigerant is that the unit burns it up and it must be replaced from time to time. This is not true. Furthermore, the refrigerant loop is a closed system and barring any leaks the air conditioning system should never need any refrigerant.
As an Atlanta resident, you’re well aware that the weather in our area can go through extremes of both hot and cold throughout the year, taxing your heating and cooling system to its limits. You’ll likely encounter the need for repair or replacement at some point. If you need HVAC installation, HVAC maintenance, or HVAC service and repair, R.S. Andrews is the most trusted name in Atlanta.

We'll take on any job in the Alpharetta and Woodstock, Georgia areas, from filter changeouts in single-family homes to complete HVAC overhauls in large commercial properties.
Many disconnect blocks contain two cartridge fuses. Check them before you proceed with repairs (Photo 3). A blown fuse is a sign of a failing part inside the condensing unit. So don’t just replace it and think you’ve solved the problem. Instead, replace the parts we show here. Then install new fuses and fire up the unit. If it blows again, call a pro—you’ve got more serious issues.
Tony from HVAC came out on Sunday morning and did a fantastic job of immediately diagnosing the issue, quickly fixing the problem, and honoring the coupons I had. When I initially called on Saturday morning, I had a lot of trouble with their answering service getting their wires crossed with their technicians. However, Tony called me back and made it right. He even pointed out an issue that is in the horizon that I should look at (without charging me extra or telling me I had to fix it right now). Great service!
Beyond changing the air filter on a regular basis, one of the best ways to ensure your home's HVAC system is operating at peak efficiency is to have a qualified professional HVAC contractor tune up the system on a biannual basis. Energy Star recommends scheduling your system tune-up around the beginning of daylight savings time in the fall and its end in the spring. It's an easy way to remember to have your system serviced before the peak heating and cooling seasons. A standard tune-up is likely to cost you between $70 and $100, but it's money well spent.
Please note: this is a review from someone who never got service from here. They just chose to ignore my calls for a heating emergency. Who knows, they might have give great service, if they actually return a promised phone call. I actually call them this past Saturday night. It was chilly, we turned the furnace on...... Poof.... Nothing. So, I look them up on Yelp. Good reviews with a few bad goods added, plus a Yelp deal. I gave them a call, the at about 6 pm. I know, 6pm on a Saturday, who's going to come out, well, they did. They woman, I assume their receptionist, answers and I told her I need someone out here. She assured me someone will call me back in 15 mins. Half hour to 45 mins later, no calls from them. I figured maybe they wrote the number down wrong, it happens. So, I called them again. They got the number correct, got my name and address correct, and was told they will call me back in 10 mins. I even asked if this is something they don't do, as in services on a Saturday night. I was told by the receptionist that they do and I would just be ok calling another company if they is not part of their services. They again assured me someone WILL call me in 10 mins. Well, unless their definition of 10 mins is never, then they got it wrong as I am still waiting to be called 5 days later.
The belt should slip right into place. If it seems to be too tight or difficult to set in place, it may be necessary to adjust the motor mount to provide more slack. Then you can re-tighten the tension once the belt is in place. Check the manufacturer’s specifications for proper tension—in most cases, the belt should deflect about an inch when you press down on it.

It basically involves fine tuning the content of your site along with the HTML and Meta tags and also involves appropriate link building process. The most popular search engines are Google, Yahoo, MSN Search, AOL and Ask Jeeves. Search engines keep their methods and ranking algorithms secret, to get credit for finding the most valuable search-results and to deter spam pages from clogging those results.
A search engine may use hundreds of factors while ranking the listings where the factors themselves and the weight each carries may change continually. Algorithms can differ so widely that a webpage that ranks #1 in a particular search engine could rank #200 in another search engine. New sites need not be "submitted" to search engines to be listed. A simple link from a well established site will get the search engines to visit the new site and begin to spider its contents. It can take a few days to even weeks from the referring of a link from such an established site for all the main search engine spiders to commence visiting and indexing the new site.
If you are unable to research and choose keywords and work on your own search engine ranking, you may want to hire someone to work with you on these issues.
Search engine marketing and promotion companies, will look at the plan for your site and make recommendations to increase your search engine ranking and website traffic. If you wish, they will also provide ongoing consultation and reporting to monitor your website and make recommendations for editing and improvements to keep your site traffic flow and your search engine ranking high.

- Corrected an issue causing the character's total AC value to display somewhat higher than it should for most classes. The AC value on your Persona window will now accurately reflect your character's overall defensive rating.
- Higher level group members will no longer take a disproportionately large share of group experience splits.
- The blue/green range for players in their low 20s is now significantly larger, allowing them to hunt in some of their favorite spots for longer.
- Fixed a rounding error that caused the displayed weapon delay value to be off by 0.1 in some cases. No items were changed, and the actual delay of your weapon has not been affected. This was a display bug only.
Guild advancement is coming along nicely, thanks to those who contribute status points. We'll add a post detailing status points for those of you who may not understand exactly how that works, but at 25000 and climbing, we're making excellent progress. I know a few of us are making a pretty dedicated attempt at not levelling at all outside of Guild Writs, which were just introduced in the last week for tradeskill classes.

We would like to find someone who genuinely cares about animals (and plants), and who is neat and tidy and a non-smoker, to look after our 12 month old (indoor)
At Chubbs’ school they celebrate 100′s Day. This is the 100th day of the school year, and they do all kinds of stuff dealing with the number 100. It’s been pushed back a few days this year because of the weather, but that was good for us so we had plenty of time to work on her poster. Her assignment was to bring a poster with 100 things on it. We thought about it, and came up with her ’100 Favorites’. We had a brainstorming session to come up with 10 different categories, then 10 items in each category. This project became a ‘Mommy Nightmare’. We don’t buy magazines, so I didn’t have an abundance for her to cut from. We ended up going online to find most of the pictures. I spent an entire evening saving pictures to my computer, uploading them to snapfish, and making them into collages so we could pick them up from Walgreens, cut them out and attach to the poster. Well, Walgreens wouldn’t print my collages because I didn’t have rights to all the pictures. My fault for not knowing that, but I was furious anyway. So, on to plan B…hook up the photo printer & print them off myself. After a frustrating hour of trying to get the photo printer to do something other than growl and flash lights at me, we moved on to plan C…use a friend’s printer. That worked, although the pages got progressively worse as printing went on since they were almost out of ink. At that time, I was to the point of ‘Who cares!? It’s going on the stinking poster!’ I spent another few hours helping cut and glue everything on. She hand wrote the labels, drew pictures of a few things that didn’t make the printing cut, I got to use my Cricut to make the letters for her title, we glued on some marshmallows, cinnamon stick, a vanilla bean, and voilà!
Big Puppy called me on his way to work to let me know that she was positively glowing walking into school with her poster. I am so pleased with the way it came out, and that she is proud of it. She worked very hard on it, and we did have a lot of fun…minus the printing issues.
At least once a year, I watch all six Thin Man movies. It is my own little festival. I have a comfortable chair and a relatively large flat screen TV in my small apartment in San Francisco. I am the only festival attendee, so it’s just me and a bottle of Cabernet. I don’t come to this subject with any particular expertise, no deep knowledge of Dashiell Hammett. It’s as much nostalgic as anything else. When I was young these films were on the late-night movies that followed the local news. A shamelessly self-promoting Indianapolis used car salesman who called himself “The King” hosted the program. He stood in front of a blackboard (as high-tech as it got in those days) slashing prices on various automobiles as he yelled, “The King don’t care.” Then we would go back to a grainy but charming Nick and Nora Charles and that wonderful blend of suspense and comedy, bright wit and dark shadows, the high life and the low life. If that wasn’t the birth of my love for private eye stories, it certainly enhanced it. Such was the life of the young me in a hide-a-bed, with the black and white television flashing noirish shadows on the wall.
This little festival of mine seems particularly appropriate as we usher in 2013 (Year of the Snake, incidentally). A book of the previously unpublished Thin Man stories written by Hammett has just been published by Mysterious Press —Return of The Thin Man. What some might not know is that The Thin Man was the last novel Hammett wrote. That lone book was the basis for the popular film that launched five sequels, none of which were based on novels. However, as we discover now in this new book, he did write two pieces, the editors call “novellas,” that relate to the next two Thin Man films, After The Thin Man and Another Thin Man. My guess is that these pieces weren’t meant as standalone anything, but rather as story maps for the studio to take advantage of the popularity of the first film to create a franchise. There was money to be made for everyone at a time when it was difficult to make money. The book’s editors, Richard Layman and Julie M. Rivett, imply this. The Hammett novellas are essentially treatments. Fascinating nonetheless.
For some, the editors’ introduction to the two short pieces will add to our understanding of this stage of Hammett’s life. Surely the Continental Op was most reflective of the famous author’s early Pinkerton days. And Spade was a loner. Nick, on the other hand, had found his Nora when he embarked on The Thin Man. And it doesn’t take a genius to see how Dashiell Hammett and his relationship with Lillian Hellman, however fictionalized and idealized it might be, inspired the hard partying, devil may care Nick and Nora idea. The editors also reveal the studio, writer, actor relationships, including the contributions made by the great screen writing team of Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett as well as director W. S. Van Dyke, the people responsible for the first three, and possibly best Thin Man films.
The year 2013 is also the year The Thin Man was to be remade, though it may not happen. Johnny Depp, who was to play Nick, has a complicated life — all sorts of projects and apparent personal issues. The remake was to go into production in November, I read, after Depp wrapped up his new and apparently expensive Lone Ranger film. It could still happen. The search is still on for an actress to play Nora. Another thought, perhaps a descendant of Eddie, from the TV sit-com “Frasier” could play Asta. After all, the real Asta was a schnauzer, not a wirehair fox terrier as the dog is portrayed in all six films. So what would be wrong with a Jack Russell terrier taking he part? This is Hollywood.
If you want to have your own festival, here are the Nick and Nora Charles films in the order they were made, noting that Hammett had decreasing influence on the final cut and virtually none for the last couple.
The Thin Man — This is the one that started them all, the one based on an actual Dashiell Hammett novel and made William Powell as Nick Charles and Myrna Loy as Nora Charles one of America’s favorite film couples. The film has a Christmas-New Year’s holiday theme, though I’m happy to say, it’s in the background. Maureen O’Sullivan plays the only sane member of a crazy family and a young and debonair Cesar Romero plays a gigolo. What else? The film is a fantastic reflection of the times. We get a glimpse of post-depression, post-prohibition 1934.
After The Thin Man — This is one of my favorites. One of the reasons is that the lovely couple return to San Francisco and also because it takes place on New Years Eve. Perfect for tonight. Jimmy Stewart co-stars. Look for the usual brawls, a few red herrings, a great nightclub in Chinatown, and glimpse of the city’s bustling Market Street of 1936.
Another Thin Man — Baby makes three. Sheldon Leonard plays the heavy in this film set in Manhattan and Long Island. A creaky old mansion and creaky old people, says the creaky blogger, as well an elaborately designed murder and a slew of petty ante gangsters inhabit the whodunit. Watch for the big production number.
Shadow Of The Thin Man — We’re back in San Francisco and off to the races. Donna Reed, Stella Adler and Barry Nelson are in the cast of this mystery featuring such characters as Spider Web and Rainbow Benny (they may be the same person, I’m not sure). Pay attention to the wrestling match scene. Nice twist at the end. This time the big brawl is at an Italian restaurant at Fisherman’s Wharf.
The Thin Man Goes Home — Maybe because it’s the small town backdrop. Maybe it’s because Nick has given up his martinis for apple cider and it seems to have turned him into Ozzie Nelson. Whatever the cause, this is my least favorite. While all the films offer some wonderful silliness, this one just seems contrived without redemption of a knowing wink. If you had to cut one from this list, this would be it. Otherwise, it’s worthwhile just to know you saw them all.
Song Of The Thin Man — It’s nice the series didn’t end on a low note. This one bounces back. New producers, directors and writers. Though the last couple of films were only based on “characters created by Dashiell Hammett,” this one finds the formula. The film also benefits from a great supporting cast that includes one of my favorites from the “B” picture cast of characters, Gloria Grahame, plus Keenan Wynn, Jane Meadows, and a very young Dean Stockwell as Nick and Nora’s son. We are treated with ‘40s jazz, a floating casino and nightclub (Shades of Mr. Lucky), wet, foggy nights, and a telltale necklace. One of the pleasures is to see the stylish couple thirteen years after the first film, still elegant, still funny.
If you are so inclined, think about a Thin Man Weekend Festival. Light-hearted, celebratory and certainly old lang syne.
What do you do when people get in the way of your happiness and your ambition? You kill them, of course. Graham Marshall (Michael Caine) discovers this easy solution by accident when an angry, physically intimidating homeless man in a subway demands respect. Perhaps this hits too close. Respect was what he wasn’t getting at home or at work. The vagrant, an obvious failure in Marshall’s eyes, won’t go away. A train and a little shove, not intended to kill — though it did — and poof, problem solved. Now, on to other problems, larger, more irritating problems at home and at work.
In Shock to the System, based on the novel by Simon Brett, Caine plays an understated Don Draper, a man trying to advance in an advertising firm full of duplicitous, ass kissing executives. The first death seems to light the way to the a dormant gene in Mr. Marshall’s constitution. He didn’t know he, who seemed to have a relatively mild, plodding personality, actually possessed the mind of a cold-blooded manipulator. He not only discovered this hidden talent, but now delighted in exercising it. The cast — Elizabeth McGovern, Swoosie Kurtz and Will Patton — is solid, and the small, smart story is told well. Is it possible to eliminate so many obstacles and not get caught? We shall see.
Michael Caine makes so many films, he has to make some of them twice. Sleuth is based on Anthony Shaffer’s award winning play. In the 1972 film, Caine played the younger of two characters in what turns out to be a deadly pissing match. Lawrence Olivier played the older man, attempting to recover from the humiliation he felt at the theft his wife’s heart. In 2007, the film was remade and updated, this time with Caine as the aging crime writer and Jude Law as the young actor or hairdresser (we’re not quite sure), who proves to be surprisingly adept at countering the sophisticated writer’s capricious, seemingly deadly moves.
What we have here is a stylish, mannered and fascinating two-person play in a stunning high-tech home, the third star of the film. Harold Pinter wrote the screenplay and Kenneth Branagh directed. Watching a cerebral and cunning Caine and a clever and outrageous Law going at each other is as good as it gets, a genuine championship bout.
Scotch would work as an accompaniment to the evening. Martinis are probably too American for either film. This is a British battle. By the way, both films, especially the claustrophobic Sleuth, work well on home screens.
As cold weather approaches, this might be the time to entertain a couple of politically challenging films set where perspiration is more likely than goose pimples and a dramatic glimpse into recent history provokes thoughts about how our actions in foreign lands are more serious than we might think. What does our government do when we’re not paying attention?
The Year of Living Dangerously tells the story of an Australian journalist (Mel Gibson) who arrives in Indonesia during increasing public unrest, which finally results in the overthrow of its corrupt President Sukarno. The question pits a hungry, get-the-scoop journalist against understanding the deeper issues that affect a population being undermined by its leaders. Not too incidentally, he must choose between his career and the woman he loves. Tough choices. Linda Hunt gives her academy award performance as a young male dwarf concerned about the victims of corrupt leadership and Sigourney Weaver is the woman in the ambitious reporter's life. The steamy, smart sexy, adventurous film directed by Peter Weir was released in 1982. It was based on the book by Christopher Koch.
The parallels between this film and the film of Graham Greene’s The Quiet American are worth noticing. Director Phillip Noyce initially wanted to do The Year of Living Dangerously before losing out to Weir. Here, we have CIA intervention in the affairs of 1950s Vietnam while the French were struggling with colonizing it, all supposedly part of domino theory that would again raise its ugly head in the 1960s with the U.S. trying to get rid of the “red menace.”
In this case, Michael Caine plays a cynical journalist posted to Saigon during the French occupation. The U.S., which escaped culpability in Weir’s version of the Sukarno affair, doesn’t fair so well in The Quiet American. In fact, this is a remake. The first film, (1958) starring American war hero Audie Murphy, was virtually disowned by Greene as an American propaganda film. This one (2002) was more faithful to Greene’s intent. When we meet Brendan Fraser’s character, we believe he is an innocent do-gooder, a contrast to the older, wizened character played by Caine. Things, we learn, aren’t always what they seem and right and wrong, as it is in both movies, aren’t necessarily easy to discern. The idea of “collateral damage” is brought up here and is just as serious and controversial today as are CIA dirty tricks. Both films have, a their heart, both doing right on a deeply personal level with those we love and doing right for a cause greater than ourselves. And when are abominable acts justified in order to achieve a so-called greater good? Do Thi Hai Yen is the beautiful Vietnamese woman who symbolizes both the personal and the universal.
These are two perfect films for those who love history and politics mixed with a little steamy sex. And if cold, gray winter has descended on your household, take a trip to places closer to the equator. Turn up the heat and drink something that requires ice and a lime or a lemon.
When I created Life Death & Fog Books, I did so on a shoestring budget. The point was to reissue earlier works my publisher had no interest in and shorter works that couldn’t find a market because they were short. My goal was not to skimp on quality, whether that applied to the story, editing or design. But I could not afford to print thousands of books and store them, risk their return unsold, or incur shipping expense. So I worked with talented book designers who would do the work on spec with the idea of sharing in whatever profit was made. Amazon was willing to print on demand and distribute the trade paperbacks and ebooks. No upfront costs. If there had been, I couldn’t have done it.
But what that did, of course, was bypass bookstores. And bookstores, to the extent they were aware of my existence anyway, hadn’t been happy with me, because the publisher who picked up new books in the Shanahan series and the first two Lang/Paladino books, had a “no return” policy on hardbacks. I understood Severn House’s position. It was, after all and for all practical purposes, my position with my small publishing company. I also understood why bookstores didn’t order the hardbacks. I wouldn’t either. It was an unnecessary risk. There was nothing I could do about either situation. Yet, much like the bookstores, I wanted to stay in business. That meant getting my books out there as best I could.
The situation was uncomfortable. I am an avid bookstore customer. I have visited every San Francisco bookstore, new and used, and have written about them here in an effort to get the word out. I buy most of my books at a couple of my favorite independent bookstores in the city — and did so before Borders and B&N closed in San Francisco — and feel really good when I visit and the aisles are crowded and the stores are buzzing. That makes me feel even guiltier when I promote my e-books on-line.
I am happy to report that last August, Kobo announced it would work with independent bookstores in a revenue sharing program that would allow those stores to provide e-books and e-book readers to their customers. You can find a complete list of independent bookstores and another list of mystery bookstores by clicking the appropriate icon on the right side of this blog.
When my most recent book Death in the Haight was published by Dutton’s Guilt-Edged Mysteries in a recent re-launch of that imprint by Penguin, the novella was made available on Kobo as are the others from Dutton’s new line. Perhaps this is the kind of thing that will bridge the unfortunate gap created between struggling midlist writers and independent bookstores as both try to adjust to the tumultuous changes in the marketplace.

Sam Spade worked out of San Francisco. Marlowe was based in LA. Spenser operated in Boston. Mike Hammer and many other fictional private eyes went about their business in the nation’s largest metropolis, New York. It wasn’t until Albert Samson came along that Indianapolis had a gumshoe of its own. In fact, many credit Samson’s creator, long acclaimed novelist Michael Z. Lewin, as a pioneer in a movement that gave “regional private eyes” a national presence.
With no small amount of self-interest, I’m proposing that Indianpolitans who like detective novels explore the fictional sleuths who made their city home. In addition to the story telling in a place that might be especially familiar to the reader, there is a bit of the city’s history embedded in each book. While there are other writers who have set mysteries and thrillers in the Circle City, I believe there are only three of us who have created a series private eye protagonist in this setting.
Recent Private Eye Writers of America’s Shamus award winner Lewin’s first Samson novel, Ask the Right Question, was published in 1971. I found my paperback copy of The Way We Die Now the other day as I went through a stack of books in a vain attempt to dematerialize. The book was first released in 1973. So, I’m able to visit my hometown in a way that my faulty memory won’t allow and see vividly, in some cases, the places Samson visits. One senses that Samson is the kind of P.I. who actually exists. The stories and the characters are believable. There are eight novels in this highly acclaimed series, the most recent Eye Opener, which has been made available in e-book format. Many of his earlier Samson novels are no doubt available at your local mystery bookstore and a few are, fortunately, becoming available in electronic formats. There is a great article on Samson on the Thrilling Detective web site, which also points out that Lewin has written other, standalone novels and has two other series. But the Samson novels are an especially great idea for a holiday gift for the reader in your family, especially if he or she has a special affection for the city.

“Michael Lewin has just about the best private detective who has been around in many a day…Lewin has brains and style.” — Los Angeles Times
My first P.I. novel, Stone Veil was published in 1990. The book introduced a blue-collar, semi-retired, former Army intelligence sergeant turned P.I. After settling down in Indianapolis, Deets Shanahan meets the love of his life in a massage parlor and the two of them appear, along with a regular cast of characters, in ten novels so far, with the most recent being Bullet Beach in 2011, when in a time-defying fashion he finally turned 70. He is not so much tough as he is stubborn. To get a look at the city in the ‘90s, take a look at the early Shanahans, which have been reissued as trade paperbacks and ebooks. Restaurants, neighborhoods, bars, some of which may be gone now, remain in spirit as ink on a page or light shining up from a screen. A few are out of print, but many are still available. You might find, for example, Nickel-Plated Soul and Asphalt Moon in the backroom of your favorite bookstore. All the early Shanahans are available as e-books and in trade paperback. And your local bookstore can order the latest, Bullet Beach.
The new guy in the city arrived with a bang as well as lots of blood. Frank Behr is a super tough ex-cop, with a tragic past, who takes on the toughest of the tough on the darkest of the streets of Indianapolis. Levien, a screenwriter with plenty of credentials, has four books so far in the Behr series, City of the Sun, Where the Dead Lay, The Contract, and The 13 Million Dollar Pop. His books, which I think feature a kind of super-big, super-hero protagonist similar to the Jack Reacher model have received a number of award nominations and sell a lot of copies.
Because we’re entering the last gasps of holiday shopping and there are many desperate folks seeking a quick solution. How about a sampling of novels featuring fictional Indianapolis private eyes? Pick one or two from each author.
The stories are all over the Internet. The film, Killing Them Softly, “bombed.” It only made $7 million the first weekend, a pittance, they imply, compared to such megahits as Twilight, Part 310 and the 2,000th Bond bonanza Skyfall. The L.A. Times asks, “What went wrong?”
Nothing went wrong. The way success is measured is wrong. The movie will very likely not only pay its expenses but make a tidy sum for those who invested in it. Skyfall had a budget of nearly $200 million and Killing Them Softly’s budget was $15 million. During its first weekend it made half its cost back. The film was not intended to be a blockbuster, but a fine film that tells a realistic crime story without superheroes and special effects. It’s a different kind of movie. Saying “it bombed,” is irresponsible journalism.
What fascinated me about all this is that in a way Killing Them Softly is about how our money-oriented culture corrupts everything, including, I would add, what we value. The labeling of this film as a failure because it didn’t compare well to blockbusters shows how far off the compass of the definition of success is. I want to yell at the L.A. Times, what’s wrong with you people?
During the opening credits and reappearing from time to time throughout the film, we hear former President Bush talking about the need to bail out the banks. Paulson is heard too, as is Obama. The gist of what we hear from them is that the banks need to be bailed out, not because it is the morally correct thing to do, or even that they really need it, but they, the rich bankers, need taxpayer money because of an unfortunate perception. And we can pretty much ignore the crimes the bankers committed for the larger good, the greater perception. These brief allusions offer a kind of background music, certainly a theme, which the film mirrors.
The story is about a guy (Ray Liotta) who puts together illegal, high-stakes poker games. Let’s call that Wall Street. The games are real money-makers for a crime syndicate. At one time, many years earlier, the Liotta character robbed his own game (any number of high-profile CEOs may be substituted) though as years past and players changed, his misdeed though now largely known, but considered a funny story, well in the past. However, a clever someone figures out the situation offers the perfect set up. It’s a dangerous idea to rob them. He knows that. These aren’t a bunch of mechanics and taxi drivers blowing off steam on a Friday night. These are genuine tough guys playing the game and even tougher ones running it. It’s big business to the local mafia. But the idea is that the tough guys will figure its Liotta who did it again. The super-tough bad guys would take him out, leaving the real robbers to go free with their loot.
Despite the hilariously inept heist, the concept seems to work. They get the money and they get away.
The syndicate folks call in a professional hit man to take care of business. Enter the mightily cool Brad Pitt. I say that without sarcasm. We don’t know where he came from. We know nothing about him except that he seems to be the sanest, smartest character we’ve met so far. He also advises the mob’s attorney/courier/negotiator, played excellently by Richard Jenkins that it’s not necessary to beat up the Liotta character because they’re just going to have him killed anyway. Why, put the poor guy through the pain? Pitt asks. There’s a committee, the attorney said, that wants it that way. “A committee?” Pitt asks, incredulous. After some thugs beat Liotta mercilessly and endlessly, they conclude he is actually innocent. But he must be killed anyway. It’s a matter of perception. Some might think he did it and got by with it. It’s crucial that the punishment me quick and severe. The poker business is way down. People aren’t showing up and besides, if it appears that the games are such an easy mark, every amateur thug in the area will think they can do it and the players will stay away. That’s not good for the economy, their economy. So, some of guys are killed because they did it. One is killed because the perception of his guilt is bad for business.
The movie, based on the highly regarded noir-novelist George V. Higgins book, Cogan’s Trade, is well put together. The characters are well-drawn and well-acted. Pitt, Liotta and Jenkins, who should be considered for an Academy Award nomination, are joined by James Gandolfini, who, alone, is worth the price of admission as a top-notch hit man, now a dysfunctional alcoholic. Sam Shepard plays an enforcer in this drama that was moved from Higgins’ Boston in the ‘70s to a desolate New Orleans of 2008. Purists might object, but it works. Andrew Dominik directed the film.
In the end, we are left at a bar where Jenkins pays off Pitt, but shorts him on the agreed amount. The television over the bar shows President Obama talking about what it means to be an American. Pitt’s character sarcastically predicts Obama’s standard line, we are not Republicans and Democrats, but we are one community, one country.
It’s probably not a coincidence that in an earlier film based on Higgins novel, bars play an important role. And in this one, Friends of Eddie Coyle (1973), directed by Peter Yates, the film begins with a heist as well. Robert Mitchum is at the top of his form as blue-collar worker in Boston, trying to support a wife and three kids with a low-paying job and questionable supplemental income from highly questionable friends. We all know guys like this. Basically good guys, but willing to cut some ethical corners for a quick return. Desperate times, desperate measures. But Coyle is getting too old for this. And he knows it. That doesn’t mean he can do anything about it. First he gets screwed by the bad guys. Then he gets screwed by the good guys. There’s no escape. Peter Boyle’s portrayal of a bartender who knows how to survive in a corrupt world fits right in with the low-life crowd and Steven Keats, in his first Hollywood film, is, as is said now, “spot on” as the gun runner. Everything about this film screams authentic and is a good match for the more recent Killing Then Softly.
Though the Higgins’ books that formed the basis for these two movies are only a few years apart, there is a huge gap between films. A third film production, Rats on Fire, had been underway, but was stopped by legal issues.
Go see the Pitt film, stop by a local dive, have a beer. Go home, watch Friends of Eddie Coyle with a shot of whiskey and go to bed.

Inspired by the stockings that were “hung by the chimney with care,” it occurred to me that many of my books could provide tiny, inexpensive gifts — Kindle, Nook and iPad stuffers. Great last minute gifts for the mystery lovers in your life.

Also available in trade paperback.
Good to the Last Kiss, Severn House, $2.99. An Inspector Vincent Gratelli mystery — San Francisco Inspector Vincent Gratelli is charged with finding the killer of young women — all murdered in the same way, all left with an intimate mark.

"Tierney's 'Deets' Shanahan series offers characters of depth and sensuality, and well-placed swipes of razor-sharp humor." — Publishers Weekly
Two very different small crime films tackle revenge and betrayal. And viewers would be advised to remember the sage advice of Yankee philosopher Yogi Berra: It’s not over until it’s over.”
In the film Shallow Grave, we are introduced to three Edinburgh flatmates played by Kerry Fox, Christopher Eccleston and Ewan McGregor. After a rigorous if not insane interview process they decide on a fourth mate to help them pay the rent. The man dies, leaving behind a suitcase full of money. The three, not quite self-less, creatures decide to bury the body and, of course, split the treasure. The problem is the money belongs to someone else. And if the three mates are less than honorable members of society, they are angels compared to the folks coming after the money the dead man had taken from them. Fear and greed make strange flat fellows and the trio’s attempt to escape danger and keep the money makes for a twisting and turning plot. The film, released in 1994, was among the first for McGregor. His work here reminded me a bit of an only slightly restrained Malcolm McDowell in Clockwork Orange.
The Dying Gaul (2005) is downright mean. One might not think so watching this little drama begin to unfold. A little love triangle melodrama perhaps? A successful producer, played by Campbell Scott, who in fact produced the film, wants to buy a screenplay from a young and seemingly principled playwright, portrayed by Peter Sarsgaard. The catch is that the producer wants the play, about two gay men in a long-term relationship, to be rewritten so that the main characters are in a heterosexual marriage. All the playwright needs to do is sell out. Would a million dollars do it? Enter the catalyst, the producer’s wife, played by the incredibly talented Patricia Clarkson. All three characters hit it off. Perhaps a bit too much. The producer, we discover, goes both ways. He seduces the emotionally vulnerable playwright, while the producer’s wife, feeling immense compassion for the tragic life of the young man, attempts in a kind, but deceitful way, to help him through his heart-ache. Both good deeds and bad deeds are punished. Compassion turns to revenge and this tiny slice of life drama turns into a slice of hell.
These are not big films. Geographically, you will go nowhere exciting. There is very little action. There aren’t great, overarching glimpses into human nature that haven’t been seen before. However, they are fine, character-driven short stories and certainly a fascinating, eyebrow raising double feature for a quiet rainy evening.
This is a night for wine, a full-bodied red. Be prepared for some dark humor as well seemingly light story that goes very dark.
In the late 1960s, Kurt Vonnegut wrote a letter to a fellow novelist, a friend who was about to teach at the legendary Iowa Writer’s Workshop. Vonnegut, who had done so earlier, had some tips about living and working in Iowa City. He provided some practical suggestions. For example, he told his friend to use the Cedar Rapids airport, not the one in Iowa City. He commented on the workshop’s staff — who to beware of and who might be of help. He also told the novelist turned professor not to worry about credentials. “The University is perfectly used to barbarians in the work shop.” (Vonnegut wasn’t a college graduate either.) But my favorite line in the letter was that if the new guy wanted to enjoy his stay, he should…”run with the painters.” This seemed odd to say at a place known for its famous writers.
Years ago, when I first found out it existed, I joined the Private Eye Writers of America and have attended a couple of annual dinners, one at the famous Slippery Noodle in Indianapolis. It was a combination of awards ceremony and roast. A lot of the writers knew each other. They had been coming to these dinners for years and it was a chance to catch up, talk about old times. I also joined the Mystery Writers of America (MWA) and have taken advantage of a few of their incredible annual conferences (Bouchercons). They have kindly put me on a panel whenever I could attend. I was in the midst of all sorts of writers, some of them legends, but they seemed to gather together in groups, calling each other by their first names, again sharing stories and probably pretty often taking a new, young writer under their collective wings. From all that I could tell, writers are a generous lot and, while seemingly highly competitive — awards, sales, etc. — in many cases very supportive.
I’ve never been hail fellow well met. I’m pretty sure that at these convergences of writers, my stand-offishness was interpreted as aloof or even snobbish by some. I’ve attended a number of meetings of MWA’s northern California chapter. These were lunches usually and often with a speaker who provided valuable, expert information to crime writers — criminal attorneys, homicide cops, medical examiners. These meetings have been worthwhile, but here again there seemed to be established groups who hung out together, veterans in the cause. I don’t fault it. It’s natural. I gravitated to those wanting to write more than those who have already written. I think it is because they seemed a little lost as well.
Friendships, I think, are bonds formed by participation in common struggles. Among writers, especially crime novelists around my age, many came up the same way even if they didn’t know each other. They knew the publishers and editors and other characters in the game.
This is probably happening now, with younger writers, though perhaps in a slightly different way. Pardon the cliché, but publishing is in the process of creating its “new normal”. It has to do with ebooks and social media, tweets, facebook pages and shared blogs and all sorts of stuff yet to be conceived. As an aside, I was never really part of the older group (though I am certainly enough) and I am stumbling and fumbling in this new publishing world as well. Another aside, there was a young man on Charlie Rose who invented a new and popular “app.” The kid is now worth millions. He was fifteen when he developed it. He predicted that future applications will be developed by 12-year-olds. And the conservatives want to raise the retirement age?
But back to the point — painters and writers. I find it difficult to relate to other writers, perhaps for the reasons I mentioned above. I didn’t come up, to the extent that I have, the same way. We don’t share the dimly lit past. And the truth is, as I observe it, that being with other writers prompts a kind of constant evaluation, an ongoing comparison of each other’s work in one way or another. I’m not sure we can help it. It is a kind of constant reminder of the business of writing, of getting published. I prefer to think and talk about other things. For me, writing is not something one does in a group setting.
My guess is that Vonnegut’s advice to “run with the painters” had something to do with that. If you are going to spend all day with upcoming writers for months on end. And your cohorts are also writers, isn’t that a bit much? Painters are creative folks. Most of the ones I have known have great minds, provide stimulating conversation and are often inspiring without posing any sense of competition, at least to writers. If I could still run, I’d probably be running with the painters.

Josh Peace Looks at the Changing Landscape of Marketing Josh Peace Looks at the Changing Landscape of Marketing
There was a time when marketers would seek to make projections based on statistical data gathered. However, with the increasing number of surveys, polls and studies being conducted, it’s oftentimes difficult to collect all that data, let alone make projections on it. Josh Peace, UK entrepreneur and marketing pro, looks at the changing landscape of marketing in the 21st Century and how that impacts the way in which marketing should be conducted.
Based in London, Josh Peace knows that marketing has taken on a whole new landscape. There are such sheer numbers of customers, consumers and prospects to reach that it is mind boggling. Each comes from a different generation, different ethnicities and of course varying experiences that shape the way they do business. “Rather than trying to project how they might buy, I have begun collecting data on their buying behaviour. This is quantifiable data that can be better analysed than trying to label groups and project how and why they ‘might’ buy,” Josh Peace explains.
Also, Josh Peace recognises that all the behavioural statistics that he gathers are constantly in flux. Nothing is static as in days gone by as the explosion of the internet shapes the way consumers think and interact. What this means is that Josh and his team look at how consumers spend their money rather than why. Armed with this information it is easier to categorise them and then market to each group based on those buying behaviours. “This approach is so much more effective because we are not playing the role of fortune teller, rather we are looking at real statistics in order to market to the way in which people are buying.”
As behaviours change, Josh Peace can begin re-shaping his marketing techniques to better speak to current trends. Perhaps the easiest way to think of this is that marketers should no longer try to mould the buying patterns of consumers but instead shape their marketing efforts towards what is working. “It may not tell us why they are buying, but it will tell us what is trending and how they made those purchases,” he explains. Josh is referring to buying patterns such as online vs. brick and mortar sales.
In the end, Josh Peace knows that marketing should follow buying trends rather than the other way around. By shaping a marketing campaign around the way in which consumers are spending their money you have a better chance of reaching them than if you tried to re-shape their motives for buying. Consumers know what they want so this changing marketing landscape is based on the theory that you need to identify what and how they are buying, then you can give it to them. When in Rome, do as the Romans.

My current crusade is to make sure creative people have wills. Read the blog post about it, and see a sample will.
Recently, Marion (my wife) and I had dinner at one of our favorite local restaurants with my primary mentor during my Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation residency, Robert O’Hara, MD, who is now Chief of Informatics at Edward J. Hines Medical Center, though he still has a neurology clinic where he sees patients at the VA Medical Center weekly. Dr. O’Hara’s rounds were so informative, that even when I wasn’t on his rotation I would try to make his teaching rounds. All Dr. O’Hara needed was a good history and physical examination and he could figure out the patients’ problems. Diagnostic tests just confirmed what he already knew. During dinner, we asked him, “What do you think of today’s residents compared to residents from 20 years ago (like when I was one of his residents)?” “No comparison. Todays residents are awful! They don’t know anything. They know where to find the information, but without Google they would be lost! Then when you ask them the same question the next week, they still don’t know it. But they know where to Google it!” We then discussed the topic of diagnostics and how the residents of today just order a test to figure out the patients’ problems. The problem with that logic is typical tests such as MRIs have a tremendously high false positive and negative rate. The results, of course, mean a lot of folks get unnecessary and ineffectual care because their diagnosis, based solely on the MRI, is wrong. Ah, perhaps it is time for medicine to get back to basics.
I was able to practice alongside (or just next door) of Dr. Gustav Hemwall for over three years. By all accounts, he was one of the primary reasons Prolotherapy stayed “alive” in the 1970s through the 1990s. He brought teams of doctors to Honduras during this time, not only to give Prolotherapy to the poor, but also to help doctors learn the technique. His work, along with his wife Helen, continues with the Hackett-Hemwall Foundation, through the guidance of Jeff Patterson, DO and his team at the University of Wisconsin. Dr. Hemwall was 85 when I joined him in 1993 and 88 when he retired in 1996. I am not sure I ever saw him order an MRI. He probably ordered at least one in those years, but why didn’t he order more MRIs? The bottom line is that he didn’t need to. He knew what was wrong just by listening to the person. The physical examination just confirmed that they did indeed have a hip or sacroiliac problem, and then Prolotherapy was given. Even if someone had a pinched nerve in their neck, he knew they had a pinched nerve in their neck and he would tell them. He didn’t need an MRI. His patients didn’t want surgery. That is why they went to him! They wanted to get rid of the pain with Prolotherapy and/or by any other conservative means. He found, as most of us who do Prolotherapy would agree, that MRIs for many patients lead to the wrong diagnosis and inappropriate care, including surgeries.
Havil Maddela, a medical assistant at Caring Medical, is applying to various medical schools and recently he asked me if he should apply to Osteopathic Medical Schools. I gave him an emphatic “yes!” Havil is one of three young volunteers that helped with the Thebes charity work in southern Illinois, who are now, or planning to become, a doctor. The elder of the three, Peter Blakemore, is already an osteopathic doctor and will soon be graduating from his Neuromusculoskeletal Residency and doing Prolotherapy and osteopathic manual therapy on his own patients. Peter teaches anatomy to medical students as part of his current training. I would venture to say that Peter’s knowledge of musculoskeletal anatomy is far greater than Dr. O’Hara’s residents. But how does this play out in real life patient care? Various studies have shown that osteopathic doctors, compared to their MD counterparts, spend more time with their patients and order less medications (like NSAIDs) and traditional tests for low back pain, and their care costs less.1, 2 To be specific, consider this for acute low back pain patients: osteopathic manipulative treatment patients had 18.5% fewer prescriptions written, 74.2% fewer radiographs, 76.9% fewer referrals, and 90% fewer magnetic resonance imaging scans.3 Even with higher Tesla MRI’s or ultrasound diagnostics, nothing beats the accuracy of good ol’ fashioned listening like Dr. Hemwall used to do. He did pretty well. I still know folks who Dr. Hemwall helped with Prolotherapy 20, 30, or 40 years ago.
Like all diagnostic tests, MRI and musculoskeletal ultrasound have their place. For the Prolotherapy practitioner, they are surely helping validate the fact that Prolotherapy indeed does stimulate the repair of tissue. To this end, I report on a couple of young patients with osteochondritis dissecans that used Prolotherapy to get back to their sports. One of the patients had MRI documentation which revealed that his lesion did repair.
The recent growth of Prolotherapy is primarily indebted to the patients that Prolotherapy has helped. This issue features some of these Remarkable Recoveries. Amy Price, missionary, incurred a horrible trauma including a traumatic brain injury. Prolotherapy helped her get back and now she is a PhD helping other traumatically brain-injured people. Jennifer DeLeon became disabled after a car accident where she sustained injuries to her low back, hip, shoulders and neck! Thank God she found Prolotherapy. Now, both women blog their stories to help encourage others to continue to seek care, including Prolotherapy, in order to live healthier, pain free lives. Anna Hamman’s life was being ruined by pelvic floor dysfunction, until she found Prolotherapy. She is now on her second child and back to an active life, in addition to referring several close friends whose lives are also being changed by Prolotherapy.
In addition to the patient’s telling their stories in this issue, there are the four-legged patients whose stories are told for them by Babette Gladstein, VMD. Her continued work through the Humane Society shows that Prolotherapy works time and again to improve, and sometimes save, the lives of those animals she treats. While some patients get better with just Prolotherapy, some require other modalities like physical therapy. Physical Therapist, Richard DonTigny, of The DonTigny Method™, gives some insight into the mobility of the sacroiliac joint. Richard has been an advocate of Prolotherapy over the years.
We have a number of interviews with Prolotherapy doctors from around the globe. These include written interviews with Stephen Cavallino, MD, a Neural Prolotherapist from Italy, David Rabago, MD, one of the most prolific scientific writers and researcher on Prolotherapy, and Simon Petrides, MD who is a prominent sports medicine physician in England.
The last of the Thebes Prolotherapy data is published in this issue. Again, Prolotherapy at this missionary charity clinic was shown to be effective at relieving pain. This time we report on foot pain patient data. Dr. Rodney Van Pelt, one of the doctors who helped at the clinic for over 10 years, demonstrates his technique on treating the ankle and foot.
For the doctor who desires to do Prolotherapy studies in their private practice, Dr. Gary Clark addresses this subject in part two of his four part series. Additionally in It’s a Wide Wide World, Dr. Peter Blakemore reports on the Prolotherapy Weekend in Maine, sponsored by The American Academy of Osteopathy, and licensed practical nurse Joseph Cukla reports on the Age Management Medicine Group 2010 conference in Las Vegas.
If the naturopathic, osteopathic, medical, and veterinary doctors who perform Prolotherapy in all its forms (dextrose, pumice, sodium morrhuate, PRP, bone marrow), use it on appropriate patients based on a good history and examination, it is very likely that Prolotherapy will continue to grow in the United States and throughout the world.

Whether we are simply experiencing a “long overdue correction” of the ongoing secular bull market as the director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, recently opined or whether we’re seeing the beginning stages of a new sustained bear market, it’s still interesting to consider what signs the market might be giving us about the potential for hopelessly invested capital in certain areas of the economy.

So last week Captain America #2 dropped. I honestly want to give a round of applause to Nick Spencer because he didn’t go back on anything that he said in previous interviews after the Captain America: Steve Rogers #1 bomb dropped just under a month ago. I’ll be honest I predicted it. I mean after reading Pleasant Hill, it’s very easy to predict. That doesn’t make it any less impactful, not to mention all the ephemera of his plans that built up to this revelation was admirably meticulous, to say the least.
So what was the reveal? Easy. The second or third page granted a full page to the Red Skull holding the cosmic cube. Let’s backtrack this a little bit. First of all I’d like to point out that the Red Skull has psychic powers. How? Well remember at the end of Avengers vs. X-men when Professor X was killed? Well Skull got his brain. Thing is, Red Skull doesn’t want to use his powers to get people to do his bidding. No, he wants people to follow him because he inspired them to do so, and if he went after Captain America, he wanted to utterly dismantle him, not just control him.
So, let’s move to the cube. It was destroyed in a battle with Captain America into several shards. Those shards became sentient and took the form of a little girl who went to seek out Red Skull as he was its owner, originally. Red Skull saw the opportunity and began putting a plan into motion. I won’t go into complete detail because I would like people to take it upon themselves to check out Pleasant Hill as well as both currently released issues of Captain America: Steve Rogers, but the short story is that the cosmic cube was used to rewrite Steve’s past since childhood so that he had been indoctrinated into Hydra at a young age.
Issue #2 explains all of this and the writing is phenomenal! I’m not lying man, Nick Spencer can tell a good story, and make you appreciate the work he put into it. So yes, it is official now. Steve Rogers is Hydra, which in my mind means that the real Captain America (Sam Wilson) is going to have to stop him. The problem is no one knows that Steve Rogers is Hydra, other than Steve and us readers. That alone is exciting!
For the world that was angry when #1 dropped, I hope you are intrigued by #2. If you’re still angry, I’m sorry that you aren’t as excited about this as I am, because I see some very interesting stories coming up in the near future. Congrats to Nick Spencer on a job well done.

Here we go again or is it this just the way it is in Americans these days involving a gun(s) and shootings causing all sorts of problems with their use in society today. They say that Americans love to own a gun(s), also because it is their constitutional right to bear arms. The question is why do you feel that you need to own a gun(s) other than a constitutional second amendment right to bear arms. We are not in a civil war are we in our own country? We are not fighting a war against a militia are we.
Then why do we have to have a need for a gun(s) in your home? Most people who are gun advocates will state that the second amendment of the constitution gives us that right to have a gun(s) in our homes or possessions. Also we have a right to defend ourselves against those who commit evil acts against their neighbors. Others would say that they have a right to a gun(s) because they like to go hunting as a recreation. These are all of the standard answers as to why people believe they should have the right to own a gun(s). They also believe that if everyone had a gun(s) then this would give the perpetrator a pause about committing a crime against his fellow man because he or she would believe that the person also owned a gun(s).
Our second amendment of the constitution does describe or gives an explanation as to why Americans have a right to bear arms. Here is what the actual second amendment of the constitution states; "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."
Let me try and provide and explanation as to what the second amendment is trying to provide to us as a nation. At the time of this second amendment America did not have an military force of its own to provide protection against those enemies outside of America and those enemies that live within America's own walls.
So when they stated a well regulated militia was when different states took up arms against one another for their own protections. But when America finally became one and incorporated its own military for protection there was no need for a militia.
The second part "being necessary to the security of a free state" this also was when every stated had to provide for their own protection to remain a free state at that time when each state was more so acting independent of a united country. This does not occur anymore because all of the states are under the united union of the United States Of America.
The third part "the right of the people to keep and bear arms" when America as a whole were acting as independent states or some states wanted to act as countries in themselves. The writers of the constitution gave the American people the opportunity to bear or have in their possession weapons or a gun(s), because of the fear that a militia would mount an attack on the people. Now that America is united and together having its own military for protection against outside forces. Also all of the states within the United States of America have their own police force to provide protection against those enemies that are within each state.
The fourth part "shall not be infringed" talked about when the states were independent with no military or police force for protection against the militias the writers wanted to make sure that the people had rights to bear arms and they should not at that time be infringed upon.
Part five put it all together the second amendment; "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." From what you have just read, do we really need a gun(s) in our possession?
Almost every day in America you hear or read in the news of someone being shot and killed with a gun(s). It does not matter how the killings are committed, from regular citizens or the police. Then once in a while we get wind or hear or read of someone committing a mass murder of innocent people. These people being slaughtered for no reason at all, just because of just plain hate. Then we are back to that same old question how did they get access to another gun(s) to commit these heinous crimes in our beloved country of America? The debate continues.
Jasa SEO | Ok, so over the past month or so I've been collecting various search engine optimization questions from all of you. Today, I'm going to answer what was the most frequently asked question over the past month. You guessed it... What is the Google Sandbox Theory and how do I escape it? When you finish reading this lesson, you'll be an expert on the good 'ole Google Sandbox Theory and you'll know how to combat its effects. So, pay close attention. This is some very important stuff.
The Google Sandbox theory is just that, a theory, and is without official confirmations from Google or the benefit of years of observation. The Google Sandbox theory has been floating around since summer 2004, and has only really gained steam after February 4, 2005 , after a major Google index update (something known as the old Google dance).
The distribution and biology of the beaver beetle, Platypsyllus castoris Ritsema, are summarized for North America. In light of the fact that the beetle uses two beaver species as hosts which have seemingly been separated for some five million years on two continents, it is asked if the Nearctic and Palearctic beetle populations are really the same species.
Back in November, I posted proposing that we have an open discussion about social media in IDX. I began the discussion with a long post on December 9, trying to decide what counts as a social media platform. Then I completely dropped the ball. I’m happy to say it’s because our firm has been crazy busy on projects that matter a lot to us (and I hope, to the industry); but I still feel as if I’ve been a bit of a slacker. Now that NAR’s work group has proposed a new set of rule revisions, I thought I’d weigh in.
NAR’s Social Media (or whatever it’s called now) work group met last month to discuss policies to resolve the long-standing debate, and they developed a proposed policy. Matt Cohen has posted a thoughtful review of the new revision recommendations, as well as the text of the proposed revisions themselves. I commend both to you, if you have the time; I’ll try to be thorough here, in case you do not.
They expand the coverage of the existing IDX policy from participants’ “websites” to their “electronic displays.” (See Section 18 and elsewhere.)
They roughly define the notion of participant “control” necessary to make the previous revision fly. Control “means the ability to add, delete, modify, and update information as required by the IDX policy and MLS rules.” (Section 18.2.7)
They exempt some minimal displays of IDX data from some of the disclosure and display requirements. (Sections 18.3.3, 18.3.7, 18.3.8, and 18.3.11)
They introduce the possibility of a participant displaying other brokers’ listings on “other websites,” without really explaining what that means. (Sections 18.3.14, 18.3.15)
They introduce a set of rules for an optional social media IDX (SM/IDX) program, which each MLS may choose to adopt or not. (Section 18.5)
This is what brokers want. They want to be able to deploy their own tablet and mobile apps, displaying IDX data from other brokers according to the IDX rules. They are generally ok with other brokers doing that using their listings. I think this works!
Here is the only significant problem. The proposed policy says control “means the ability to add, delete, modify, and update information as required by the IDX policy and MLS rules.” (Section 18.2.7) This definition is defective on two grounds: First, as Matt Cohen pointed out, it’s not strict enough on the side of actual control. Second, it fails to address apparent control at all. On the question of active control, if Zillow.com (just as an example) provides a ‘dashboard’ on its site at www.Zillow.com that allows the broker the minimal control defined in these terms, then Zillow would count as a site controlled by the participant. (In fact, it would satisfy the definition of “control” for every MLS participant that uses it.) The result, presumably: Broker A could display Broker B’s listings on Zillow as part of IDX. We think that actual control should be more strictly defined. As for apparent control, this is essential if we are to call the display mechanism, whether website or mobile app, a display by one participant of other participants’ listings: a reasonable consumer visiting the app or site should conclude that it belongs to the participant who is displaying the listings pursuant to IDX. In other words, the app or site should be under the apparent control of the displaying broker. This means that a broker does not join the MLS as “ABC Realty” but provide the MLS listings at a site apparently belonging to “AmericasSuperListings.com”, even if America’s Super Listings is the wholly-owned subsidiary of ABC Realty and under its full control. Even under the existing IDX policy, we have found it helpful to clarify what the IDX policy means when it says listing brokers authorize “display of their listings on other participants’ Internet websites.” The following language, which NAR has approved for our clients, has proven manageable and enforceable (key terms emphasized):
Any Website that displays any portion of the IDX Database must be under the actual and apparent control of a single IDX Participant and must be advertised as that IDX Participant’s Website. Actual control means that the IDX Participant has either built the Website for its own use with internal resources or obtained technology for the Website under an agreement with a third party that provides the IDX Participant final control over the operations of the Website. Apparent control means that a reasonable consumer viewing the Website would conclude that it is under the control of the IDX Participant. The following are currently deemed to be evidence of apparent control: that the IDX Participant’s branding is more prominent than that of any other entity and that the domain name and branding on the Website distinguish the IDX Participant from non-participating firms, e.g., from the participant’s franchise and from other franchisees of the same franchise, if applicable.
This prevents both the Zillow and ABC Realty examples I gave above. I admit this is not an ideal definition of control, but unlike much of the proposed revision, it has been tested by years of use among our clients. It works well enough. What this does mean, though, is that a broker buying a mobile app from a third-party provider must be able to shut down the app (at least with regard to the broker’s use of it) and must have the broker’s branding on it, so the consumer sees it as the broker’s app (perhaps ‘powered by’ the third party). NAR should adopt language something like what we’ve proposed, or at least confirm that it will allow MLSs to adopt it (though with references changed from “Website” changed (edit 5/1/2012) to “IDX Display” or the like).
Clearly, if brokers are going to make good use of mobile apps, there will be instances where minimal information about a listing needs to be displayed as a ‘teaser’ to get the consumer to select the listing for further review. The changes proposed in Sections 18.3.3, 18.3.7, 18.3.8, and 18.3.11 allow those minimal displays to stop short of complying with all IDX display requirements, provided one can get from the minimal display to a fully-compliant display. I don’t see any problems with that.
Sections 18.3.14 and 18.3.15 address requirements for security protection and firewalls. Section 18.3.14 reads: “Participants are required to employ appropriate security protection such as firewalls on their websites and displays, and on displays controlled by participants on others’ websites.” Matt expressed concern about this, and I echo it. No agent or broker under this policy should ever display IDX data on “others’ websites.” See my discussion of control above. I suggest that “and on displays by participants on others’ websites” be deleted.
I can see a number of potential problems with Section 18.5, which gives MLSs the option of permitting one broker to display another broker’s listings on a site not controlled by the displaying broker. I’d like to discuss those issues further, but that can wait for another day. For now, I urge every MLS not to adopt the provisions of Section 18.5 until you’ve discussed the ramifications very carefully.
Overall, I’m very pleased by this version of what NAR has proposed. I hope it gets adopted with the changes I’ve suggested. I recommend that MLSs wait on the social media option in 18.5, though, until its implications can be better understood. I would really love to hear from MLSs and the industry’s luminaries how they feel about these proposals. Please comment freely.
Brian, it seems like we're entirely on the same page, though I suggested that maybe the Social Media part could possibly be improved (with a lot of work) to where it was adoptable.
One thing I noticed is that sec. 18 removes the definition of Internet Website, but the sec. 18.1 still has the seller opt-out as all Internet display, which seems like a sloppy loophole for mobile. Am I over thinking that? Sec. 18.2.3 also mentions Internet specifically.
I am not a fan of 18.3.3 (and the others)including thumbnails, because traditionally, IDX search results list photos,
The concept of displaying another broker's listings on sites other than those owned, operated or controlled by a broker introduces something new that will be unacceptable to many brokers. As a broker, I'm fine with the original IDX concept, however I wouldn't go along with another broker posting my listings in a manner that most consumers will see as listed by the other broker. I don&

Stan Lee, who dreamed up Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk and a cavalcade of other Marvel Comics superheroes that became mythic figures in pop culture with soaring success at the movie box office, died at the age of 95, his daughter said on Monday.As a writer and editor, Lee was key to the ascension of Marvel into a comic book titan in the 1960s when, in collaboration with artists such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he created superheroes who would enthrall generations of young readers.“He felt an obligation to his fans to keep creating,” his daughter J.C. Lee said in a statement to Reuters. “He loved his life and he loved what he did for a living. His family loved him and his fans loved him. He was irreplaceable.”She did not mention Lee’s cause of death but the TMZ celebrity news website said an ambulance was called to Lee’s Hollywood Hills home early Monday and that he died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

I'm working on my first annual review as a librarian, and it's turning out to be quite a challenge. In my old job, I had to write annual reviews as well, but these were intended solely for my supervisor and library administration. My librarian review has to go through a peer review process that determines a final performance rating that establishes how much of a raise I'll get for the next fiscal year. Therefore I need to write the review such that it clearly portrays to librarians who don't deal daily with digital library issues the importance of the work I do, and that I'm good at it. I've never been all that good at explaining what I do to other people - I guess I just figure since I realize it's important, everyone else should too. But of course I know that's not true. I've decided my best approach is to treat this like a learning experience. OK, enough ranting - back to work on the review!
right a guy goes up to a geinie and hi says you can get 3 wishes but your wife gets two the man says can i have a car so he gets a car and the wife gets 2 then he says can i have a house so the wife gets 2 and he says can i get beaten half to death so the wife gets beaten to death ahhahahahaha lol funny eh?
Later on he comes out and BOOM! there is the snail again,.....so he gets close to the snail and looks him in the eye and tells him "WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!!!"

Chyawanprash is the largest selling Ayurvedic product and also one of the healthiest one. It was invented thousands of years ago by great vaidyas. Acharya Charak documented it in his epic book 'Charak Samhita' that itself tells the importance of this Ayurvedic product. It is a kind of jam which is sticky and dark brown in color. It can be taken by people, from literally any age group.
Although, it is easily available in grocery stores but homemade Ayurvedic chyawanprash has its own advantages. We will tell you how to make delicious chyawanprash at home. Keep reading -
First of all boil amla with the sansadhan ingredients on a medium flame for 1 hour so that amla can absorb the extracts from herbs. Turn off the heat and leave the mixture in the same utensil for the next 6 hours.
Sieve the remnant herbs from the utensil and keep the water safe in it. This holds many nutrients which will be needed ahead. Wash all the amlas with water and place in another utensil. Now take out the amla pulp by extracting the seeds out of it.
Take an iron or steel pan, preheat it and put sesame oil and butter into it. Add amla pulp and the water you had saved into it and stir it constantly until it gets thick. Butter will start to get separated from amla.
Once the mixture starts boiling, add sugar to it and stir until it gets a thick consistency. When the mixture is really thick, turn off the heat and let it cool for another 5-6 hours.
Now grind all the prekshap ingredients including cinnamon (by breaking it into small pieces) and add to the cooled mixture.
All the ingredients which we used in making chyawanprash are easily available in local market. So what are you waiting for? Go and make this healthy and delicious jam. Do share this recipe with your friends and relatives.
Start your day with mixed sprouts sandwich which has high nutritional value. They are not only health rejuvenator but also mood freshers. Sprouts are wonder foods which are rich in fibre, protein, minerals, vitamins, and enzymes. Natural sprouts are good for a healthy body and mind development. It ensures blood purification and strengthens the immune system. In naturopathy, due to its preserving and promoting health aspects, sprouts are termed as medicine.
Ayurveda considers sprouted grains, beans and seeds as the healthiest kind of food as it is sattvic food.
Vatas should have black lentils, mung beans or any nuts and seeds; consume with digestive spices like black pepper, ginger, and cumin.
Kaphas should have any legumes like chickpeas, beans like aduki, black, white, navy, pinto, etc except mung beans, lentils, soybeans and kidney beans); consume with digestive spices like ginger, black pepper and cumin. Sprouts are highly beneficial for Kapha.
Boil 1 ½ cup of water and then soak sprouts in this water for about 15-20 min. Add salt to it and just grind it for few seconds to prepare very coarse paste of it.
In a wok or kadhai, heat little oil over a moderate flame and stir-fry the paste for a while and add wheat flour to it. Stir it for 2-3 minutes and let it cool down.
Prepare chutney by grinding coriander leaves, mint leaves, green chillies and salt. Add lemon juice to it for a nice taste.
Spread the chutney on the bread slices and place sprouts paste evenly on green chutney on 4 of the slices. Cover each slice with the remaining slices.
Heat the tawa and toast sandwiches over medium flame. Add little ghee on the edges so sandwiches will become crispier.
Effective January, 1, 2016: All hospice providers will be impacted by Hospice Payment Reform. Please see Information Release MA15-08, "Hospice Payment Reform Provider Education" and the revised "Hospice Notification Form" under the Resources section of this page.
Hospice agencies are required to notify Medicaid for all Medicaid, Medicare or commercial insurance participants electing Hospice services. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) require the hospice agency to simultaneously notify both programs regarding election, recertification, discharge, revocation, or transfer between hospices, for participant’s who are dually eligible. Medicaid recertification periods are every eight months, and the provider agency is responsible to track, and meet, all due dates. (Note: Medicare’s certification periods are different.)
All status changes related to hospice care should be submitted within fifteen business days to the Medical Care Unit. Status changes must be submitted on the Hospice Notification Form with documentation for eight month Election or Recertification periods. Supporting documentation is not needed for notification of death, transfer, discharge (hospice chooses to end care if no longer meets eligibility criteria), or revocation (participant chooses to end care). The primary hospice diagnosis ICD code submitted to Medical Care Unit must match the terminal illness diagnosis code used to bill Medicaid.

Dearest Libre tribe. I recently did an interview with Andrea Cairella on happiness. You can listen to the full interview here. Check out some of the highlights, below.
“Yes. There is so much more. And it’s really about realizing that happiness comes from within, and it’s about creating a life from that place, rather than thinking it comes from some place external to us.”
LL: The first one is both a strategy and the foundation of all of the ones that come afterwards. It’s the realization that in order to find what we’re seeking we have to look inward. We have this capacity to have this deeply impacted and deeply impactful sense of a very grounded happiness and peace in our lives. That comes from within us, rather than something that we might find.
That is the biggest and most important mind-set shift that I needed to arrive at in my life and that I help other people arrive at in their lives–to realize we have the power to change our lives, we have the power to change our experiences from within. That’s the foundation of it all.
click to tweet: @lindsey_lewis: we have the power to change our lives, we have the power to change our experiences from within.
This evolves into strategies. And there are so many of them but some of the ones I love the most are:
To practice this realization that we’ll have so many thoughts in a day or in a moment and that thoughts are not necessarily truths, but if we choose to believe them as such it will impact how we see a moment, a person, our life, the entire world.
From there, we bring in The Work by Byron Katie, which is a very powerful tool I love to use to help people question thoughts or fears or limiting beliefs that are really undermining their potential for happiness and then turn them around so that that part of them that was causing them so much stress or unhappiness is actually affirming their peace, their strength, their well-being and their potential to emerge into a life filled with all of that.
LL: Here’s one I did not understand the power of for a long time: integrating gratitude practices. I was dismissive of this for a while, but what I can tell you is that when I heard one of the reasons why this works so well I changed my mind. The part of our brain in charge of worry and feeling negativity can’t be dominant if the part of our brain in charge of thinking gratitude-related types of thoughts and feeling gratitude-related emotions is turned on. We can’t really have one turned on if the other is turned on.

The federal government is taking the first small steps toward rolling back some of the harm that Obama has done as it regards perpetuating the War on the West. While there is much more to do, the repeal of this BLM rule is a blow to the fake ‘sportsman’ groups run by radical environmentalists who want to shut down all productive uses of federal lands.
Congressman Sam Johnson (R-TX) and Ralph Abraham (R-LA) — and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) in the Senate — have introduced resolutions to overturn Barack Obama’s Social Security Gun Ban.

President Barack Obama’s designation of lands and waters as national monuments has amounted to more than 553 million acres over his eight years as president, which would cover the state of Texas three times, according to Media Research Center’s MRC TV.
“Utah’s state legislature, however, opposed the unilateral land grab across party lines, with many speculating that Obama’s move is the latest in an attempt to limit efforts from incoming President Donald Trump to expand domestic energy production.”
While Obama created a marine preserve off the coast of Hawaii in the summer of 2016, reports show that it deprived the local fishing industry of $10 million, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Despit longstanding demands from the US government that Vietnam improve its human rights record before the US would lift its arms embargo, Obama announced at a news conference in Hanoi on Monday that the embargo would be lifted immediately.
Obama said that human rights “is an area where we still have differences” with Vietnam, but offered no assurances that anything would change. The New York Times reports that human rights advocates are dismayed.
In a move seen by many critics of President Barack Obama as a continuation of his administration’s “war on coal,” Interior Secretary Sally Jewell ordered a three-year moratorium on new coal leases on federal land.
In her January 17 announcement of the rule, Jewell cited concerns over coal’s supposed contribution to climate change as the reason for the moratorium, saying the Interior Department will conduct a new analysis of how the extraction and burning of coal could make global climate change more likely.

This winter, Europeans complained heavily about the absence of snow, making alpine skiing almost impossible in parts of the Alps. Strange new weather patterns, with mild temperatures during the winter are becoming a commonality. However, first world problems like these are a piece of cake, compared to climate developments in Africa. This January, humanitarian agencies alarmed the public about an ongoing drought in East Africa, resulting in a significant deterioration of food security with a severe risk of a widespread famine. Millions of people are in need of immediate food assistance to cope with the unfavorable climate. Even though news coverage remains slim, various new data-heavy approaches aim to tackle the challenge of drought-related famine in developing countries. One of those projects is the ‘Satellite Technologies for Improved Drought Risk Assessment’ (SATIDA).
SATIDA is a research project, supported by Médecins sans Frontières and the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), which focuses on the utilization of satellite data (such as rainfall, land surface temperature, vegetation status, surface and profile soil moisture) for a better prediction of the region-specific drought and famine risk. The unique angle of this project is its inclusion of socio-economic data, gathered directly via smartphone app in the relevant communities. We had the opportunity to catch up with Markus Enenkel, project lead of SATIDA and current postdoc fellow at Columbia University in New York to talk about the project, the key learning and the role of data science in international development efforts.
idalab: Mr Enenkel, what got you guys started to look into the benefits of satellite data for a better coordination of humanitarian aid?
At the core of the project initiation was the high level of ambiguity between the vast amount of data, which is accessible nowadays and its current usage in daily operations of humanitarian aid organizations. Generally, there is so much satellite data about the climate, but little of it is used outside of scientific research. So we were really eager to bring the knowledge of our domain into direct application and help humanitarian aid organizations to leverage this data in their daily operations. For us, this had direct implications on the research design as we set out to interact directly with the user – in this case the humanitarian aid organization -, and have constant feedback loops to ensure that data will essentially be turned into information.
idalab: When put into the perspective of a data value chain, you are essentially claiming that only real-world applications are turning existing data into value?
Yes, precisely. The activities of data science encompass generally two different domains. First, we have the handling of data, its integration and calibration. The second part, however, the direct translation of data into tools and applications is much more interesting for the user. So at SATIDA we were challenged to not only depend on observational data, climate forecasts and the likes, but to try to establish a link between satellite data, climate shocks and local conditions. Because only if we establish such a link, do we ensure that our findings have a real-world impact.
idalab: Could you elaborate a little bit more on how you approached the integration of climate and socio-economic data?
The climate component of the model revolved around the detection of anomalies in satellite data on dimensions such as precipitation, temperature, soil moisture and vegetation health. But this data is only interesting if put into a realistic context. The socio-economic part of the model concerns the effects of climate shocks on local conditions. The essential problem was that there is no harmonized, long-term dataset, which could potentially display this information. Therefore we teamed up with Médecins sans Frontières to develop a mobile application in order to gather this data in the Central African Republic. Our goal was to essentially detect patterns for the development of scenarios. For example, if at the beginning of the growing season, there is a high soil moisture anomaly, and I have seen such a situation already two years ago and I know how it developed until June. Then I could potentially abstract that towards a prediction on how the situation this year is going to evolve.
idalab: The detection of anomalies was solely focused on satellite data and then ‘validated’ by socio-economic feedback?
Our project was focused on the pre-operational stage. In order to really use both data sources for decision-making, one would need longer time series of socio-economic data, which we didn’t have. So, our project essentially tried to establish the necessary pre-conditions, so that more effective forecasts and predictions are possible in the future. If aid organizations in sensitive African areas would periodically use smartphones to collect information on, for example, malnutrition and price developments then we could slowly but surely build up the necessary datasets we need to allow for a better integration of satellite and socio-economic data.
idalab: Is the absence of coherent data sets one of the major challenges to unlock the potential of data science in international development?
Yes, if you look at the availability of such data sets in Europe and the US, you can imagine that it will not necessarily be better in Africa. Because even in Europe and the US records regarding agricultural losses are oftentimes neither updated nor easy to access. You can imagine that it will certainly not be better in a country, where there is political instability and poverty. There are some agricultural statistics by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), but those are rarely specific enough. In addition, these statistics are not really touching upon information, which we care about: What are the current vulnerabilities? How do people cope with the situation and what mechanisms do they apply to strengthen their resilience? Do they lend money? Do they sell their cattle? Those are things we need to understand, patterns we need to recognize. But the data for those endeavours still has to be collected. And that, I believe is also part of data science in international development cooperation. While we have satellite data of great abundance, this sole existence might be of little value on the ground. It is only beneficial, when accompanied with direct feedback from the user, in order to foster an understanding for the data and to discuss that insights are rarely black and white, but oftentimes gray. We believe that such an endeavor requires a more fine-grained local approach, engaging the relevant stakeholders, in order to enable them to make decisions based on data that are tailored to their needs.
When we gathered data in the Central African Republic in 2015, we found that one third of the people in our assessment had received a food distribution in the previous year. So, we actually assumed that there was a food shortage, which was a direct effect of a drought. But when we looked at the climate data, we found that there was no anomaly whatsoever. In the end, it turned out that the reason for the food shortage was an armed conflict between two rebel groups, which prevented the farmers from cultivating their fields, which led to a decrease in yield. And these are precisely the relationships and impacts, we have to understand.
idalab: You set out to improve the drought risk assessment with a new seasonal forecast. How satisfied were you with the results?
In the monitoring part of the project, we performed quite well. We composed a drought-index for Ethiopia and the Central African Republic, which captured all relevant drought events. Unfortunately, though, the seasonal forecasting did not work out as expected. Essentially it boils down to the question what kind of uncertainty can a seasonal forecast have to still create added value for the user, because it takes some time and effort to integrate such a tool into the decision-making process. And if a seasonal forecast reveals that there is a 80% chance of a very low precipitation in the next few months, this might lead some people to say ‘wow, 80%, we should equip ourselves’. But others might say ‘well, there is a 1-in-5 chance that we get away with doing nothing’. So, how should resources be allocated based on such a forecast? Generally I would claim that in areas of central Africa, where there is a general vulnerability to climate shocks, additional resources are never a bad investment, but in international development, which is very donor-driven, every decision needs to be justified on a solid basis.
We tried to use our combined drought-index of the satellite data regarding precipitation, surface temperature, soil moisture and vegetation health to calibrate seasonal forecasts. So, seasonal forecasts are initially to a large part based on the monitoring index, then there is an overlapping part of monitoring index and seasonal forecast and in the end the forecast is solely seasonal. Assessing our approach from a statistical perspective, we found that the forecasting precision rapidly decreases after 20 to 30 days. Initially, we wanted to have a forecast, which works well for several months. But with our current model, I would not feel confident to make a prediction which goes beyond one month.
idalab: Despite the mentioned forecasting challenges, you are now looking into how to operationalize the research?
We are currently reviewing our findings with Médecins sans Frontières. It should not be our task to continuously go into the field and collect data. Rather, we aim for snowball effects, training local multipliers with the relevant smartphone app and help them engage others. When we did that in the Central African Republic, it worked surprisingly well. Within a few days, the selected individuals were able to gather data without supervision.
idalab: How do you generally see the receptiveness of humanitarian aid organizations towards data-driven approaches?
There might be lot of scepticism, but the key is definitely communication. If you just communicate that you will try to use satellite data in a new and innovative way, juggling with scientific acronyms, you will never receive good feedback. It is essential to involve the organizations into a dialogue, understand their needs and wants. At the same time, it is crucial to honestly communicate existing limitations of your own approach. If people see real value for their daily operations, they are definitely willing to invest time and effort.
As many aid organizations are supported by many individual donors, there is a great focus on results. Unfortunately, research always inherits the possibility of failure – one might conclude that whatever was attempted did not work out. Such information is equally valuable, but might be tough to justify in front of donors. Thus, there is a tendency to stick with the usual approach. In this setting, the role of research-sponsoring organizations is crucial, because otherwise innovation would never spread into these domains.
idalab: Interestingly, though, all humanitarian aid organizations alike could heavily benefit from data. Are there initiatives for a joint effort?
Generally, I think it would be a very efficient approach to identify a pool of organizations with similar demands and then try to develop tools, which cater their needs. Is it possible to develop such local data pools across organizations? I believe it is, even though every organization is highly specific. A flexible approach could accommodate this particular situation. With our app, for example, organizations like the Red Cross, Médecins sans Frontières or the World Food Program could all be involved in gathering core data regarding malnutrition, local prices and coping mechanisms. But all organizations would also have the opportunity to modify and extend the application to collect more specific information, which benefits their organization. While the core data set would remain accessible for everyone, organization could retain rights over the additionally collected data. This would provide an adequate infrastructure for building-up reliable time series of socio-economic data in order to enable more sophisticated analysis.

Let Graham Russell, keen birder and bird photographer, take you on a guided birding walk in the indigenous forest. See and hear many of the 150 bird species that are found in Hogsback.
Both beginner and experienced birders will benefit from Graham's knowledge of local birds and conditions.
The Cape parrot is endemic, endangered and highly localised, being found in small patches of Afromontane forest in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal.
It feeds exclusively on fruit, mainly foraging in the early morning and late afternoon. It nests in pre-existing tree holes, especially in Podocarpus (Yellowwood).
The felling of yellowwood trees is the main reason for its Endangered status, as it results in difficulty in location of nesting sites, leading to a poor reproductive rate.
The female lays 2-5 eggs, which are incubated by by the female only, for 28-30 days. The chicks stay in the nest for 55-79 days, after which they may remain with their parents for about one year.

The Bayerische Volkssternwarte is located near Ostbahnhof in the middle of Munich. Unfortunately being in the city is not the best location for watching the night sky with the world of stars, because of the light pollution. But you will be compensated for this by the convenience to reach it.
This is definitely much easier than going all the way to Palo Alto or any other observatory somewhere in the middle of the dessert.
The Munich observatory is run by volunteers and has a very friendly and familiar touch. First you are guided through the exhibition with competent explanations of the samples shown. There are some really cool samples of lunar rocks and pieces of comets and asteroids. Very impressive! You are even allowed to touch the exhibits.
Afterwards the guided tour continues to the "heart" of the observatory: the three big astronomical telescopes on the roof of the building.
They're pre-positioned to see the brightest stars of the month, like Venus in January or Saturn in April. Off course you can see the stars only, when the night sky is clear. I highly recommend to visit, when there aren't any clouds.
But even with bad weather, the Munich observatory is still worth a visit. Apart from the small museum, another highlight is the planetarium, which features a breathtaking show of an artificial night sky with millions of stars in a 4.5 m sky dome.
Even when the weather is too bad to see any real stars, you still can admire the splendid night sky (and in even better quality).
The guided tour through the exhibition as well as the stars to watch change every month, so you can come here more often than once.
Your first thought about your trip probably isn't Munich shopping, but you'll soon find out that we have plenty of great shops, boutiques, department stores, galleries, ...
There's virtually nothing you can't buy in Munich, ranging from low priced 99 cents stores up to the most expensive designer labels like Chanel, Armani, or Hermes in the exclusive Maximilianstrasse. You can buy hip clothing, gorgeous shoes, interesting books, funny gifts, tacky souvenirs, expensive jewelry, or even a terrific BMW car.
Being the capital of Bavaria and the biggest city around here, Munich is a magnet to many people from small villages and towns to do the shopping here they can't do at home.
The busiest shopping area is definitely the "Fussgängerzone" between Karlsplatz (Stachus) and Marienplatz in the center of Munich.
If you prefer short ways, Munich has a few BIG shopping centers with all kinds of stores under one roof. Which is especially nice, when it rains!
The OEZ is located next to the Olympiapark, where the 1972 Olympic summer games were held. You reach it via the underground lines U1 or U3.
This newest of the Munich shopping centers was inaugurated a few years ago, but somehow we never got around to visiting it. With that many fantastic shops in Munich, it's difficult to visit them all ;-)
Tobi and I were very pleased by the modern architecture, the calm atmosphere and, off course, the variety of stores.
Ok, ok, I was pleased by the boutiques, he enjoyed a big ice cream in one of the nice cafés meanwhile :-)
If your man is like mine, bribe him to visit the Olympia Shopping Center with a fantastic ice cream, or even better, with the electronics and computer store in the basement. This should give you more than enough time to explore the other shops.
The PEP is located in Perlach, a district in the southeast of Munich. You can get there easily with the underground U5.
It's not the most obvious shopping place for a tourist, because it's quite far away from the center. Nevertheless, I like going there (I used to live around the corner) and the PEP management always comes up with actions like fashion shows or Christmas markets inside the shopping center, which make a visit worthwhile.
Former Big League Manager Jim Riggleman discusses the proper way to get down the first base line after hitting the ball in this video tip. It is important to develop good habits when base running so they become second nature to you, always take a peak as you are coming down the line to see whether the ball has been fielded or it has gotten through to the outfield.
Hi, this is Jim Riggleman of Inside Baseball dot com, and I'm going to give you a couple things after you've made contact at home plate coming out of the box. If we hit a ground ball, we hit a ground ball and the infielder's made a play on the ball, we will have taken a glance to see if he has made a play on the ball. If we know he's made a play on the ball, we're going to be coming straight down the line as hard as we can go, hit the base full speed. We can turn it down once we get past the base. Run hard all the way through the base. Once we hit the base, as we come through, whether he's caught the ball or not, get in the habit of looking over your right shoulder. You look over your right shoulder to see if the ball's gotten away, and you will then make a decision as to whether you're going to go to second or not. If you look over your left shoulder, that can be interpreted by the umpire as a move to second base. They pick up the ball, tag you out. So get in the habit of looking over your right shoulder, finding the ball. Another move. If we've hit a ball into the outfield-- we've made contact, we got a ball into the gap, ball gets through the infield or whatever. It's into the outfield. There's no reason to continue to run straight. As soon as you know the infielder hasn't made a play, create yourself an angle that you're going to be able to round first and go to second. So this move right here, I'm going to come through here, hit the inside of the base, hopefully with the left foot-- not mandatory-- hopefully with the left foot. But that angle can be created as soon as you know the ball's in the outfield, whether it's a hard ground ball or a fly ball that goes to the outfield, we create that angle and we're coming in this direction, which now I'm going to have a quicker move to second base as opposed to running full speed and then trying to veer out and go. Thank you. That's Jim Riggleman, Inside Baseball dot com.
Jim Riggleman was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1974 out of Frostburg State University. Riggleman was an infielder and outfielder for the Los Angeles Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals organizations from 1974-1981. After his playing career ended, Jim managed in the Cardinals and San Diego Padres minor league systems until 1992 when he became the San Diego Padres manager. Riggleman managed the Padres, Chicago Cubs, Seattle Mariners and the Washington Nationals from 1992-2011, and was a major league coach with the Dodgers, Mariners and Nationals between his major league coaching stints. In 2014, Riggleman was the manager of the Louisville Bats, the Class AAA affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds organization.
Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines have celebrated the delivery of the carrier's first Boeing 787-9. Ethiopian is leasing the Dreamliner through an agreement with AerCap.
Ethiopian's newest 787 touched down in Addis Ababa following a non-stop 8,354 mile (13,444 km) delivery flight from Boeing's Everett, Wash., facility. Ethiopian becomes the first carrier in Africa to operate the 787-9 and extends a tradition of setting aviation milestones. Ethiopian became Africa's first carrier to fly the 787-8 in 2012, and similarly introduced the 777-200LR (Longer Range), 777-300ER (Extended Range) and 777 Freighter.
“We are proud to celebrate yet another first with the introduction of the cutting-edge 787-9 into our young and fast growing fleet,” said Mr. Tewolde GebreMariam, Group CEO of Ethiopian Airlines. “Today, the 787 is the core of our fleet with 20 aircraft in service. Our investment in the latest technology airplanes is part of our Vision 2025 strategy and our commitment to our esteemed customers to offer complete on-board comfort. We will continue to invest in the most advanced aircraft to give our customers the best possible travel experience.”
The 787 Dreamliner is the most innovative and efficient airplane family flying today. Since 2011, more than 600 Dreamliners have entered commercial services, flying almost 200 million people on more than 560 unique routes around the world, saving an estimated 19 billion pounds of fuel.
“AerCap is very proud to deliver to Ethiopian Airlines their first 787-9 aircraft, as the airline continues to lead the way in African aviation,” said AerCap President and Chief Commercial Officer Philip Scruggs. “The 787-9 will complement Ethiopian's existing fleet of 787-8 aircraft, bringing further operational efficiencies and scope to enhance their existing network. We thank our friends and partners at Ethiopian Airlines for their continued confidence in AerCap and wish them every success as they continue to optimize their fleet.”
“We are pleased to see the 787-9 enter into Ethiopian's growing Boeing fleet,” said Marty Bentrott, senior vice president sales for Middle East, Turkey, Africa, Russia & Central Asia Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “The 787-9 will further enhance the Ethiopian network with its incredible range and capacity.”
Ethiopian Airlines conducted its 32nd Humanitarian Delivery Flight as part of the 787-9 delivery. In conjunction with the non-profit Seattle Alliance Outreach, Ethiopian transported goods donated by medical organizations in the U.S. to Black Lion Hospital and St. Paul Hospital in Ethiopia.
“We are very happy to continue our longstanding partnership with Boeing to deliver medical equipment and supplies to public hospitals in Ethiopia, which benefit the society at-large,” said GebreMariam. “This is our 32nd humanitarian flight over the course of the last few years. No airline has provided such sustained support to the delivery of humanitarian supplies to the African continent. It is a testament to our commitment to serve the community as a responsible corporate organization.”
Ethiopian Airlines operates a Boeing fleet of 737, 767, 777, and 787 airplanes in passenger service and six 777 and two 757-200 airplanes in cargo operations.
Diehard Chinese AFL fans eagerly awaiting the blockbuster video game dedicated to their favourite code are in for a treat, with the developers today confirming that one of the sport’s most recognizable faces will grace the cover of the local edition.
“We wanted to give the Chinese fans a familiar face, somebody they could identify with and who better to fill that role than the man they see whining on morning tv and disrespecting their national colors?” said head developer Chris Jennings.
The studio also confirmed rumours that Koch only just beat out Chinese president Xi Jinping for the coveted role, who himself is a massive AFL fan and long-suffering member of the Gold Coast.
Because Silenor (doxepin tablets) passes through breast milk, the manufacturer of this drug recommends that women use Silenor with caution while nursing a child. Research studies have shown that the active ingredient could cause problems such as excessive drowsiness and breathing difficulties in a breastfed infant. Before using Silenor, breastfeeding women should ask their healthcare providers about the potential risks.
Silenor® (doxepin tablets) passes through breast milk in humans. The manufacturer of Silenor recommends that women use this medication with caution while breastfeeding. Therefore, if you are breastfeeding, talk with your healthcare provider before taking Silenor.
Studies have shown that doxepin (the active ingredient in Silenor) passes through breast milk. There has been one report of apnea (dangerously slow or irregular breathing) and drowsiness in an infant who was exposed to doxepin through breast milk. However, the infant's mother was taking a much higher doxepin dosage (to treat depression) than is used in Silenor.
In another case, an infant exposed to doxepin through breast milk developed drowsiness, low muscle tone, poor sucking and swallowing, and vomiting.
In general, medications that contain doxepin (including Silenor) are thought to be inappropriate for use while breastfeeding, especially if you are nursing a newborn. In some cases, doxepin might be appropriate, if extra caution is taken (to watch for side effects) and if the infant is older.
If your healthcare provider decides that it is okay for you to take Silenor while nursing, make sure to watch for any changes or problems in your infant. In particular, you might watch for excessive drowsiness or breathing difficulties.

Pride and a ticket to next year’s AFC Champions League are on the line for two K-League clubs this weekend.
The Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma and Suwon Bluewings will play in the FA Cup finals at 2 p.m. tomorrow at the Seongnam Sports Complex in Seongnam, Gyeonggi, providing fans with what is expected to be an exciting game. The football teams were evenly matched when they faced off twice in the regular season, splitting the games and scoring three goals apiece.
Seongnam still has a shot at winning both the FA Cup and the K-League titles. Having placed fourth overall in league standings this season, the team advanced to the first round of the K-League playoffs with a record of 13 wins, six ties and nine losses. After facing Suwon in the FA Cup tomorrow, Seongnam is set to play Incheon United in the first round of the K-League playoffs the very next day.
The biggest goal for both Seongnam and Suwon tomorrow is to clinch a spot in next year’s Champions League tourney. If Seongnam does not win the FA Cup, things get a little complicated, as the team will then have to win the Sunday K-League playoff match against Incheon United and advance to the second round to clinch a Champions League berth.
Suwon, however, won’t have the luxury of getting a second chance. The Bluewings finished 10th in the league, so the FA Cup game is their only shot at a berth in next year’s Champions League tourney. The Cha Bum-kun-managed squad struggled this season after a slow start, limping to an unimpressive record of eight wins, eight ties and 12 losses. Still, the team has a shot at salvaging an otherwise disappointing season by winning the FA Cup.
The sideline matchup is another point of intrigue as Seongnam’s rookie manager Shin Tae-yong will try to outwit veteran Cha.
On the field, Seongnam will count on Mauricio Molina, Cho Dong-kun and Kim Jung-woo to lead its attack, while Suwon will look to Edu and Kim Do-heon. Molina led Seongnam in scoring during the K-League season with eight goals and three assists while forward Cho Dong-kun had six goals and four assists. Suwon will count on forward Edu, who has seven goals and four assists, and Kim, who has four goals and four assists in his first season back after playing for West Bromwich Albion of the English Premier League.
The growth pace of household lending by local banks slowed down in July amid a marginal drop in both mortgage and non-mortgage loans, central bank data showed Thursday.
Outstanding household loans from banks came to 796.6 trillion won ($711.4 billion) as of the end of last month, up 4.8 trillion won from June, according to the data from the Bank of Korea (BOK).
The on-month gain slowed down from 5 trillion won tallied in June and marked the smallest on-month growth since March, when bank lending rose 4.3 trillion won.
Home-backed mortgages climbed by 3.1 trillion won on-month to 587.7 trillion won last month, slightly narrowing from a 3.2 trillion-won gain in June.
Also, non-mortgage loans, including lending through overdraft lines of credit, gained 1.7 trillion won on-month to 208 trillion won in July, slowing from a 1.8 trillion-won expansion tallied in the previous month.
The central bank said the growth pace of household lending seems to have returned to the average level before the real estate boom in the 2015-16 period thanks to a series of measures to raise borrowing costs and tighten mortgage rules for owners of multiple homes.
Household loans by banks grew an average 3 trillion won on-month in June during the 2010-14 period, compared with an average of 7.3 trillion won in 2015-16 and 6.2 trillion won in 2017.

The income gap in Korea widened again in the second quarter, a serious blow to the so-called income-led growth policy of the Moon Jae-in government, which vowed to narrow the inequality in earnings between the rich and poor.
According to data released by Statistics Korea on Thursday, earnings for households in the first quintile of income brackets, the bottom 20 percent of the population, retreated 7.6 percent in the second quarter compared to a year earlier.
Households in the second and third quintile also saw their incomes fall by 2.1 and 0.1 percent - whereas the rich folk kept getting richer.
The average income for people in the fourth quintile went up by 4.9 percent and for the fifth quintile by 10.3 percent.
A similar trend was spotted from January to March this year, when people in the first and second quintile experienced 8.0 and 4.0 percent drops in their incomes while people in the fourth and fifth quintiles saw gains of 3.9 and 9.3 percent compared to the previous year.
The total distribution ratio for disposable income - a barometer of earnings equality - was 5.23, which means the earnings of those in the fifth quintile were 5.23 times higher than those in the first quintile.
That figure indicates that the Korean economy is facing the worst level of income inequality since 2008 when the ratio for the period of April to June came to 5.24.
Officials from the Finance Ministry blamed the aging of Korea’s society and other long-term problems such as ongoing slumps in certain sectors like shipbuilding.
“The Korean economy is suffering from a lack of domestic demand [for goods and services], a result of massive restructuring we have seen in the manufacturing sector since 2015,” said Park Sang-young, a director at Statistics Korea. “It seems like this situation is taking a toll on those in the first quintile of the income group.” Statistics Korea is run by the Finance Ministry.
The statistics agency explained that the number of employed in households in the first quintile has shrunk from 0.83 per household last year to 0.68 per household this year, an 18 percent fall.
For households in the fifth quintile, on the other hand, the number of workers rose from 1.99 per household last year to 2.09 this year, a five percent increase.
But the data released on Thursday coupled with a jobs report from last week - which showed only 5,000 jobs being added to the economy in July - has deeply troubled some analysts.
Some economists are blaming the Moon administration’s relentless push to raise the minimum wage for the worsening situation.
Its logic is that by pushing up the minimum wage, workers in the first and second quintiles would see their income go up, which was supposed to make workers wealthier, willing to spend more and meant to translate into greater hiring by businesses.
But the effect has been much less hiring of workers than in the past, particularly in minimum wage jobs, and a measurable widening of the income gap.
“The drastic hike in the minimum wage has little impact on those in the upper group of the income bracket,” said Yun Chang-hyun, a professor of business at the University of Seoul. “But for those in a more vulnerable position, it robs them of their jobs.”
Kim Dong-yeon, Korea’s finance minister and deputy prime minister for the economy, said on Thursday during a budget meeting at the National Assembly that the government will propose a budget plan next year that contains “the biggest budget allocated for jobs in history.”

"I believe that pipe smoking contributes to a somewhat calm and objective judgement in all human affairs." -Albert Einstein, 1950
"Resurrection Man" is an obsolete term now, thank God, but it is still one that interests me. I first heard it when my father described the Robert Louis Stephenson story "The Body Snatcher". My father and I have a particular affinity for Stephenson which coalesced mainly over Treasure Island which was a particular favourite. We both still maintain that all really great books contain a map.
I recall in my mid twenties, the particularly shocking moment, when Dad having told me that it was time for me to inherit his collection of Stephenson's, brought me down to the library that he kept in the basement and we discovered that it had been burgled.
I have slowly begun to reconstitute that library which has been a wonderful opportunity to re-read those Stephenson's that I had forgotten. Re-reading "The Bodysnatcher" brought a classic horror film to mind. Boris Karloff is often only remembered today for his portrayal of Frankenstein's monster, but I think his performance in this RKO classic is as fine a thing as you could find. A compelling testament to the power of pure acting ability.
It has occurred to me that being an archaic term, Resurrection Man requires some explanation. In the early 19th century, there was a serious shortfall in the number of cadavers required for medical training and no legal way for medical schools to get their hands on bodies for the teaching of anatomy. As a result, there grew up an illicit trade in body snatching, where grave robbers or "resurrection men" as they were known would steal bodies to supply the medical schools.
Two Irishmen, Burke and Hare, are the most famous examples of the breed - though to be fair they were not representative. Grave robbing was a comparatively minor crime at the time and Burke and Hare decided to cut out the middleman and began to indulge in a spot of murder, sixteen in total, to supply their customers.
Resurrection Man is also the name of a powerful novel by Irish crime writer Eoin McNamee about the Shankhill Butchers, a particularly nasty chapter in our history. McNamee is a fine writer and his prose has a sort of hallucinatory clarity that I always find compelling. He's written several other books of Irish crime and is well worth tracking down.
There's been something of a celebration of Star Wars online over the last few days which is no bad thing. I rather like Star Wars, at least the first three films. They have a bravura and sense of old fashioned story telling that is completely lacking in the second three. I think the problem with the second set of films is that they set out to be good Star Wars films rather than good films or even good science fiction films. There comes about where the entire enterprise becomes so self referential as to be completely pointless.
What is definitely lacking is the edge present in the great Space Opera that inspired the films. The "planetary romance" has a bit of a bad name in science fiction circles, but I think that there is a lot of fine work in that field and none better than that of Catherine Lucille Moore. CL Moore wrote some of the finest science fiction that I have ever read and some of her best tales concern Northwest Smith, a Sam Spade of the Spaceways, who slouches through a Burroughsian Solar System with a heat ray on his hip.
Probably the best known of her stories is Shambleau, which isn't available online, so you will have to track a hard copy down. This is high quality story telling in the old style, told with a lightness of touch and eye for human folly that leaves it as sharp and surprising as it was when it was first written.
Terry Eagleton is an odd fish, I often disagree with him, but his concision and most of all his humour would make it a sin to deny him a hearing. I read him recently and came across the following passage, which I rather liked.
"The Kantian imperative to have the courage to think for oneself has involved a contemptuous disregard for the resources of tradition and an infantile view of authority as inherently oppressive."
There's quite a bit to be said for that approach to my mind, but today I observed a tradition that is a little odd. It's not a tradition of my family, but rather of Mrs. Kinch's. On the the sixth of May 1882, an ancestor of Mrs Kinch's was working in the Vice Regal Lodge in the Phoenix Park, when a group of men known as "The Invincibles" attacked Lord Frederick Cavendish and Thomas Burke, slashing both men to death with surgical blades. Burke was the intended target of the attack and the attackers were eventually caught and convicted, through the work of Superintendent John Mallon, and several were hung.
Mrs Kinch's ancestor observed the aftermath and helped carry the bodies inside. Curiously enough, he then returned to the site and cut a small cross into the turf and marked it with a flower that he had taken from the lodge. On the anniversary each year a member of the family returns (I suspect a few have been missed) and places a flower on the spot.
There is official site marked with a small cross of white stones, but family legend places the actual site some distance from there. I sloped up to the Park and paid my respects to Lord Cavendish and Mr. Burke this afternoon.
Enjoyed your post . . . but RLS's last name is spelled with a "v", not a "ph". I'm from the Monterey, California area where he lived for some time.
I forgot to mention that I really like the tradition of Mrs. Kinch's family. . . . and I'm glad that you got to be a part of it.
At one time C.L.Moore was married to Henry Kutter who was one of my favourite authors - although, to be fair, I have a lot of favourite authors.
"We both still maintain that all really great books contain a map." I agree wholeheartedly with this! :)
A great post, Conrad. I am certainly a subscriber of the view that a map definitely helps any book up a notch, and is frequently present in the books I love. There's a whole blogpost about maps in books somewhere, I am sure!
As for the nod to tradition....well done Sir! Walking through Smithfield this morning, I noticed someone had also placed some fresh wild heather on the memorial to William Wallace. Thoughts, memories and actions such as that, and Mrs Kinch's family tradition, enhance the world for all of us.
Sounds like a good read. If you like resurrection men stories - give The Edinburgh Dead by Brian Ruckley a try - if you haven't already.
A very fine and eclectic roudup, young Kinch. First, thank you for reminding me of C.L. Moore. I had a dog-eared copy of her prose for many years, sadly discarded, and I remember her novella "The Vintage Season" as proof that SF could be highly literary. It is a pity she's not as well known as her contemporaries, and the same could be said of her characters, including the wonderful Jirel of Joiry. Moore would have been a fascinating dinner companion.
Eagleton was much in vogue when I was in grad school in 80s/90s, though his Marxism was often disparaged by those in the frivolously nihilistic camp of French theory, which seemed to hold that nothing meant anything, so we might as well have fun talking about it. I didn't realize TE had taken on the New Atheists in his old age. Has he gone back to his Catholicism? I must look into that.
It is quite wonderful that Mrs. Kinch (and, be delegation, yourself) keeps that family tradition alive. I quite agree with Sidney. I once found myself strolling through Baltimore and coming across the grave of Poe, where, in proof of all the stories I had heard, there was indeed a fresh red rose.
This band may be the best kept secret in the seacoast! They don't have any CDs and they aren't on YouTube yet, but in case you hadn't noticed....
Hank & Dixie Baxter are the old-time country alter-egos of Harvey Reid & Joyce Andersen. The couple's love for classic country music found an outlet when they got together with the Knotty Pine Boys, a collection of all-star seacoast side-men. Harvey was raised in the south and cut his teeth on the golden oldies of country music and Joyce's first fiddlin' gig was with Boston's late country legend John Lincoln Wright and the Sour Mash Boys which then led her to a year playing country music out of Nashville TN, riding a tour bus and wearing a cowboy hat. When they get together for a rare Knotty Pine Boys show their love for the music is infectious.
They don their western clothing and play hits from the golden era of country music. Songs from Merl Haggard, Patsy Cline, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Hank Williams, Dolly Parton and the like.With their sweet vocal harmonies backed by soaring pedal steel, spare drums, bass, and rockin' fiddle, it's always refreshing to step back in time and spend an evening with this band.
If you don't know Harvey Reid & Joyce Andersen's music you can ramble around their websites (Joyscream Music & Woodpecker Records) or find them out there on iTunes and the like. They are life long musicians with deeps roots in a wide range of American music. Between the two of them they've made over 30 albums ranging from folk & blues to country & Americana and jazz & bluegrass. They have traveled the country and the world playing their original takes on American music as well as their own songs.

Standing upright, especially to deliver a speech. Come on then, stand up on your hind legs and say a few words about this company you've helped create! Forgive me if I seem nervous, but I'm not used to standing on my hind legs in front of a large group of people.

You are here: Home \ Challenges \ Donald Trump as president of the United States of America \ Problem definition
List all concepts alphabetically here (everything from issues, facts, data sets, solutions, actions, criterias etc). Use faceted search to filter, sort and group items.
Interactive map mindmap like diagram here where users can browse the entire problem space using relations such as those between object, stakeholders, variables ... and anything else.
The problem statement will be very unclear in the start so revisit this sub section regularly. Re-examine the problem statement by asking:
This sub section is to provide a concise summary description of the problem that can used in communicating with others outside your problem solving team.
The problem statement is usually a one sentence claim that outlines the problem that this challenge addresses.
Donald Trump, a serial liar, short termpered narcissist, a bullying con artist, adulterer, professed grabber of women’s genitals without their permission, an ignorant who does not read, an admirer of dictators, encourager of vigilante violence against innocent people, a person known to rip of his employees and break business contracts, a racist landlord, the preferred candidate of neo-Nazis, and a person who incites violence against his political opponents, is now the 45th president of the United States of America.
Try to include as much as you can about the context, the current situation (phenomenon), critical elements and unique features in the description using just one paragraph.
Include all possible negative effects by viewing the problem from different perspectives. (e.g. sectors, disciplines, domains etc)
View the problem from the angle of an artist, poor person, capitalist, woman, old person, psychologist, scientist, owner, religious person and all other roles you can up with.
What's the imbalance? Look at different levels. Is there imbalance on the level of the self, person to person relation, in teams, in an organization, among constituents or at the level of eco-systems.
While you add these negative consequences make sure to check the underlying assumptions that you hold about the nature of those issues. The most effective and efficient way to surface these assumptions is to ask questions of yourself, key decision-makers, and other important stakeholders through structured interviews.
At this stage you do not need to analyse and establish cause and effect. Such analysis is reserved for later stages. The negative effects can be seen as hypotheses for us to prove later in the Koios problem solving process.
Before one starts to solve a problem one needs to make sure it is actually a problem. The list of negative effects can be seen as reasons for why we should try to solve the problem. If there are no real significant negative aspects of this "problem" then it is not a really a problem.
Over 2,500 educators described specific incidents of bigotry and harassment that could be directly traced to Trumps presidential election rhetoric in a study conducted among 10,000. The study that ...
Is it an unanswered question that may result in large innovations or other great benefits if answered?
For online sources that does not have page numbers. Use a paragraph number, or cite the heading and the number of paragraphs following it.
Find positive aspects/effects by viewing the problem from different perspectives such as by group, sector, discipline, domain etc.
In this section you can add positive aspects of the situation. What are the positive things that the current system is supporting?
Even though most people view the situation as a problem, there are probably also positive effects of the situation. To get a full perspective we must consider both the positive and the negative sides.
Decide on the scope based on the resources you think you can gather or already have at your disposal.
Choose a level/threshold. For example if your challenge is World Poverty you may decide to focus on all kinds of poverty (including relative poverty) or narrow it down to extreme poverty.
It might be a good idea to ask stakeholders where they would draw the line and what other stakeholders they think should be included or left out.
Select a scope/boundary, iterate through the problem and reflect on the associated meanings entailed by the boundary frame. Each boundary has different values, actions, and possible effects.
You might disagree with the scope that has the majority vote. Your position may be that you should go more wide or narrow in your inquiry and problem solving. In this case you can always try to being
The scope should be sufficiently open to include the essential cause–effect relations that a single causality approach would exclude. A wider scope will enable you to incorporate the views of more people. Keep in mind that a wider scope means more time and resources. It also means more complexity which will lead to more challenging problem solving.
The scope defines the boundary of this challenge. It helps us to decide how ambitious we want to be. Higher ambitions mean more time and resources.
By defining the scope it also becomes easier for others to create other challenges that do not overlap with this.
By defining a scope we are able to limit the work into something that can be solved. This is important because you can't expect to analyse everything about the problem.
We can never understand everything about the world and we cannot solve all the world's problems at once.
We have to be realistic. It is going to take a lot of effort to solve a complex problem. This section helps to narrow down the challenge into a manageable project.
The scope of this analysis is Trump's character, leader style and personality, and what that does to the US and the rest of the world, him being the president of the most powerful country in the world. This challenge space is not about the policies he stands for but rather how his conduct and retoric negatively impacts society.
With a larger scope you may have too much work and things will become to complex to get anywhere. With a too narrow focus you may not solve the root causes and you may just be creating short term solutions that never solves the real problem at all.
The focusing question should be one single question. At this stage you should aim to create a single coherent and simple focusing question. Breaking it down in several "research" questions are meant for later stages of the process.
What is our ultimate goal? (To formulate an ideal goal you may try to think of what the world would be like if the problem was nonexistent.)
Do not use this section for your teams research questions. Instead formulate it from the perspective of the public.
The focusing question can be seen as the purpose of this challenge space. It describes what it is that we would like to see changed regarding the social problem at hand.
To formulate a focusing question you may try to take the problem statement and turn it into a question.
What should be done to avoid candidates with similarly poor character getting elected in the future?
The focusing question is written as a question. For example: How can we reduce / increase / remove ...
The rich picture should contain the main topics and the main people, organizations and activities/programmes. Identify stakeholders, insitutions, organizations, groups, artifacts, conditions, physical resources, phenomena, stocks (things that are accumulated and can increase or decrease)
Use nodes to represent the key concepts you found above. Label each element in the drawing using nouns.
Use arrows to depict linkages, relationships or flow between nodes. What is being tranferred, exchanged etc. Add a label on the arrow.
Depict the climate - what are people feeling and thinking? Are people outraged or is there a sense of apathy?
Depict the environment such as external interested parties and various factors affecting the situation.
To maintain reasonable size for presentation purposes, the ratio of nodes to links should be approximately 1.5.
Don't make the picture too complicated or it will fail to work as a communication tool. Include what is most important.
Rich pictures are used to provide a model for thinking about the system and to help gain an appreciation of the problem situation.
It also works as a useful artifact for discussing the problem in groups such as with different stakeholders.
Provide a summary text and image. Make it memorable. This section is intended for communicating the problem to others. Try to give an overview of the most important issues.
Add a content item for each word that people may not completely understand or agree to the meaning of.
Definition of terms is a mini dictionary. It is here to make sure everyone knows what exactly the different concepts mean.
This section can be seen as a vocabulary for the problem. As with most things in the world, many things have many names and different meanings in different contexts to different people.
This definition of terms helps to clarify what this problem solving team mean with words that otherwise could be ambiguous and cause communication problems.

CLEVELAND, OH (WOIO) - It sure feels like the Indians should sweep this series, but it sure felt like the Yankees would win Game 2 after they took an 8-3 lead. They'll have to play to sort it out.
The day off on Saturday helped rest the bullpens, but they still threw a lot on Friday New York's has been leaned on twice recently, the Tuesday game in Minnesota was the first.
Their backs are to the wall. Terry Francona is more likely to let Carlos Carrasco try to figure things out if he gets in trouble, Joe Girardi probably can't do that with Masahjro Tanaka.
Tanaka is a much better pitcher here in New York. His ERA is 3.22 home vs. 6.48 on the road. Carrasco happens to be better on the road too, but his ERA 3.99/2.65 road/home split is less dramatic.
I am most interested to see how Girardi handles it if Tanaka gets in trouble early. Can he afford to go to that heavily taxed bullpen? Can he afford not to? We'll see.

Post here for all your gear questions, rants and raves. Ask about gear before you buy it and find out what others are using. NOTE: this forum is NOT for gear sales.
Ok, so I'm planning on buying a harness, but I'm a bit torn between the Petzl Sama, Adjama and Caldaris, maybe even the Corax, but primarily those 3.
Any tips or experience with either of the gear? (I plan on doing all sorts of climbing, not just climbing walls)
All good models that you mention in your post, if you're starting out then a harness with adjustable leg loops is recommended - what other sorts of climbing have you got in mind?
I plan on doing on doing Trad, Sports, bottom-rope and indoor. Pretty much, I want a harness that can do all that.
Correction, I meant to say that I have a Corax (not an Adjama - I did have one once) - and based on what you are saying I would recommend the Corax.
Just curious, why do you recommend the Corax? And what do you use the Sama for (Apparently the Adjama is just a Sama with adjustable leg loops)?
I've had all the above-mentioned harnesses, albeit from different "generations". You won't go wrong with an Adjama. More comfy and better made than the Corax, with a better guaranteed fit than the Sama. If the Sama fits you perfectly, go for it by all means, but the Adjama will be that little bit more versatile.
The Corax is more comfortable (padded), more versatile (because of the adjustable leg loops). Advantages are that your friends can use it (more comfortably), you can wear thicker pants when trad climbing in Winter. The gear loops are designed for trad (the Sama not so much).
I use my Sama (which is designed specifically for Sport climbing) for hardcore sports climbing (where the 150g less weight makes all the difference on my grade 18 redpoint It also doesn't absorb sweat as much as the Corax!
Toni swears by her BD (not sure what model) and I think it sucks. The most comfy harness I've had, was the Beal Aero Classic. Only drawback was that it was just that little too big for me, even on the smallest adjustments.
Tygereye is right, comfort is the most important thing! Personally I find the BD harnesses to be much more comfortable than the Petzl harnesses but that's not true for all my friends. People are all built differently and so different harness will suit different people better. Justin is spot on with the adjustable leg loops, make it much nicer. The new BD Momentum has the easiest to adjust leg loops I've encountered yet.
Haha. Some people call it top rope. The one you commonly use in climbing gyms, where the rope goes through the pulley at the top and the belayer stands at the bottom. But i guys it doesnt matter. Any harness would actually work for that.
I had a corax but later bought a bd... Can't remember the model name but it's designed for longer routes. many manufactures are focused on weight which is useful for the serious pros but when your trying to work a route and you're hanging in it comfort is what you really want. Buy something with good padding
We (in the shop) generally insist that climbers hang in the harness first - a harness that is good for one is not necessarily good for another.
The Corax is more comfortable (padded), more versatile (because of the adjustable leg loops). Advantages are that your friends can use it (more comfortably)...
Its by far our # 1 seller because of it's wide adjustment range (it only comes in 2 sizes, #1 and #2. so it fits a wide variety of people);
yes you can hang in all of them in our shop. but you won't feel the difference between brand A and B when you hang in it for just 2 minutes.
i currently own 3 different harnesses from 3 different manufacturers and i can't really tell the difference after hanging in them for 8 hours in a multipitch trad route.
the differences are often subtle like gear loops and for a beginner that's not really going to matter.
Are there any other harnesses you guys would recommend? Apparently the Adjama wears really fast, and I dont like the idea of prematurely retiring the harness. What about Black diamond or some other makes?
My corax has been pretty durable. Haven't had too many issues with it. Except that the gear loops aren't so great for trad.
At some point you WANT your stuff to need replacing...buying gear is awesome ... except with the current exchange rate

From one of the country’s most recognizable journalists: How becoming a grandmother transforms a woman’s life.
After four decades as a reporter, Lesley Stahl’s most vivid and transformative experience of her life was not covering the White House, interviewing heads of state, or researching stories at 60 Minutes. It was becoming a grandmother. She was hit with a jolt of joy so intense and unexpected, she wanted to “investigate” it—as though it were a news flash. And so, using her 60 Minutes skills, she explored how grandmothering changes a woman’s life, interviewing friends like Whoopi Goldberg, colleagues like Diane Sawyer (and grandfathers, including Tom Brokaw), as well as the proverbial woman next door.
Along with these personal accounts, Stahl speaks with scientists and doctors about physiological changes that occur in women when they have grandchildren; anthropologists about why there are grandmothers, in evolutionary terms; and psychiatrists about the therapeutic effects of grandchildren on both grandmothers and grandfathers.
Throughout Becoming Grandma, Stahl shares stories about her own life with granddaughters Jordan and Chloe, about how her relationship with her daughter, Taylor, has changed, and about how being a grandfather has affected her husband, Aaron.
In an era when baby boomers are becoming grandparents in droves and when young parents need all the help they can get raising their children, Stahl’s book is a timely and affecting read that redefines a cherished relationship.
A deadly bombing takes Navajo Tribal cops Bernadette Manuelito, Jim Chee, and their mentor, the legendary Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn, back into the past to find a vengeful killer in this riveting Southwestern mystery from the bestselling author of Spider Woman’s Daughter and Rock with Wings.
When a car bomb kills a young man in the Shiprock High School parking lot, Officer Bernadette Manuelito discovers that the intended victim was a mediator for a multi-million-dollar development planned at the Grand Canyon.
But what seems like an act of ecoterrorism turns out to be something far more nefarious and complex. Piecing together the clues, Bernadette and her husband, Sergeant Jim Chee, uncover a scheme to disrupt the negotiations and inflame tensions between the Hopi and Dine tribes.
Retired Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn has seen just about everything in his long career. As the tribal police’s investigation unfolds, he begins to suspect that the bombing may be linked to a cold case he handled years ago. As he, Bernadette, and Chee carefully pull away the layers behind the crime, they make a disturbing discovery: a meticulous and very patient killer with a long-simmering plan of revenge.
Writing with a clarity and grace that is all her own, Anne Hillerman depicts the beauty and mystery of Navajo Country and the rituals, myths, and customs of its people in a mystery that builds on and complements the beloved, bestselling mysteries of her acclaimed father, Tony Hillerman.
If you cannot answer the first three questions immediately with an euphoric YES and if the fourth question gets your stomach turning, THIS is the place to be for you right now.
Are you ready to grow, to discover your full potential and to create a life that gives you an abundance of success, satisfaction, joy and freedom in all it’s glory? There’s only one thing left to say: Welcome to Holistic You!
It’s scientifically proven that most people do not even develop/live a minimum of their actual potential; so they scale down their desires and opportunities to the necessary minimum.
This article on personal development will explain it’s definition and role in our life, as well as the meaning and strategies of how you might be able to become the best version of yourself.
Personal development is about the progressive enhancement and development of an individual being. Meaning, your mindset, behaviour and expression are developed in a way that allow you to reach the most ideal vision of a successful, content and happy personality.
You focus on your strengths and learn how to handle your critical and negative thinking patterns, set clearly defined goals that are worthy to work towards; you settle success-oriented habits and routines, plus you’ll start – step by step – to come into your creative power, to savour and enjoy the full potential that lies within yourself!
Let’s not forget that this is a continuous process without a defined end point. Confuzius said once so beautifully and truthfully:
This journey is probably – or for sure – the most exciting one you’ll ever experience: it is the journey of YOUR LIFE.
You’ll gain more self-confidence, serenity, you’ll learn how to deal with problems in an adequate way as well as how to think and act solution-oriented with a healthy portion of optimism. Your charisma, your communication skills, your social interaction with fellow beings, your independence and your self-image will increase.
The answer may be a very individual one and therefore will differ between each of us. Some would say it’s (financial) wealth, some would define it as being recognised and free.
My personal definition may be as follows: success means being able to do anything that gives me joy, freedom and fulfilment from morning to sundown; that serves me as well as other beings; where I can aid, assist, inspire, and motivate others and spread my love to as many hearts as I can.
So – before you start creating your own successful life, it requires your definition of success, as a first step.
Success is often automatically associated with professional highs, achievements or accomplishments. But if you start working on your personality, not only will your behaviour and way of expressing yourself change within your job. More than that, you will make room for a holistic development that includes a variety of different aspects of life; to say the least your private life. These areas of life may include:
Now, as you’ve gone through this list, I’d request you to assess every single aspect on a scale from 1 to 10 (1 = miserable, 10 = absolutely successful) …
So, how does your result look like? Probably, there is still room for improvement in one or another area, isn’t there?
Are you ready to embark on the journey towards discovering yourself? Are your ready to embrace your inner power? It’s my honour to join you on this trip!
What are your habitual behaviours and routines that you’re displaying, every single day? Are they supporting you in finding your own path and mission in this world? A path that gives you joy and fulfilment?
Habits are an essential tool in the process of personal development; for everything we practice, do and think regularly, will be manifested in our sub-consciousness. Our convictions are reflected in the outside, because we implement these manifestations. If we program our sub-conscious mind with deliberate, promising habits, we’ll see the results very soon in our life.
It definitely will demand discipline, overcoming and persistence on one day or another, at least in the beginning; but in the end you’re investing in YOURSELF, in YOUR development, in YOUR health, in YOUR long-term goals and success. You’ll thank yourself at the end of the day.
Excellent indicators of your growth potential are your fears. That may sound a little unattractive and intimidating at first, doesn’t it?
Fears are a natural, evolutionary protective mechanism that often stands in the way of our pursuit for personal development. Fear stops us in the long run from getting out of our comfort zone, meaning our accustomed, familiar situation and behaviour. And of course, the first step out of this comfort zone may seem unpleasant at first – but only then can we allow new doors to open up for us and new opportunities to come our way. New perspectives in our life, that enrich and empower us.
This journey is a slow, but progressive step-by-step process. We all do have fears. So, why not support each other to face unreasonable fear and to go one step FURTHER in order to grow beyond our potentials.
The term “personal development” can be defined as the process of striving to unfold your full potential in all aspects of life. The aim is to seek for the optimal and best version of yourself in order to gain better results in different areas of your life and to get up every single morning with an abundance of excitement, gratitude and vitality for what lies ahead.
Do you want to create a life that matches your deepest wishes and dreams? There is a mighty potential within yourself that is just waiting to be awakened and expressed. Come into your power and develop into the best version possible.
This developing process will not always be a gentle walk in the park; but you’ll only grow and mature through facing the challenges life throws at you.
So, become inspired by my practical tips and precious knowledge. I’m looking forward to our shared journey on discovering a potential that lies dormant within all of us.

Launch Story empowers people with a WILL to do something substantial and provides them with the means and ways to achieve that.
I decided to do the Jung typology test a few months ago. Surprising results came up..! Here’s what my score said- I am the INFJ type: Introverted iNtuitive Feeling Judging. I am:
INFJs are distinguished by both their complexity of character and the unusual range and depth of their talents. Strongly humanitarian in outlook, INFJs tend to be idealists, and because of their J preference for closure and completion, they are generally “doers” as well as dreamers. This rare combination of vision and practicality often results in INFJs taking a disproportionate amount of responsibility in the various causes to which so many of them seem to be drawn. (Me: *Cough” Well, I suppose I am talented to a certain extent. Modesty isn’t one of them. I’m surprised to know that I have a complex character. I’d always seen myself as the “what you see is what you get” type- transparent and rather straight. Responsibility: true enough. I tend to be a control freak in some way. Woe is the person who rearranges my books, or toiletries in the bathroom!)
INFJs are deeply concerned about their relations with individuals as well as the state of humanity at large. They are, in fact, sometimes mistaken for extroverts because they appear so outgoing and are so genuinely interested in people — a product of the Feeling function they most readily show to the world. (Me: You mean, I’ve been living a lie? That I’m not instinctively bubbly, cheery and extroverted? Who AM I?) On the contrary, INFJs are true introverts, who can only be emotionally intimate and fulfilled with a chosen few from among their long-term friends, family, or obvious “soul mates.” While instinctively courting the personal and organizational demands continually made upon them by others, at intervals INFJs will suddenly withdraw into themselves, sometimes shutting out even their intimates. This apparent paradox is a necessary escape valve for them, providing both time to rebuild their depleted resources and a filter to prevent the emotional overload to which they are so susceptible as inherent “givers.” As a pattern of behavior, it is perhaps the most confusing aspect of the enigmatic INFJ character to outsiders, and hence the most often misunderstood — particularly by those who have little experience with this rare type. (Me: Well, at least I’m rare and special. Can I also say, a dying breed?)
Due in part to the unique perspective produced by this alternation between detachment and involvement in the lives of the people around them, INFJs may well have the clearest insights of all the types into the motivations of others, for good and for evil. The most important contributing factor to this uncanny gift, however, are the empathic abilities often found in Fs, which seem to be especially heightened in the INFJ type (possibly by the dominance of the introverted N function). (Me: Fancy words for saying that INFJs tend to be suckers?)
This empathy can serve as a classic example of the two-edged nature of certain INFJ talents, as it can be strong enough to cause discomfort or pain in negative or stressful situations. More explicit inner conflicts are also not uncommon in INFJs; it is possible to speculate that the causes for some of these may lie in the specific combinations of preferences which define this complex type. For instance, there can sometimes be a “tug-of-war” between NF vision and idealism and the J practicality that urges compromise for the sake of achieving the highest priority goals. And the I and J combination, while perhaps enhancing self-awareness, may make it difficult for INFJs to articulate their deepest and most convoluted feelings. (Me: This is almost painful to read…)
Usually self-expression comes more easily to INFJs on paper, as they tend to have strong writing skills (Me: A-ha! Is this a sign? That I could be the next promising writer to emerge…?) Since in addition they often possess a strong personal charisma, INFJs are generally well-suited to the “inspirational” professions such as teaching (especially in higher education) and religious leadership. Psychology and counseling are other obvious choices, but overall, INFJs can be exceptionally difficult to pigeonhole by their career paths. Perhaps the best example of this occurs in the technical fields. Many INFJs perceive themselves at a disadvantage when dealing with the mystique and formality of “hard logic”, and in academic terms this may cause a tendency to gravitate towards the liberal arts rather than the sciences. (Me: This is true. I think I’m an arts person through and through. Give me art, music and writing anytime any ol’ day). However, the significant minority of INFJs who do pursue studies and careers in the latter areas tend to be as successful as their T counterparts, as it is *iNtuition* — the dominant function for the INFJ type — which governs the ability to understand abstract theory and implement it creatively (Me: Does this apply to a legal career, I wonder? A legal career is neither here nor there, not liberal arts nor sciences.)
In their own way, INFJs are just as much “systems builders” as are INTJs; the difference lies in that most INFJ “systems” are founded on human beings and human values (Me: Hear ye, hear ye!) rather than information and technology. Their systems may for these reasons be conceptually “blurrier” than analogous NT ones, harder to measure in strict numerical terms, and easier to take for granted — yet it is these same underlying reasons which make the resulting contributions to society so vital and profound (Me: Well, of course, the saviour of society, of humanity. As My Chemical Romance put it: “the saviour of the broken, the beaten and the damned”).

November 1st – AutoStore – the automatic choice Swisslog’s solution meets a growing need for flexible robotics
October 1st – Getting ready for Christmas Sara LBS’s advice on easing warehouse pressures this autumn
In our uncertain business climate one thing is for sure, there will always be a need for high quality temporary buildings from a reliable supplier. Rubb Buildings Ltd, based in Gateshead, has a forty-year history of satisfied customers across a variety of industry sectors, including manufacturing and warehousing and logistics, as well as sporting organisations and the armed forces.
In the warehouse and logistics sector the biggest call for Rubb’s products is as warehouse space solutions to ease the ongoing shortage of available storage space near existing premises. Rubb Buildings’ Steph Coyle, Sales Executive and Rubb Warehouse Specialist, spoke to Warehouse & Logistics News.
On a daily basis, I deal with enquiries and ongoing projects from a range of industries and professions such as architects, consultants, project managers and the end user client directly. I liaise with a lot of sub-contractors and I work with our in-house design team to develop the best solution to my clients’ needs.
WLN – Who else is in the Sales team with you? How are you geared up to service the warehouse and logistics sector?
Here in our sales team, along with myself, is our Sales Manager Andrew Knox, who has been with the company for 16 years, working in all departments of the business. My fellow colleague, business development and military sales specialist Grant Davidson, also works within the sales department along with our newest member of the team, Henry Robinson-Moore, who takes care of our service and maintenance department. Our team dynamics work very well with one another. We thrive on developing innovative and fresh ideas to bring to the table, reflecting the next key developments within our industry.
Our buildings are fabric-covered structures made of structural steelwork and PVC cladding, which offer a high quality, affordable, alternative solution to conventional warehouses. Our structures can often save around a third of the cost as opposed to a traditional build facility, likewise the running costs of our facilities can be reduced compared to traditional structures.
While often seen as a temporary solution to a storage space challenge, which we are happy to provide, our buildings are built to last, and can be a good investment for people with changing logistical and operational requirements. Our galvanized steel framework has a guarantee of 25 years and our PVC a guarantee of 10 years, with this in mind however we have structures still in use which were installed 40 years ago.
WLN – To expand on that, the UKWA, among others, have been commenting recently on the current lack of warehouse space in general in the UK. How do Rubb’s fabric building products support this need and solve people’s storage space challenges?
Our solutions are a great answer to this challenge. We can work together with the client to develop custom warehouse facilities with quick lead times as opposed to traditional build warehouses, in terms of both manufacture and installation. Our structures are also both adaptable and relocatable, as well as being cost effective compared to traditional facilities.
WLN – For people who haven’t come across your products before, what are the benefits of Rubb buildings?
The benefits of our buildings include fast design, manufacture and construction, with the flexibility to be adapted, modified, extended or relocated if needed.
We are market leaders within the tensile fabric building industry and our warehouse solutions are custom designed specifically for the geographic location in which they will be situated. We design our structures to all relevant standards and codes to deliver the highest quality UK manufactured facilities. We source many of our materials from local companies and we even galvanize our structural steelwork at a plant only five miles from our factory.
They can be custom designed to suit the site and climate controlled too. We can also offer additional products and services such as insulation options, maintenance plans and rental opportunities, if people need additional flexibility logistically or financially.
Back in 1981, Rubb was tasked by the RAF to assist in supplying military buildings during the Falklands conflict. It was here we cemented our name within the industry. We have since produced many innovative buildings for many sectors over the years, taking our portfolio from strength to strength, including many facilities within the storage industry such as fantastic structures for Belfast Harbour, Tradewood & Co and Harland and Wolff.
Our buildings are designed and manufactured here at our offices and manufacturing plant on the Team Valley Trading Estate in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear.
We offer a wide variety of structures ranging from pre-designed shelters to large storage facilities. In terms of size we can offer anything from a 3m span to 100m clear span structure. Costings of our facilities are tailored to each specific project, budgetary costings for facilities are available via contacting our sales department.
WLN – What are the most popular size buildings you provide in the warehouse and logistics sector? What’s the largest building you have supplied? And the tallest?
The most popular dimension range for storage facilities tends to be of a 30m span by a variety of lengths. The largest storage building which Rubb UK has supplied is for Tradewood & Co, located in Northern Ireland. This project is a triple link 101m span by 95m long, with a sidewall of 8m which provides an overall apex height of 12.9m high. This storage facility features a floor space of 9,595m2. The facility is used for timber storage and also features a 320m2 mezzanine floor for office space. The tallest facility we have provided to date is our first biomass fuel processing and storage facility for energy giant E.ON UK. The 31.5m span x 137.5m long building at Ironbridge Power Station, Shropshire, UK, has an apex height of 21m.
WLN – Can you tell us about your most noteworthy projects in recent times? Do you have customer case studies?
Within my personal project portfolio, my most noteworthy projects of late have been a custom warehouse facility for Belfast Harbour which was a 25m span x 77m long x 7m eaves. I have also recently handed over a smaller packaging warehouse facility, which featured a configuration of 15m span x 35m long x 6m eaves. Projects due for completion include a custom sports facility, which has just been erected in Northern Ireland for a new leisure scheme and I have just recently won a contract for a football training facility.
Myself or one of my fellow colleagues within the sales department would be the first point of contact to discuss the requirement and we will advise based on our previous knowledge and experience, to develop the best solution for the project.
We have a range of pre-designed shelter solutions which can be manufactured in a couple of weeks and erected in a matter of days. However, with regards to our custom structures, the element of lead time is very dependent on the configuration of the building required.
Rubb buildings require minimal maintenance. We hot dip galvanize our steelwork to protect against the elements and our PVC sheets have self-cleaning qualities. We offer a maintenance contract with all of our buildings in order to stay on top of any minor amendments which may be required.
WLN – And finally, what about the bigger picture? What kinds of customers do you have in other sectors?
Over the years Rubb Buildings has supplied aircraft hangars and storage buildings to the UK Ministry of Defence and other armed forces. In civilian life Rubb has distinguished itself as a trusted provider of temporary and permanent solutions for businesses and other organisations of all sizes needing extra space in a hurry, including ports, shipbuilders, airports, airlines, aircraft manufacturers, sports and emergency relief organisations. But even though those markets are growing, our customers in the warehousing and logistics sector will always be very important to us.

Are microwaves a benign bastion of convenience or a sinister contributor to biological and nutritional damage? A growing percentage of people are now heeding the advice of holistic health experts and disposing of their microwaves due to the dangers of microwaved food. Regardless of where you stand, humans are the only animals on the planet who destroy the nutritional value of their food before eating it, and the use of microwaves is no exception.
Microwaves are a source of electromagnetic energy (a form of nonionizing form of radiation) electronically generated. When penetrating the aliments, they trigger an inner rotation of the water molecules inside the food. This rotation triggers a friction between the molecules and the result is a rapid growth in temperature.
Microwaves use super-fast particles to literally radiate the contents of water inside food and bring it to boil. Not only has microwave use been linked to causing infertility in men, but it also denatures many of the essential proteins in the food making them virtually indigestible.
Most animals will only consume food in its natural, unprocessed state, but humans actually go out of their way to render food nutritionally worthless before eating it. Think about all the prepackaged and processed foods we purchase and consume annually. It’s no wonder the state of our health is in dire straits.
Microwave ovens work physically, biochemically and physiologically, producing ions and various free radicals, which destroy viruses and bacteria, but not toxins and microtoxins. The experts have concluded that food cooked in microwaves loses between 60% and 90% of its vital energy and, at the same time, the structural disintegration processes accelerates. Also, the nutrient substances are altered, leading to digestive diseases. These microwaves can increase both the number of cancerous cells in blood and the number of stomach and intestinal cancerous cells.
Microwaves leaking radiation is a serious issue. Serious enough for the FDA to set legal limits on the leakage permitted by every microwave manufacturer. However, the only way to completely eliminate the radiation dangers associated with microwaves is not to use one. Microwave radiation has been known to cause cataracts, birth defects, cancer and other serious illnesses.
Because of these causes the microwave ovens were banned in the Soviet Union in 1976. Soviet scientists found that the microwave exposure decreases the ability of some vitamins to by absorbed by the human body, dramatically accelerates the structural disintegration of all foods and reduces the metabolic stress of the alkaloids, glycosides and galactoses.
In 1991, the Swiss Doctor Hans Ulrich Hertel made a study that demonstrated that cooking or heating food presents much greater risks for health than the traditionally cooked food. He found that people who ate microwave prepared food recorded losses in the hemoglobines and lymphoites.
In 2003, a Spanish governmental study elaborated in Murcia demonstrated that the vegetables and fruits cooked in a microwave lost a percentage of 97% of the substances that contribute to reducing the incidence of coronary heart diseases.
In Dr. Lita Lee’s book, Health Effects of Microwave Radiation — Microwave Ovens, and in the March and September 1991 issues of Earthletter, she stated that every microwave oven leaks electro-magnetic radiation, harms food, and converts substances cooked in it to dangerous organ-toxic and carcinogenic products.
In Comparative Study of Food Prepared Conventionally and in the Microwave Oven, published by Raum & Zelt in 1992, at 3(2): 43, it states:
“Artificially produced microwaves, including those in ovens, are produced from alternating current and force a billion or more polarity reversals per second in every food molecule they hit. Production of unnatural molecules is inevitable. Naturally occurring amino acids have been observed to undergo isomeric changes (changes in shape morphing) as well as transformation into toxic forms, under the impact of microwaves produced in ovens.”
There are no atoms, molecules or cells of any organic system able to withstand such a violent, destructive power for any extended period of time, not even in the low energy range of milliwatts. Microwaves quickly destroy the delicate molecules of vitamins and phytonutrients (plant medicines) naturally found in foods. One study showed that microwaving vegetables destroys up to 97% of the nutritional content (vitamins and other plant-based nutrients that prevent disease, boost immune function and enhance health).
Dr. Hertel was the first scientist to conceive and carry out a quality clinical study on the effects microwaved nutrients have on the blood and physiology of the human body. His small but well controlled study showed the degenerative force produced in microwave ovens and the food processed in them. The scientific conclusion showed that microwave cooking changed the nutrients in the food; and, changes took place in the participants’ blood that could cause deterioration in the human system. Hertel’s scientific study was done along with Dr. Bernard H. Blanc of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and the University Institute for Biochemistry.
A breakdown of the human “life-energy field” in those who were exposed to microwave ovens while in operation, with side-effects to the human energy field of increasingly longer duration;
A degeneration of the cellular voltage parallels during the process of using the apparatus, especially in the blood and lymphatic areas;
A degeneration and destabilization of the external energy activated potentials of food utilization within the processes of human metabolism;
Degeneration and circuit breakdowns of electrical nerve impulses within the junction potentials of the cerebrum [the front portion of the brain where thought and higher functions reside];
A degeneration and breakdown of nerve electrical circuits and loss of energy field symmetry in the neuroplexuses [nerve centers] both in the front and the rear of the central and autonomic nervous systems;
Loss of balance and circuiting of the bioelectric strengths within the ascending reticular activating system [the system which controls the function of consciousness];
A long term cumulative loss of vital energies within humans, animals and plants that were located within a 500-meter radius of the operational equipment;
Long lasting residual effects of magnetic “deposits” were located throughout the nervous system and lymphatic system;
A destabilization and interruption in the production of hormones and maintenance of hormonal balance in males and females;
Markedly higher levels of brainwave disturbance in the alpha, theta, and delta wave signal patterns of persons exposed to microwave emission fields, and;
Because of this brainwave disturbance, negative psychological effects were noted, including loss of memory, loss of ability to concentrate, suppressed emotional threshold, deceleration of intellective processes, and interruptive sleep episodes in a statistically higher percentage of individuals subjected to continual range emissive field effects of microwave apparatus, either in cooking apparatus or in transmission stations.
Take a look around you at every person that still uses a microwave. The largest majority are unhealthy and overweight. The more you use the microwave, the worse your nutritional state gets, and the more likely you are to be diagnosed with various diseases and put on pharmaceuticals which, of course, will create other health problems that lead to a grand spiraling nosedive of health.
Of all the natural substances — which are polar — the oxygen of water molecules reacts most sensitively. This is how microwave cooking heat is generated — friction from this violence in water molecules. Structures of molecules are torn apart, molecules are forcefully deformed, called structural isomerism, and thus become impaired in quality. This is contrary to conventional heating of food where heat transfers convectionally from without to within. Cooking by microwaves begins within the cells and molecules where water is present and where the energy is transformed into frictional heat.
The following is a summary of the Russian investigations published by the Atlantis Raising Educational Center in Portland, Oregon:
Thawing frozen fruits converted their glucoside and galactoside containing fractions into carcinogenic substances.
Extremely short exposure of raw, cooked or frozen vegetables converted their plant alkaloids into carcinogens.
Russian researchers also reported a marked acceleration of structural degradation leading to a decreased food value of 60 to 90% in all foods tested. Among the changes observed were:
Various kinds of damaged to many plant substances, such as alkaloids, glucosides, galactosides and nitrilosides.
According to Dr. Lee, changes are observed in the blood chemistries and the rates of certain diseases among consumers of microwaved foods. The symptoms above can easily be caused by the observations shown below. The following is a sample of these changes:
Lymphatic disorders were observed, leading to decreased ability to prevent certain types of cancers.
Higher rates of digestive disorders and a gradual breakdown of the systems of elimination were observed.
Microwave exposure caused significant decreases in the nutritive value of all foods researched. The following are the most important findings:
A reduction in the metabolic behavior and integration process capability of alkaloids [organic nitrogen based elements], glucosides and galactosides, and nitrilosides;
This is kind of a misnomer because there is truthfully, with perhaps the exception of dehydration, no way to heat food and maintain its structural and nutritional value. However, gently heating food in a cast iron pan over the stove may be the healthiest alternative to nuking it. This is the old fashioned way and it never failed our ancestors.
Toss that microwave and strive to consume at least half of your diet from raw foods, that is a huge step in the right direction to maintain their nutritional value. My mother always used to tell me that if food comes from a package, or has to be heated to be eaten, there’s a good a chance it’s low in nutrition. She was right for the most part, so keep that in mind when venturing the aisles at the grocery.

Right out of high school, Barbara began to raise her strong voice regularly at demonstrations for racial equality and economic justice. From the mid-40s she became involved with the labor, civil rights and feminist movements. While still in her teens, she began to sit in with bands around town and won the interest of local music promoters.
She even got an offer to tour with Alvino Rey's band, but she turned it down in favor of singing at factory gates and in union halls. In 1949 she moved to San Francisco and began raising her own family and singing her folk and topical songs around town as well as on radio and early TV. The traditional jazz revival was then shaking the town, and by the mid '50s she became a familiar figure at clubs along the city's Embarcadero with her own versions of the classic women's blues and hot jazz tunes. She worked with Pete Seeger, Kid Ory, George Lewis, Turk Murphy and others, appearing at festivals and on television. Dane appeared at many prestigious venues and shared bills with distinguished performers, including Louis Armstrong, Memphis Slim, Lightnin' Hopkins (with whom she later recorded an album) and controversial comedian Lenny Bruce.
In 1959, she recorded with Earl Hines and toured with Jack Teagarden's band. In 1961 Barbara opened her own club, Sugar Hill: Home of the Blues, on San Francisco's Broadway, with the idea of creating a respectful venue for the music right on the tourist rialto where a wider audience could come in contact with it. There Dane performed regularly with her two most constant musical companions: Kenny "Good News" Whitson on piano and cornet, and Wellman Braud, former Duke Ellington bassist. She continued her high profile on television, radio and in concert, throughout the 60s and 70s. In 1966, Barbara Dane became the first U.S.
musician to tour post-revolutionary Cuba. The impact on the Cuban public was indelible, and she soon returned to take part in an international festival where she met other like-minded singers from all over the world. Through some of these singers, she was invited to tour in both Western and Eastern Europe, Mexico, Nicaragua, and the Far East, even to North Vietnam and the liberated areas of the South as the war still raged. Dane concentrated her musical efforts on singing at fund- and consciousness raising gatherings around the world.
Her decision to ally her singing to political causes has tended to keep her from the general audience. In 1970 Dane founded Paredon Records, with a deep commitment to making the music of the musicians and singers identified with the liberation movements then rocking the globe, many of whom she met during her travels, available to the U.S. listener. She produced 45 albums, including three of her own, over a 12 year period. The label was recently incorporated into Smithsonian-Folkways, a label of the Smithsonian Institution, and is available through their catalog.
In December of 1997 she gave a solo concert at the Casa de las Americas in Havana, Cuba as the wrap-up of a year-long celebration of the 30th Anniversary of the Encuentro de Cancion Protesta, a series which included Isabel y Ángel Parra of Chile and other international guest artists. Her son is Pablo Menendez, leader of the Cuban roots-jazz fusion group Mezcla; and her grandson is Osamu Menendez Santana, of the Cuban rock group Havana. Read more on Last.fm.

Kangaroos are big marsupials which are located handiest in australia - Health News by Date: MedlinePlus
They may be identified by their muscular tails, strong again legs, big feet, quick fur and long, pointed ears. Like every marsupials, a sub-sort of mammal, girls have pouches that incorporate mammary glands, where their young live until they may be antique enough to emerge.
Kangaroos are within the macropodidae own family, which also includes tree-kangaroos, wallabies, wallaroos, quokkas and pademelons. While people consider kangaroos, the 4 species that usually come to mind are within the genus macropus: the antilopine kangaroo, the crimson kangaroo, the western gray kangaroo and the japanese gray kangaroo. They may be from time to time referred to as the “superb kangaroos” due to the fact these species are an awful lot larger than different kangaroos.
However, there are 12 species of tree-kangaroos within the dendrolagus genus, in step with the integrated taxonomic data system. And, bettongs, in the potoridae own family, are known as rat-kangaroos.
The most important kangaroo, as well as the largest marsupial, is the purple kangaroo, according to countrywide geographic. The period from the purple kangaroo’s head to its rump is three.25 to five.25 feet (1 to 1.6 meters) lengthy. Its tail adds another 35.5 to 43.5 inches (90 to 110 centimeters) to its duration and its complete body weighs around two hundred lbs. (ninety kilograms).
Most kangaroos stay at the continent of australia, though each species has a distinct location it likes to call domestic. As an example, the musky rat-kangaroo likes to nestle down in little nests at the floor of the rainforests in northeastern queensland. Grey kangaroos like the forests of australia and tasmania, on the other hand. The antilopine kangaroo may be determined in the monsoonal eucalyptus woodlands of extreme northern australia. Tree-kangaroos stay inside the higher branches of trees in the rainforests of queensland, as well as on the island of latest guinea.
Kangaroos are the handiest huge animals that hop as a primary means of locomotion. Their springy hind legs and ft are lots more potent and large than their arms (or “forelimbs”). In line with the san diego zoo, kangaroos can cover 15 ft (7 m) in a unmarried hop and might hop as speedy as 30 mph (48 kph). Usually, 20 mph (32 kph) is taken into consideration their cruising speed. When feeding, kangaroos use a slower, walking motion, and for that they use their muscular tail as a type of 5th leg, pushing off the floor as they move alongside.
Kangaroos are social and stay in agencies referred to as a mob, a herd or a troop. Kangaroos in a mob will groom each different and guard each different from chance. If a kangaroo suspects there’s hazard within the vicinity, it will stomp its foot on the ground to alert others. If it comes to blows, a kangaroo will field and kick its opponent.
Probable the nice-recognised reality approximately kangaroos is that they carry their young in a pouch. A lady kangaroo is pregnant for 21 to 38 days, and she or he can deliver delivery to as much as 4 offspring at one time, even though that is uncommon.
At beginning, the toddler, referred to as a joey, can be as small as a grain of rice, or as big as a bee, at 0.2 to 0.Nine inches (five to 25 millimeters), consistent with the san diego zoo. While the joey is born, it’s far guided properly into the comfortable pouch, where it gestates for some other 120 to 450 days.
In the pouch, the joey is protected and may feed by way of nursing from its mom’s nipples. Joeys urinate and defecate in the mother’s pouch. The liner of the pouch absorbs a number of the mess, however once in a while the mother will need to smooth it out, which she does with the aid of inserting her lengthy snout into the pouch and the use of her tongue to cast off the contents. A younger joey will continue to be connected to a nipple while the mother does this, but any older ones might be briefly kicked out.
Every other exciting reality approximately the mom kangaroo is that she is capable of suckle joeys at exclusive developmental tiers on the equal time with milk that has exclusive nutritional content material, the the big apple times has stated.

Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency which is regarded as the world’s first decentralized digital currency. It was created by a pseudonymous person or persons named Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 and has since gone on to become the world’s most popular cryptocurrency by market cap. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency whose issuance is capped at a total supply of 21 million coins. Each Bitcoin can be divided into one million units, with the smallest unit of 0.00000001 known as a satoshi in homage to its creator. The distributed public ledger that Bitcoin uses to record transactions is known as a blockchain and Bitcoin can be spent at over 100,000 online merchants and can also be held as an investment. Bitcoin is traded for fiat and other cryptocurrencies on various exchanges but can also be used to facilitate p2p transactions. Each transaction incurs a small transaction fee to cover the cost of sending Bitcoin over the blockchain ledger, with the fee going to miners tasked with keeping the network secure.
The software delivers the work to the miners and receives the completed work from the miners and relays that information back to the blockchain. The best Bitcoin mining software can run on almost any desktop operating systems, such as OSX, Windows, Linux, and has even been ported to work on a Raspberry Pi with some modifications for drivers depending on the platform.
In the meantime, the basin’s miners are at full steam ahead. Salcido says he’ll have 42 megawatts running by the end of the year and 150 megawatts by 2020. Carlson says his next step after his current build-out of 60 megawatts will be “in the hundreds” of megawatts. Over the next five years, his company plans to raise $5 billion in capital to build 2,000 megawatts—two gigawatts—of additional mining capacity. But that won’t all be in the basin, he says. Carlson says he and others will soon be scaling up so rapidly that, for farsighted miners, the Mid-Columbia Basin effectively is already maxed out, in part because the counties simply can’t build out power lines and infrastructure fast enough. “So we have to go site hunting across the US & Canada,” Carlson told me in a text. “I’m on my way to Quebec on Monday.” As in oil or gold, prospectors never stop—they just move on.

The Bank for International Settlements summarized several criticisms of bitcoin in Chapter V of their 2018 annual report. The criticisms include the lack of stability in bitcoin's price, the high energy consumption, high and variable transactions costs, the poor security and fraud at cryptocurrency exchanges, vulnerability to debasement (from forking), and the influence of miners.[187][188][189]
Oct. 31, 2008: Someone using the name Satoshi Nakamoto makes an announcement on The Cryptography Mailing list at metzdowd.com: "I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party. The paper is available at http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf." This link leads to the now-famous white paper published on bitcoin.org entitled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." This paper would become the Magna Carta for how Bitcoin operates today.
Welcome to the Investopedia Bitcoin Center, where you can find the current price of Bitcoin as well as real-time updated news on the world’s most important cryptocurrency. For good or for ill, Bitcoin is being explored by every major world bank and may very well be the backbone of our global financial system in the near future. Use charts, watch videos, learn new Bitcoin related terms, and get all of your questions answered about Bitcoin here at Investopedia.
It would seem even early collaborators on the project don’t have verifiable proof of Satoshi’s identity. To reveal conclusively who Satoshi Nakamoto is, a definitive link would need to be made between his/her activity with Bitcoin and his/her identity. That could come in the form of linking the party behind the domain registration of bitcoin.org, email and forum accounts used by Satoshi Nakamoto, or ownership of some portion of the earliest mined bitcoins. Even though the bitcoins Satoshi likely possesses are traceable on the blockchain, it seems he/she has yet to cash them out in a way that reveals his/her identity. If Satoshi were to move his/her bitcoins to an exchange today, this might attract attention, but it seems unlikely that a well-funded and successful exchange would betray a customer's privacy.

In order to have an edge in the mining competition, the hardware used for Bitcoin mining has undergone various developments, starting with the use the CPU. The CPU can perform many different types of calculations including Bitcoin mining. In the beginning, mining with a CPU was the only way to mine Bitcoins and was done using the original Satoshi client. Unfortunately, with the nature of most CPU in terms of multi-tasking, and its optimization for task switching, miners innovated on many fronts and for years now, CPU mining has been relatively futile.
Generally speaking, every bitcoin miner has a copy of the entire block chain on her computer. If she shuts her computer down and stops mining for a while, when she starts back up, her machine will send a message to other miners requesting the blocks that were created in her absence. No one person or computer has responsibility for these block chain updates; no miner has special status. The updates, like the authentication of new blocks, are provided by the network of bitcoin miners at large.
Because of bitcoin's decentralized nature and its trading on online exchanges located in many countries, regulation of bitcoin has been difficult. However, the use of bitcoin can be criminalized, and shutting down exchanges and the peer-to-peer economy in a given country would constitute a de facto ban.[164] The legal status of bitcoin varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. Regulations and bans that apply to bitcoin probably extend to similar cryptocurrency systems.[165]
Charts can be a very useful tool for those looking to trade or invest in Bitcoin. Prices are available on numerous time frames, from as little as a minute to monthly or yearly charts. Short term traders may use shorter-term charts to try to profit from buying and selling of Bitcoin. Long-term investors may use charts to try to identify areas f support and resistance. When the market declines into support levels, investors may see that as a solid buying opportunity and look to buy Bitcoin on dips.
Early Bitcoin client versions allowed users to use their CPUs to mine. The advent of GPU mining made CPU mining financially unwise as the hashrate of the network grew to such a degree that the amount of bitcoins produced by CPU mining became lower than the cost of power to operate a CPU. The option was therefore removed from the core Bitcoin client's user interface.
Bitcoin Mining is a peer-to-peer computer process used to secure and verify bitcoin transactions—payments from one user to another on a decentralized network. Mining involves adding bitcoin transaction data to Bitcoin's global public ledger of past transactions. Each group of transactions is called a block. Blocks are secured by Bitcoin miners and build on top of each other forming a chain. This ledger of past transactions is called the blockchain. The blockchain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network as having taken place. Bitcoin nodes use the blockchain to distinguish legitimate Bitcoin transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere.
Unauthorized spending is mitigated by bitcoin's implementation of public-private key cryptography. For example; when Alice sends a bitcoin to Bob, Bob becomes the new owner of the bitcoin. Eve observing the transaction might want to spend the bitcoin Bob just received, but she cannot sign the transaction without the knowledge of Bob's private key.[14]
The whole process is pretty simple and organized: Bitcoin holders are able to transfer bitcoins via a peer-to-peer network. These transfers are tracked on the “blockchain,” commonly referred to as a giant ledger. This ledger records every bitcoin transaction ever made. Each “block” in the blockchain is built up of a data structure based on encrypted Merkle Trees. This is particularly useful for detecting fraud or corrupted files. If a single file in a chain is corrupt or fraudulent, the blockchain prevents it from damaging the rest of the ledger.
A wallet stores the information necessary to transact bitcoins. While wallets are often described as a place to hold[87] or store bitcoins,[88] due to the nature of the system, bitcoins are inseparable from the blockchain transaction ledger. A better way to describe a wallet is something that "stores the digital credentials for your bitcoin holdings"[88] and allows one to access (and spend) them. Bitcoin uses public-key cryptography, in which two cryptographic keys, one public and one private, are generated.[89] At its most basic, a wallet is a collection of these keys.
Bitcoin mining is a peer-to-peer process of adding data into Bitcoin’s public ledger in order to verify and secure a contract. Groups of recorded transactions are gathered in blocks and then added into the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin mining requires a lot of resources to protect the network from the possibility of altering past transaction data by making all attempts in changing blocks inefficient for the intruder. Bitcoin mining is rewarded by the network through transaction fees and subsidies of new coins to encourage miners to spend their resources on mining new Bitcoin blocks. As Bitcoin mining is increasingly difficult, it has become impossible to attempt mining as an individual. As a result, most Bitcoin mining is being done by mining pools, which include several participants sharing their reward. Bitcoin mining is controversial, as it is a great tool for securing transactions but complicating the scaling of the network.
While senders of traditional electronic payments are usually identified (for verification purposes, and to comply with anti-money laundering and other legislation), users of bitcoin in theory operate in semi-anonymity. Since there is no central "validator," users do not need to identify themselves when sending bitcoin to another user. When a transaction request is submitted, the protocol checks all previous transactions to confirm that the sender has the necessary bitcoin as well as the authority to send them. The system does not need to know his or her identity.
The basin has become a proving ground for the broader debate about the future of blockchain technology. Critics insist that bitcoin will never work as a mainstream currency—it’s slow and far too volatile. Its real function, they say, is as a “store of value”—that is, an investment asset, like gold or company shares—except that, unlike these traditional assets, bitcoin has no real underlying economic value. Rather, critics say, it has become merely another highly speculative bet—much like mortgage-backed derivatives were in the prelude to the financial crisis—and like them, it is just as assured of an implosion.
Bitcoin mining is so called because it resembles the mining of other commodities: it requires exertion and it slowly makes new units available to anybody who wishes to take part. An important difference is that the supply does not depend on the amount of mining. In general changing total miner hashpower does not change how many bitcoins are created over the long term.
Satoshi Nakamoto is credited with designing Bitcoin. Nakamoto claims to be a man living in Japan born on April 5th, 1975 but there are speculations that he is actually either an individual programmer or group of programmers with a penchant for computer science and cryptography scattered around the United States or Europe. Nakamoto is believed to have created the first blockchain database and have been the first to solve the double spending problem other digital currency failed to. While Bitcoin’s creator is shrouded in mystery, his Wizard of Oz status hasn’t stopped the digital currency from becoming increasingly popular with individuals, businesses, and even governments.
Electricity cost: How many dollars are you paying per kilowatt? You’ll need to find out your electricity rate in order to calculate profitability. This can usually be found on your monthly electricity bill. The reason this is important is that miners consume electricity, whether for powering up the miner or for cooling it down (these machines can get really hot).
Now that you’ve finished this extensive read, you should be able to answer this question yourself. Keep in mind that sometimes there might be better alternatives to Bitcoin mining in order to produce a higher return on your investment. For example, depending on Bitcoin’s price, it might be more profitable to just buy Bitcoins instead of mining them. Another option would be to mine altcoins that can still be mined with GPUs, such as Ethereum, Monero, or Zcash.
The counterargument is that the blockchain economy is still in its infancy. The “monetized code” that underlies the blockchain concept can be written to carry any sort of information securely, and to administer virtually any kind of transaction, contractual arrangement or other data-driven relationship between humans and their proliferating machines. In the future, supporters say, banks and other large institutions and even governments will run internal blockchains. Consumer product companies and tech companies will use blockchain to manage the “internet of things.” Within this ecosystem, we’ll see a range of cryptos playing different roles, with bitcoin perhaps serving as an investment, while more nimble cryptos can carry out everyday transactions. And the reality is, whatever its flaws, bitcoin’s success and fame thus far makes the whole crypto phenomenon harder to dislodge with every trading cycle.
The chief selling point of this hardware wallet is that you no longer have to write down several passphrases to recover your assets in case of an emergency. Rather, when you first setup the DigitalBitbox all this information is automatically stored on the SD card. No doubt, this has the potential to save many investors headaches in the future. Granted, you must still ensure that the SD card is kept somewhere safe and you should only ever have into inserted in the DigitalBitbox on setup or when resetting.
With the Antminers needing to stay below 38 °C, Mongolia is not the ideal location for a mining facility. It had been above 40 °C for several days when I visited in July. And in the winter, it can fall to –20 °C, cold enough for Bitmain to add insulation to the facilities. Dust is a problem as well, which is why the interior of every warehouse I walk through is veiled in a fine fabric filter.
Several deep web black markets have been shut by authorities. In October 2013 Silk Road was shut down by U.S. law enforcement[35][36][37] leading to a short-term decrease in the value of bitcoin.[38] In 2015, the founder of the site was sentenced to life in prison.[39] Alternative sites were soon available, and in early 2014 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that the closure of Silk Road had little impact on the number of Australians selling drugs online, which had actually increased.[40] In early 2014, Dutch authorities closed Utopia, an online illegal goods market, and seized 900 bitcoins.[41] In late 2014, a joint police operation saw European and American authorities seize bitcoins and close 400 deep web sites including the illicit goods market Silk Road 2.0.[42] Law enforcement activity has resulted in several convictions. In December 2014, Charlie Shrem was sentenced to two years in prison for indirectly helping to send $1 million to the Silk Road drugs site,[43] and in February 2015, its founder, Ross Ulbricht, was convicted on drugs charges and faces a life sentence.[44]
Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that allows payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. – Satoshi Nakamoto

Thanks to everyone’s positive response to our Baird Beer launch! We’ve decided to make this Japanese craft beer a permanent fixture at our JAB Bistro!
Baird Beer is a boutique craft brewery from Numazu, in Shizuoka Japan. Started in 2000 by the husband and wife team of Bryan and Sayuri Baird, they are dedicated to using the freshest, finest ingredients to create beer that bursts with flavour and character. They do this by only minimally processing the ingredients, so the natural flavours of the malt, hops and sugars end up in a deeply satisfying brew.
Here at JAB, reading about their passion for beer reminds us very much of our own passion for coffee. We are proud to have them on board (and on tap!) at our bistro. Do come and try this unique craft beer at our soft launch!
Japan is known to the world as the “Land of the Rising Sun.” To Japanese, Fuji-san (Mount Fuji) is a natural icon emblematic of the nation. Rising Sun Pale Ale is a beer emblematic of Japan’s legendary culture of craftsmanship.
This hoppy, brisk and refreshing Pale Ale is indescribably complex, but holds tenaciously to Japan’s prime aesthetic value – balance.
Hops are the spice of beer. They contribute bitterness, flavor and/or aroma to the finished beer depending upon the timing of their introduction into the hot wort or cold green beer. Generally speaking, hops added early to the wort boiling process contribute bitterness which provides a nice balance the malt-derived sweetness. Hops added late to the wort boil contribute diverse flavor and subtle aromatic characteristics. Hops also can be added after primary fermentation to the cold green beer in a traditional process known as Dry Hopping. Dry hopping is undertaken with one aim in mind – infusing the beer with aromatic hop oils and resins that produce an exquisite bouquet, often described as fruity, floral or spicy. Hops can be used by brewers in several forms, most notably Whole Flower Cones, pellets and extracts. Whole flower cones are hops in their most natural and minimally processed form. I believe the more you process something the more character you knock out of it. We use only whole flower cones in Baird Beer. This practice is old school and almost unheard of these days, but I believe wholeheartedly in the character superiority of the whole flower hop.
Rising Sun Pale Ale features whole flower hops grown mainly in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, a region known for the wonderful citrusy and piney character of its hops. Rising Sun Pale Ale is one of our signature dry hopped beers. I recommend it to anyone wanting to experience the glorious character that whole flower hops can impart to beer.
Baird’s boss Bryan is a long-time fan and admirer of musician Neil Young. His ‘single-take’ style of recording lends a raw, honest and unvarnished quality to his music. This is the quality in Baird Beer. The label artwork is inspired by a live 1989 Neil Young performance of ‘Rocking in the Free World.’
Music is the muse for many things, including this beer. Brewed un-cut and un-edited in ‘single-take’ batches, this Belgian-yeast fermented Session Ale is playful, effervescent and wonderfully aromatic.
Yeast is the transformative ingredient in beer. Brewers brew wort (sugar water derived from the mixing of water with milled grains at controlled temperatures); yeast ferments this wort (metabolizing the sugars and converting them to CO2, alcohol and tertiary flavor byproducts) transforming it to beer.
Beer yeast breaks down broadly into two categories: Ale (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Lager (Saccharomyces pastorianus). Within the world of Ale yeast there are countless strains and ones with a Belgian lineage tend to be very distinctive in the flavor byproducts they produce. Provocatively pleasant notes of fruit and spice are characteristic. In crafting Baird Beer, we choose not to filter the yeast out of the beer. It remains in the packaged beer where we put it to the task of fermenting a second time. This produces a tight, fine natural carbonation and also provides some protection against oxidative degradation of the beer over time.
Single-Take Session Ale, fermented as it’s with a yeast strain of Belgian Witbier lineage, showcases these distinctive fruity-spicy-peppery yeast-fermentation byproducts. Lower in alcohol and higher in hop flavor and aroma than most Belgian ales, Single-Take is a wonderfully sessionable example of the idiosyncratic world of Belgian yeast-fermented Ale.

I had so much fun writing some ways that you can spot a thief, I thought I’d continue with a few more ways that you and your teams can identify potential external theft. Remember, the very best way to Stop Shoplifting is to provide exceptional customer service. This scares off the crooks and keeps your customers coming back week, after week. So, without delay, here’s a few other ways that you can identify a probable shoplifter.
if it’s 90 degrees outside, and someone walks into the store wearing a heavy coat, chances are there wasn’t a sudden blizzard that you didn’t know about. I’ve caught several shoplifters who’ve told me that they thought that a heavy coat would block the Checkpoint Tags from sounding the alarm. Wrong. Just wrong on so many levels. So the next time that you see someone with a heavy parka and a beanie in the middle of summer, go offer some service; and perhaps a water.
it’s one thing to shop around the store, especially if you’re gift shopping, or maybe just killing time. I’m guilty of that, especially around lunch time. There is a line that can be crossed from simple wandering, to erratic behavior that should cue your Spidey Senses. Shoppers that almost run from department to department and grab whatever they can and toss it in the basket could be a red flag. Shoppers that seem “wired” or under the influence can also be strong indicators of a possible theft. Shoppers that bite your Checkpoint Tags should be a giant, waving red flag (that’s a story for another time). If you have a shopper exhibiting this behavior, then please, by all means, go offer some service; at your own risk… 
Most ladies carry a purse. To that point, the spectrum is pretty wide on what is carried in those purses. I know some that carry virtually everything needed for a three-day hike in the Himalia’s, where others stick to the bare essentials. What really should stand out to you is purses that are COMPLETELY flat. Purses that are folded up on top of a basket, or folded flat under the shopper’s arm. Chances are, if someone is bringing a completely empty purse into the store, they probably want to fill it with goodies.
Sometimes, shoplifters have to build up the courage to do the deed. If you want to Stop Shoplifting, you should be able to quickly identify this behavior. In this scenario the shoplifter takes a product, like clothing, or other items from the home location and brings them to an area of the store that is somewhat secluded. Perhaps they remove the Checkpoint Tags here, but the merchandise is then placed on the shelf, or hidden behind other product. This shoplifter may make this trip several times before going back and finally loading up before exiting. Pay attention to shoppers that do this and if you see it, get in there and provide some customer service!
This is a combination of the two indicators above. Take special note of shoppers that take items (clothing, small items, etc), fold them up and place them on top of their purse, which is in turn sitting on the top portion of their basket. I’ve seen this one a thousand time. This is usually a middle-age female, who may be a regular customer. She may spend a significant amount of money, but she’s also robbing you blind. By folding the product and placing it right on top of the purse, it can be concealed in a matter of seconds. ANY time I see this action in my store, I immediately provide the very best customer service. Often, I’ll remark on specific items that I see, so that the shoppers sees that I’m aware of what they are in possession of.
Remember, there are dozens of indicators that can alert you to a potential shoplifter, the end result to discourage them is always the same. Customer service can and will Stop Shoplifting. Train your teams to provide the best possible to everyone, and it will increase your sale and ultimately decrease shrink.

Warsash Local History Society was able to open the Heritage Centre at 24 Shore Road in 2011. Initial financing came from a legacy from the late Roy Knight and the Centre has subsequently been supported by a variety of fund raising activities; support from Fareham and Hampshire County Councils and donations for specific projects. Funds to support the rental of the premises are difficult to obtain and we now have to consider closing the Centre. We hope that this lottery might allow us to keep the Centre open for the immediate future whilst planning takes place to allow the archives to be accessed on line.
To enter the draw for the lottery we would ask participants to complete the form that can be downloaded from this page. The sum of £4.00 per month would acquire one entry for each of twelve draws. The draws would be made at the regular meetings of the Society which are held on the first Wednesday in April, June, October, December,and February. Half of the proceeds would be allocated to Prize money. The aim would be to achieve a 100 members which would mean prize money of £200.00 per month. In the meanwhile prize money would be half of the total raised at the time of each draw. It is envisaged that the first draw will be held at the April meeting of the Warsash Local History Society.

Today was day 3 of the vision screenings. We get more and more efficient with each day and I’m getting more and more comfortable with my Spanish, as I muddle through directions to the kids, who speak little to no English. When they understand me, and follow my directions, I’m always a bit surprised, as if I finally found the key that fits in the lock. No doubt that I sound like a 4 year old to them with my Spanish, but whatever I can get, I’ll take it. The one thing I’ve learned over the years is that if I’m ever going to become proficient at another language, I’ve got to be willing to toss the pride out the window and go for it. Children are far more honest in their responses to me that the adults are.
This is the first place I’ve volunteered where English is not taught in the schools, or at least not in this school. It may be different in higher grades, but not in the lower ones. Trying to understand the kids when they give me their name, then trying to find it on my roster, is the harder part of the screenings for me. Today, every other boy seemed to be either Sebastian or Cristian and they all have 3 names, which they say so quickly that it sounds like one name. When I finally think I’ve found their name, and will repeat it back to them in my own pronunciation, my words are often met with a giggle or a quick glance over to a friend. When I add “cerca?” (close?), I usually get a smile and a “si, cerca.” So much communication happens without any words…. especially with children.
I had some concerns the past two days as the boys, aren’t faring nearly as well on the screenings as the girls have, with about 1/3 of the boys failing. I’m reallly curious about this and will likely get an answer in the next few days when we accompany those who failed the screenings to the eye doctor either Thursday or Friday. I’ve got to wonder if they are confused with the testing or if they really do have vision problems. Basically, the students are to match what they see on the computer with letters on a card, while seated the appropriate distance away from the computer screen. They put on glasses that have one dark lens that they can’t see out of and the other with no lenses, to test one eye at a time. If they miss one or more out of the four letters, the next screen shows larger letters. The computer then gives a “pass” or a “fail” and those who fail will be the ones that will see an eye doctor.
Today there was a lot of down time with the kids who seemed to be “at recess” most of the morning. Lynette and Michelle got them going in copy cat type games with signing and mimicking superceeding all language barriers with a focus on the language we all know – laughter, which they do very well. We later learned that the kids were on an “extended recess” because their teachers had left the school. To do an errand? To go grab a snack or a coffee? No one seemed to know. They seemed to think that since we were there, we would tend to the kids, who fortunately were very well behaved in their absence. They did return a bit later.
There are only a handful of teachers at the school due to a teacher strike that is going on all over the country. It started in September and there’s not end in sight. The strike is over the high taxes the teachers pay when the businesses in the country pay no taxes at all. Unfortunately, it will be the kids who will bear the brunt of the strike as they will all fall behind in their education this year. It also means that there are many children whose teachers are on strike who are not coming to school and consequently won’t be able to be a part of the vision screenings. In listening to the principal explain all of this to us this morning, I came to realize that whether Ghana, or the refugee camps in Greece or Costa Rica, or even the United States, we all share the common thread of concern for our children and their well-being and our frustration that more is not being done. It’s universal, regardless of where you reside.
It’s pretty hot in our room at night and I’m struggling with sleep. The roosters are a good alarm clock and I’ve been waking up before 6 and will go out and walk before the heat sets in but the restless nights make for low energy days, which also means I’m headed to bed early.
Yesterday we went to a pottery studio set in a beautiful outdoor setting in a nearby town. The process of using a manual wheel made from old motorcycle parts was fascinating and the end product, which we will pick up after it is fired in the kiln, wasn’t too bad. Today, we’re going to spend some time on a dairy farm and will learn how to make cheese. CCS continues to excel in sharing the culture of other countries through the activities that come after the volunteering. Every day is truly an adventure.
Oh, and if I didn’t mention it yet, we’ve figured out the shower, which is a thin trickle of cold water. It gets the job done, but I can’t imagine washing my hair in the drips of cold water, so it doesn’t look like I will. Hygiene standards are slipping.
I miss the mosquito netting… go figure. The billowy fabric that I tangled myself up in nightly in Ghana, I’m missing. So much so that I woke up in the middle of the night and thought someone had taken it. It took me a few minutes to realize that I’m in Costa Rica, not Ghana. It is hot but not near the heat I experienced in Ghana and I do have the mesmerizing whir of the fan in my face at night like I had in Ghana, so it does feel somewhat “familiar.” I’ll learn to live without the netting, but will have to find a new way to make my bunk my “camp.” Our room is huge and is only occupied by Lynette and me with another volunteer coming from Canada to do the vision screenings with us tomorrow. I’ve stacked and restacked and organized my small pile of belongings until my nest felt like home. This is a very important part of my entry into a new culture and something that I enjoy very much, even though I’m only dealing with a couple of stacks of clothes and a bag of toiletries.
The house is big and our room is huge with 5 bunkbeds and as of tomorrow, will only have 3 of us sleeping in them. The bathroom is almost as big with a large walk in shower that we couldn’t figure out how to get water out of last night, and were shown this morning how it works. I’m guessing it’s the Costa Rican touch as neither of us could get it to work tonite. We will probably need to get this sorted out before too many showerless days get underway. We were forewarned, however, that there is no hot water in the house so showers are cold, as is the water where we hand wash the dishes after every meal. Some things you just can’t think too much about. Our house is a 10 minute drive from the small town of Santa Cruz and is tucked away in a rural setting with a mountain backdrop and cows and horses for neighbors. It really is quite beautiful here.
The coffee is amazing, which was a wonderful surprise for me as it usually has been a disappointment (instant) and more than once while on a volunteer trip, I’ve made the switch to tea because of that. I like it so much that I’m skipping the milk and am drinking it black…something I’ve not done in a very long time.
I’m going to be very happy with the food… simple, basic, good. El gallo pinto, the national dish of beans and rice, has been present at every meal so far (4) as a side, and is the main course at breakfast. I may feel differently after 2 weeks, but right now, I’m happy.
Lush and very green is the best description I can come up with regarding the topography. I’m loving the gentle rains, which I’m told is good as I’ll likely see it every day I’m here. It’s light and intermittent and really very pleasant. My hair doesn’t care for it, but oh well.
We had a 2 hour Spanish lesson this afternoon and it had been a while for me, but I was pleased at how much I remembered and remembered how happy it makes me to conduct conversations in Spanish. I hope I’ll fare as well with the kids, who I’m told will speak little to no English.
Very, very friendly. Our in country manager, Franklin, said that is in part because we are in the country and the people here are more “humble” than in the big cities.
And most importantly, we can brush our teeth with the water directly from the bathroom faucet! But no flushing toilet paper, which isn’t surprising.
Tomorrow we begin our vision screening in a nearby school. I always feel a bit anxious on the first day, hoping I’ll remember how to do the screenings (the computer program specifically) as it looks like Lynette and I will be giving the tutorials on how it’s done to the other volunteers. That first day is always an exciting one. I’ve yet to be disappointed.
I’ve measured time in many ways throughout my life – as a child it was measured in the “untils” as I didn’t have enough “pasts” to really matter……. how many days until my birthday, until summer, until Christmas, until I get new clothes/shoes/stuff and, well you get the picture. As my life started accumulating more pasts, my time markers became milestones….graduating from high school, starting college, quitting college, finishing college, moving, moving back, getting married, having kids, getting divorced and so on. Those are dates that are easy for me to remember because of their significance and dates that everything else seemed to be based around with befores and afters. Lately, say in the last 12 years or so, monumental trips have become markers for me…. Perú, Morocco, Patagonia, Bhutan, Nepal, the Camino, the Camino again and most recently, Ghana. Those experiences help me keep track of life, when looking back, giving it a sense of order. I may not remember all the travel dates exactly, but I do know the order, which makes it pretty easy to extrapolate an approximate date. Not that any of this really matters one bit to anyone but me, and only at the most inopportune times, such as in the middle of the night when I’m trying to piece together a life timeline for no reason other than insomnia, but today it all seems very relevant. One year ago, on this very day, I was given a new marker to the year 2017 – one that I’ll never have to extrapolate with events to remember.
Arlo was born. My daughter became a mama. My son-in-law became a dad. I became a grandma. And all of this happened on MY first born’s birthday. April 30, a date that was etched into my memory – a date that has become a double marker for my timeline of befores and afters.
My friends that came into “grandmahood” before me, had shared stories of a love like no other and told me with such certainty that everything would be forever changed when grandkids entered my life. Of course I had no reason to doubt them, but it was like having someone tell you how incredible seeing the ocean was for the first time. OK, I thought, my first time standing barefoot in the sand with sea spray in my face and water as far as I could see was memorable, but who’s to say what the introduction of a new generation into my family will really bring? I’ve got a confession to all of those who went before me and fell head over heels in love the first time they laid eyes on their grandchild, I get it. You were spot on and all of your predictions and words of love made perfect sense as I held my minutes old grandson for the first time. That understanding has grown each and every day since, 365 to be exact.
A few years ago, my cousin’s daughter was pregnant with her first and had asked the question (possibly rhetorical) of, “Just how long is the umbilical cord anyway?”
I had no answer, simply because I didn’t know, but have thought a lot about that question ever since and have most likely included it on at least one previous Mother’s Day post. So here’s my answer (once again):
It’s as long as it needs to be and will continue to grow as necessary. Mine has extended to Chicago, LA and Ft. Collins, CO. Of course physically it is no longer attached, but energetically, its connection remains strong, and much to my surprise, it has the capability of growing a new grand baby branch. As a Mom and a Grandma, the tethering has continued.
Just one year ago… a very short year I must add, I was doing my own version of the in labor pacing – into and out of just about every retail store in downtown Fort Collins, buying much more than I should have but blaming it on nerves, excitement, and my daughter was in labor for Pete’s sake! I found a miniature version of a stuffed dog that my own first born had been given when he was born (thank you, Aunt Robin) and had loved it clear down to an unrecognizable pile of pieced together patches that was missing both ears and a tail. I bought it. It seemed ominous. It just happened to be the birthday of MY first born child as my baby was in labor with HER first born child.
I had held full composure until that moment….I hadn’t thought of Arlo being born on Thomas’s birthday as OUR shared experience, but rather, had looked at it as her son being born on her brother’s birthday. Our thread of connection, which was already strong, became even stronger than I could have ever imagined. Right then, at that very moment, with her newborn in her arms, she had everything she needed to begin to understand the depths of love that a mom has for her child. As I looked at her, a new mom holding her baby, my love for her expanded so much that I could physically feel it in my chest and I’ve got to think that because of what she was feeling for the first time as a mother to her child, her love for me did the same thing. We were our own versions of the Grinch – hearts exploding with love.
For the past year, and as often as possible as we don’t live in the same state, I’ve watched my grandson grow from the tiny helpless newborn that I didn’t want to let go of, to a walking, communicating, personality-filled one year-old that I also don’t want to let go of. I’m continually in awe and it’s not as if I’ve never seen newborns turn into toddlers, but watching my grandson has been different. I get to roll around on the floor and play and be silly and make funny sounds that I forgot I even could, while leaving the heavy lifting to his Mama and Daddy. I earned this role and I’ve got to say, I’m loving it.
A year seems to go by faster and faster the older I get, and honestly, I never thought I’d type those words as I’ve heard them so often that frankly, I’m bored by them, but it’s true. In the short span of 365 days, I’ve watched a helpless 7 pound, 7 ounce bundle of wonder turn into a walking, climbing, babbling, funny, curious toddler. I’d say that’s a very productive use of time there, Arlo. In comparison, I’ve logged a few more miles and have a few more wrinkles to show for my year. I could have at least upped my Spanish game or learned how to crochet or something. In comparison to your year, I’ve simply laid around. There cannot be any other time in life where so much development and change happens outside of that first year. What a joy to watch from the sidelines while not having to worry about schedules or feedings or planning ahead and bringing everything you MIGHT need in the diaper bag along with the everlasting wonder of will I ever get a good night’s sleep again? I’m here for grandma duty and I’m here to play. Can we wake him up now so we can play with him or can I just go look at him???
I’ve fallen head over heels in love with my one year-old role as grandma (or Laudie as I’m referred to) and am continually amazed by the impact that this little soul has had one my life. Today, while trying to turn on the window unit air conditioner in my rented space in Boulder, it took me a few moments to realize that I was using Arlo’s clunky baby phone (or is it a remote?), which wasn’t getting the air conditioner turned on. Without hesitation or even surprise, I slipped the not an airconditioner remote into my purse, grabbed the correct remote, and turned on the air. Later, while in a coffee shop, I pulled that same toy phone, or whatever it was, out of my purse to answer my phone and wasn’t the least bit embarrassed when I realized that it was Arlo’s pretend phone and not my real phone. Again, I have to emphasize the no embarrassment part. I also had a pacifier and pretend car keys in my purse. I suppose I put them there, but have no recollection. At least I didn’t attempt to start my car with the big primary colored plastic keys. There was a time, many years ago, when volunteering with the elderly in Perú, that I felt I was one Kleenex up the inside of my sleeve away from becoming one of them as I had begun to take on some of their behaviors (forgetting to zip up my pants, hugging and kissing far more than was appropriate and of course always having that tissue tucked up the sleeve, which I rarely used). It’s possible that it is happening again. This time, though, I feel like I’m one call on a Playskool phone call away from becoming a toddler. I’m guessing I’ll be redirected by my daughter if it gets too out of hand.
A few nights ago, while trying to calm down an overly stimulated almost one year-old, I heard my daughter quietly singing the same song that I used to sing to her. You are still my sunshine, Emery, and the sunshine that you and Miles have brought into my life with Arlo, shines brighter than I could have ever imagined.
My two weeks volunteering in Ho, Ghana, was spent doing vision screenings at schools in 2 villages, 30 minutes from our home base. During that time we (5 of us the first week, 4 the second) screened:
I was very pleased with the results, less than 7% failing, compared to our results in the refugee camps in Greece which was close to 20% failure. Those who failed will be seen by an eye doctor in the coming weeks and will be fitted for glasses.
Added to those numbers are the 50 or so school uniforms that we were able to piece back together with buttons, patches and a needle and thread, offering a bit more dignity to the wearer.
I’m very proud of how my time in Ghana was spent and the measurable difference we were able to make simply with a vision screening or a needle and thread. It’s easy to become overwhelmed by the tremendous sense of need when volunteering in developing countries, and although I feel very proud of what I accomplished, I’m also realistic and know that it is only a tiny drop in a vast ocean of need. It hasn’t been that long that Ghana has even been on my radar screen – its needs, its generous spirt, its beautiful children, but the curtain has now been pulled back, the same as it was during my time in the refugee camps in Greece, and I can’t unsee what I’ve seen or unexperience what I’ve experienced. It would be easier on my soul if I could. Hard as it is, I have to keep reminding myself that although it’s only a drop, that drop is a part of something much bigger, and collectively we really can make a difference.
I’m smack dab in the middle of my re-entry process, a process that is never easy for me, but one that I’ve come to embrace as it’s the time in my journey where the memories are still close enough to the surface that I feel like I’m straddling two universes. This is the time when I will wake up in the middle of the night, wondering why the fan is no longer blowing in my face or why I’m not tangling myself up in mosquito netting and why is it not unbearably hot? Without even giving it a thought, the first thing I did when I got home was turn up the heat in my house (despite the pleasant temperatures) and turn on the ceiling fan in my bedroom, which I rarely use. Re-entry. It’s slow for me and although we boarded 3 flights to get home, that soul of mine will hang back for a bit in Ghana, in a hot room with a blowing fan, and will visit me nightly in my dreams with nudges of, “not so fast there, Laurie, this is your absorption time. Don’t rush the process.” The time will eventually come when the suitcase is put away, the laundry done, and my coveted passport tucked away for safe keeping until the next time and life will return to its familiar place. I still have 4 more days of malaria pills to take though, and until that is complete, I still have one foot in Ghana.
I’m amused by how much I miss the things that initially I was so apprehensive about – the heat, oh my word, the heat! And sleeping under mosquito netting with a fan as close as I could get it to my bed, blowing directly into my face. I miss my campsite of a bed, tucking in at 7:30 or so every evening, while reading with a headlamp and eventually being lulled to sleep with the whir of my rotating fan. And my biggest surprise, and for reasons that this heat and humidity hating girl cannot explain, I miss the heat. Go figure. The one thing that I couldn’t stop complaining about my first few days there and now I feel its absence. As a non-sweater by nature, I discovered that a good sweat and frequent brow mops feel pretty darn good, earthy, teenaged-boy odor, and all.
I also miss the food, well most of it anyway. Because I have a gluten sensitivity, and have been advised by my doctor to avoid it, the pancakes and french toast that our cook would make for breakfast were off limits for me. Every morning he made me what looked like a thin omelette with diced red peppers that was rolled up burrito style. I was so pleased the first morning, feeling that my “special” breakfast outshined the pancakes or french toast options. 15 days later, my opinions changed and although I ate it without hesitation, the joy was replaced with nourishment needs. After leaving the home base, fellow volunteer, Lynette, and I spent a few days at a lovely boutique hotel in Accra before heading home. I was so excited to see a beautiful breakfast buffet laid out our first morning there, yet on closer inspection, I realized that, sadly, it was a gluten-laden feast with only one option for me. An omelet. And by choice, I requested red pepper only as my add on. Lynette laughed when she saw my breakfast choice after hearing my morning sighs at my daily, here we go again, omelette.
With the exception of our free time on weekends, my time and my purpose in Ghana was simple – doing vision screenings on the school children with the added bonus of uniform mending. When I wasn’t at the schools, I was immersing myself in the culture of Ghana through dancing and drumming, beading, a lesson in kente cloth weaving, Awe language lessons and even a visit with a witch doctor. My time felt clean and purposeful and held the same kind of amazement that I used to discover in my cultural anthropology classes, only this time they weren’t just stories. They were real and have become my stories that no doubt will be told and re-told for a long time. Stories about the beautiful children – the pure joy in their laughter, their enthusiastic welcomes and the curious hands that would gently touch my arm to see what white skin felt like.
As I process these experiences, during both my waking and sleeping hours, the one thing that continues to give me pause and brings a big smile to my face every time, is the children… the beautiful, sweet, kind children of Ghana. It is their sweet smiles and enthusiastic goodbyes as our van would pull away every day, that I will hold dearly. Those children, who have so little in material possessions but who have an abundance of joy and happiness in their spirits, were there to teach every one of us who worked with them a valuable lesson in what is important. It’s natural for me to come to my own conclusions about their happiness and well-being using my template of experience simply because that’s what I know. Initially, it was the visible scarcity that took my breath away – the small mud brick hovels that hardly seemed livable surrounded by piles of what I can only describe as broken – broken bicycles, tires, car parts and heaps of desk top monitors, or tv’s, I couldn’t tell which. It was an overwhelming entrance into where I would spend the next 2 weeks. When I met the children though, and saw their joy, their happiness and the strong sense of community they shared with one another, their abundance of spirit slowly softened the edges of the poverty that was so overwhelming on my drive in from the airport. I was stunned at how different that drive looked to me 2 weeks later, while I noticed the people in the villages, rather than their surroundings. Once again, time spent in a developing country, has given me the tremendous gift of gratitude for the gifts in my life that are so basic that I hardly see them as gifts… water, a solid shelter from weather and adequate food. Beyond the most basic of needs, our joy and happiness comes from a place within. This is an ongoing struggle for me that I face during my re-entries from developing countries. How do I find my comfortable balance between what I experienced and my own reality? I think it will be the faces of the children of Ghana as they come to mind, that will help me find that place of balance.
The inconveniences of not being able to flush toilet paper, not having hot water or water pressure in the shower, doing my laundry with two buckets rather than a washing machine and forgoing coffee for two weeks (yes, true story on that one…) were just that… inconveniences. Adaptation didn’t take long at all, and I got used to “showering” with a trickle of cool water and skipping the coffee for a cup of tea in the morning. I will say though, that the first cup of coffee and a real shower was pure heaven, something I never would have said a month ago. I no longer need the layer of mosquito deterring deet that I reluctantly applied to my skin every morning, or the fan and mosquito netting that turned my lower bunkbed into my night “camp.” No longer do I need to pay careful attention to the cultural sensitivity of which hand I use, a habit that was very hard to break initially, but one that kept me constantly in check, especially when I would hand items to the children during the testing. Lefty is back on board.
While I make my transition back, the feelings, the emotions, and the moments that tugged at my heart, will remain, with unexpected reminders of who I am, what I’m doing and a clearer picture of my place and my responsibility in the world.
The word Akpe in Awe means thank you and the syllable “ca” has the significance of adding emphasis to the word that precedes it, much like our “very” only with much more of a “more is more” significance. And so with that…
Akpe cacacacacacaca…. (and yes, that many “cas” would be totally acceptable). Your gracious welcoming of me to your country, I will always hold dear.
Before… it’s hard to tell, but these are actually the back of the pair of shorts that I was so distressed by. They also had no zipper so I improvised with some buttons and used holes already there for the buttonholes.
After. Again, no songs of praise for my technique, but at least more shorts and less underwear will show now.
Today our vision screening team of 4 became tailors when an observation of mine on my first day here became a frustration, then an idea, and then a solution, which came to fruition today. One of the first things I noticed about the children whose eyes we were screening, after getting past how adorable they are, was the tattered shape of their uniforms. It was a girl who was holding up the side of her skirt where it had become detached from the bodice and a boy whose seat of his shorts had more underwear exposed than actual shorts and several boys who only had one button on their uniform shirts, leaving most of their chest exposed that I couldn’t stop thinking about once we left the school. With a little bit of effort and a minimal investment in supplies, the solution seemed simple and if in sewing on a few buttons, closing some seams and patching some holes could be a way to restore some dignity to the kids who were wearing uniforms that were long past their prime, then it seemed we should do what we could. I brought up the idea up to Makafui and he was totally on board with it. We had finished the vision screenings yesterday so still had time to bring this idea into a reality. Supplies were purchased, the idea was presented to the headmaster, and our roles from vision screeners to tailors (and I use that word generously) began today.
We had asked the headmaster to tell the children who had uniforms that needed repairs, to bring an extra set of clothes. I’m not sure what we had expected, but were somewhat surprised when we were met by the usual large groups of kids, almost all of them with a 2nd set of clothes in their hands. It was great seeing their enthusiasm but I had to wonder if we had taken on a job far bigger than what we had anticipated.
We had been at another school for the past 4 days doing vision screenings so the children were all very exited to see us, greeting us with smiles and high fives and shouts of “Yayvu, yayvu!” The teachers had the kids line up, the little ones first and we started making assessments. Very few of the 5 and 6 year olds had uniforms that needed any repairs, then we moved onto the older kids (ages 7 to 10 or 12), and that’s when I went into full operation tailoring triage. I’d give each kid a once over with a quick turn around and raising of their arms, then with shouts of “buttons, side seam, situation in the seat” and so on, shirts and dresses were removed and placed into one large heap next to our makeshift work table. There were a few girls (probably no older than 7) who didn’t have other clothes to put on so simply hung around in their underwear. We put a stat on those orders, as running around in only their panties didn’t seem appropriate, although we were the only ones who seemed to care. No one else batted an eye.
Besides being tattered, it also looked as if many of the uniforms, especially the boys shirts, had not been washed, in a very long time. This was not a job for the faint of heart. I was reaching into arm holes and crotches to reattach seams while trying not to think about the actuality of what my needle holding fingers were actually coming into contact with. Thankfully, I had a small container of wipes that offered a bit of relief between jobs, which we made our way through in the first hour. The kids waited patiently, right outside of our open door, never once stepping over the threshold, but spending a lot of time peeking their heads in with giggles and smiles. I’m sure the teachers had told them not to come in as we were busy working and obediently, they didn’t The state of the uniforms were even worse close up as we closed seams, reattached sleeves, sewed on buttons and patched large holes.
We didn’t realize it until we got there that the students and the teachers had begun their 2 or 3 week break from school just the day before, so this was their first day of break. This gave our job even more weight to think that all of the kids had come into school when they didn’t have to, simply to get their uniforms repaired. I felt sorry for the kids that stood in our triage line, clutching onto their extra set of clothes, only to find out that their uniforms needed no repairs. The teachers, who were getting nothing personally out of this, showed only gratitude, rather than annoyance, and thanked us multiple times while assuring us of the importance of our task. It showed the genuine care and affection they have for these kids, which doesn’t always seem obvious then you see the kids getting “caned” by a stick for misbehaving. One teacher told us that the mothers of the students are told to keep their children’s uniforms mended and in repair, but they rarely do. I’m sure repairs to their children’s uniforms are low on their long list of priorities, including survival. I was, however, surprised by the condition of the 2nd set of clothing that the kids had brought – all of them looking clean and very well cared for.
The two tattered uniforms that inspired me to even suggest doing this, happened to fall into my sewing pile. The girl with the skirt that was falling off the bodice and the boy who barely had a seat left in his shorts, hopefully will have a bit more dignity when they put their uniforms after their break and head back to school. We were able to fix all but 2 uniforms because we ran out of time, all of us just hating to leave the 2 untouched. We asked about taking them home then returning them to the school, but the break complicated that idea and the teacher said no, she’d simply hand those uniforms back to the kids. That broke my heart. Hopefully, they were the 2 kids that didn’t care one bit, or at least that’s what I’m telling myself. We repaired 50 some uniforms, leaving them better than when they were brought to us.
I can’t say I’m ready to add tailoring to my list of job skills and am not overly proud of the patch work I did, but it was a quantity vs. quality situation so corners were definitely cut. I am, however, very proud of what we accomplished for the kids today. I’m also proud that what started as an observation that really bothered me, is now a going to be a program that will be implemented with the CCS Ghana program for volunteers as time allows. THAT, along with the smiles on the faces when their repaired uniforms were returned to them, made every needle poke into dirty and smelly fabric, totally worth it.
I got my big welcome to the Ghanaian rain season last night at around midnight. Lightning, thunder, rain and very strong winds. Besides thinking about the laundry on the line that I had forgotten to retrieve before going to bed, I couldn’t help but think about all of the mud block and thatched roof houses we pass on our way into the schools – most likely where our students live. Even in a solid house with windows that can be shut, I was still a bit scared. I want to say that I’ll never, ever complain again about a wet basement or downed limbs after a storm, but sure as I’m typing this, I know I’m lying. I will, however, think about that storm last night the next time I experience a big storm at home and will remember those mud brick houses that we pass every day and hopefully will remember that there are others who have it far worse than I could even begin to imagine.
The road we take to get to the schools was muddy and difficult for our driver to navigate without getting stuck, making our 40 minute drive a lot longer. Even in the muddy conditions, with standing water in the ditches on both sides of the road, we still saw women carefully navigating the mud and the puddles with goods on their heads and flip flops on their feet.
We passed groups of kids along side the road with large metal bowls (like the one I use to do my laundry in) collecting mud. Our driver said they were likely going to use it to fill in the erosion around their houses from the strorm. After seeing that, I wasn’t the least bit surprised to see that many of the kids were absent from school today as they were needed to help their families make the necessary repairs and reinforcements to their homes.
We lost power with the first crack of lightening, which meant we lost our fans. The temperatures had dropped considerably, so the fans weren’t all that necessary, but I have found that I have grown so accustomed to the white noise that once the storm passed, the room felt far too quiet for me. Our room is big and there are only 3 of us occupying it, each of us with our own entire bunk. The white noise of the fan along with my mosquito netting that drapes from the top bunk and is tucked into my mattress, really gives me separation from the others in the room. It feels like a tent to me. We all 3 feel the same way about our tiny spaces, and really look forward to getting in, turning on the fan and tucking in the netting for the night, which is getting earlier and earlier. Tonite I’m tucking in at 7:15 and will write and read until 9 or so. Much earlier and we’re gong to have to ask Joe, our cook, if he could go early bird on the dinners for us! Because I stay up later to read, the lights are usually out around 8:30, at which point my head lamp goes on and the real camping begins. I sometimes forget how emotionally draining this work can be and it takes me more time to recharge my battery so early to bed it is. I’m also up by 5:45 though, so guess tucking in at 9 or 9:30 isn’t all that late.
There was a group of girls cleaning up the storm debris of leaves and branches in the school yard this morning, using brooms that were made of dried grasses. They were working, unsupervised, with such cooperation and focus. Gender roles are very defined in Ghana, with the girls doing the “housekeeping” chores and the boys with the heavy lifting, manual labor chores. What struck me as unique was not only the lack of complaining on the girl’s part regarding the fact that they had to do the chore in the first place, but that they were totally OK with the fact that the boys continued playing while they did all the work. The sense of community is a way of life for the people of Ghana because it’s a necessity. They have to rely on the help of others to survive. I see the cooperation, respect and helping one another already coming into play with even the 5 year olds. There is a lot that Ghana lags behind the United States as a developing country, but I truly think there are lessons we could learn from them in cooperation, humility, respect and kindness. It seems to be a part not only of their education at home, but something that is stressed in the schools as well.
While a group of the older girls were waiting in line for the vision screening (10, 11 and 12 year old range), several began to giggle and point fingers at one another. I had a pretty good idea what it was simply by their gestures and was right. Someone had farted. Kids will be kids will be kids. There are some things that are universal. I loved it even more that it was the girls and not the boys as the girls that age seem so poised and graceful.
As much as I enjoy the younger kids (Kindergarten through grade 2) as they are so affectionate and sweet around us, I have discovered the older girls in the past few days and find them to be absolutely charming. There was a group of 12 to 16 year olds, with one 18 year old, all 6th graders, who wanted to know our names and then in unison, would try pronouncing them. They all told me they thought my name was pretty and actually pronounced it properly with the “au” rather than “o” sound. I then tried to pronounce their names, but with a language that is tonal, I struggled. I tried to explain to them that we simply don’t have the sounds that they do. I showed them photos on my phone of my family and friends and they got so excited with each one, holding their hands over their mouths in amazement. They looked puzzled when I showed the one of my 11 month old grandson and wanted to know what was in his mouth. It was a pacifier. They had no idea what that was. They also got a kick out of Thea’s water bottle that has a button you push to release the lid. They wanted to take turns opening it and passed it from girl to girl to take turns. I was absolutely charmed by them and the affection and kindness they showed one another with a gentle touch on the shoulder or arms linked or even holding hands. It was girls supporting girls in one of the richest forms I’ve ever seen. Their class happened to be mostly girls, unlike most, which seemed to run boy heavy, and I could tell they really liked it that way. I said something about “girl power” to them, which had them all breaking out into cheers and smiles.
This was our last day of testing at this school and we had promised the kindergartners a piece of candy as they were feeling left out as they were too young to conduct the screenings on and had seen that the other children were getting a piece of candy when they completed the test. So we brought candy for them today and passed it out, but were surprised that so many of them weren’t eating it. Come to find out, they didn’t know how to unwrap it. One boy was getting ready to put the whole thing in his mouth, wrapper and all and luckily I got to him in time and was able to get the wrappping off for him. I handed the unwrapped candy back to him and he took it then took off running. And fast! He ran until he was out of sight. Cassy and I looked at one another, not sure what to do, then continued helping the others get the wrappers off the candies. A few moments later, the boy came running back with a piece of sugar cane that was about 2 feet long. I’m guessing he ran home. It was the strangest thing. Did that little piece of candy remind him that he really liked sugar and so he ran home to bring back the real deal? Or did it whet his sugar appetite? The other kids seemed unphased. I was later told that they eat quite a bit of sugar cane, so yes, the candies were a treat, but the sugar itself, not so much. The sugar cane kid, by the way, is one of the skinniest kids I have ever seen and struggles, even with a belt, to keep his shorts pulled up. He’s always got the biggest smile on his face.
A 2 week break for the kids at this school will begin next week. The junior high and high school students are already out for the break as they wrote their exams yesterday and the day before. Today and tomorrow, they all go to their teacher’s farms to help them plant the crops then for the rest of their vacation, they will help their families plant. The teachers are not paid well, but it seems like the free help from the students must be taken into account. I like the idea of the students putting in their own sweat equity in order to help their teachers. I had to wonder what would happen in the school system my children were in if they were not asked, but TOLD they had to help their teacher paint his/her house or help plant their garden or add a new deck to the house instead of heading to the beach. I’m guessing there would be push back.
And finally, the electricity came on just before we left this morning and on the drive over, I realized that although I had posted my last post, I had forgotten to complete what I had started to say about names in Ghanaian culture and then the whole no electricity then no internet happened, but I’m good on all counts now so will finish that explaination and correct my blunder.
The first name a child is given is the day of the week in which they were born. Kofi, as in Kofi Annan, indicates not only that he is male but was born on Friday. Ghanaians have several names and when I ask the kids what their name is, they always will tell you their family name first and then might add their given name, which always grab my attention. Song, Bless, Surprise, Righteous, Forgive and my favorite, Perpetual (a girl, whereas the rest were mostly males) caught my eye today. I love the intention the parents are giving to their children when they bestow them with such hopeful names. I couldn’t help but wonder though, what it would be like to grow up with the name Forgive.
One of my favorite things on a growing list of the eye screenings, is seeing the kids names. Confidence, Promise, Prayer and Bright for the boys and Bless, Delight, Gift for the girls and twin girls named Wonder and Hope. I love the hope that is placed on their children at birth, especially in a country where the infant mortality rate is 35 in every 1,000. Babies aren’t named until a long enough time that they are sure they will survive.
We started working in another school on Friday, about 10 minutes down the road for our first placement. It’s a larger school and has a nice set up with a large treed area in the middle. We arrived Friday to see the junior high kids moving their desks out to that middle section to take their exams. It looked very inviting, also pretty easy to cheat, but I’m guessing the “rod” isn’t spared on the junior high students either. The kids uniforms are even more tattered than the last school with buttons missing, sleeves barely hanging on to the bodice, zippers missing and gaping side seams on dresses. I’m very distressed about this as it seems to be such an unnecessary loss of dignity for these kids to have to endure. I asked Makafui if it would be possible for me to buy new uniforms for the kids (it’s the younger ones that are the worst), but he regretfully said no as it’s not keeping with their sustainability policy. So, I asked if it would be possible for us to bring in needles, thread, patches of fabric and make repairs. He loved the idea and will check with the headmaster. Of course the kids would have to wear something different to school for us to be able to do the repairs.
We were working with the “older” kids Friday (3rd and 4th graders) and I’m so surprised by the range of ages in the grades. I tested one 4th grader who was 16. I also had a few 13 and 14 year olds in that same class. Their age is only a factor of when they were initially sent to school and how many times they’ve been held back. Many of the parents in the areas where we are testing are illiterate and it’s doubtful that they put any kind of a priority on education and because many are farmers, they need the help from their kids. The majority of these kids will likely dropout before high school. You can definitely spot the kids whose parents see education as more of a priority. They are cleaner, have uniforms that are better taken care of and have good English skills, even in the lower grades, such as Kindergarten and first. The headmaster started school a few years late and didn’t end up graduating from high school until he was 23, so older kids in younger grades isn’t a big deal here.
Today while I was waiting for the others to finish up, a crowd of the kids started gathering around (at least 30) so I started asking them simple questions such as favorite colors and how old they were. One of the girls noticed that I had a writing pen hooked onto the edge of my pocked and she wanted to know “why I do that?” I told her, “because it works…”. Then, I’m not sure what came over me, heat, being tired from a bad night’s sleep or simply the fact that they’re kids and kids are fun, but I said “because it works” again, only this time in a sing song manner as I danced to the words. And then it happened. Those 30 some kids broke into song and dance, repeating exactly what I had done. To test my theory, I waved normally, then made a tiny wave with only my index finger. Again, they mimicked my actions to a tee. They are the masters of simon says! It’s possible I’ve started something that I’m likely going to have a lot of fun with in our free time when I’m with them.
One of the girls had an infected open wound on her leg that was dirty and attracting flies. Our driver was kind enough to get some gauze and wrap the wound, which will keep the dirt out, but I think it’s going to take a lot more than that. I’m sure at this point she should be on antibiotics. I’ve actually seen several kids with open and infected wounds, but hers was the worst. Medical care, I’m sure, is hard to come by given the remoteness of their villages. I felt so bad for her as I know it was hurting her because she was limping.
All of the kids in public school are required to shave their heads for health concerns (lice), so it’s rare to see a child under 16 without a shaved head. I’ve got to think it’s a lot cooler as well and certainly easier to take care of.
Many of these kids have never put on glasses before and don’t even know how to put them on their face, which is so surprising to me, but then again,since I’ve been here, I’ve not seen any natives in sun glasses. I think that’s probably one of the reasons the child waiting for the test is so tickeled by seeing their classmate in the test glasses (one pair with the right lens out and the other with the left lens out to test each eye separately).
It was a good day. They keep getting better. And their goodbyes… oh those goodbyes… they touch me every time. Today they ran behind the van, continuing their waving, until almost to the edge of the property!
My weekend getaway with roommates was short and almost 15 hours of it was spent in the car, but we managed to pack in quite a bit during our stay in Cape Coast. After the adrenelin rush at the canopy walk in Kakum National Park, we shifted gears and toured the Cape Coast Castle – a fort built by the Swedes in the 17th Century and later used by the British. When slaves became a valuable commodity for the Americas, the Cape Coast Castle became a holding place for the slaves before shipping off to the Americas and Europe. Changes within the castle were made to accommodate the slaves with the addition of several underground dungeons where they were held awaiting export; a duration that ranged from a few weeks to 3 months.
We were taken through these dungeons as a part of the tour and stood in the exact spots where over 150 to 200 men or women were housed in one of several dungeons. Even in our small group of 20 or so people, it felt very crowded, extremely hot and so stuffy due to the lack of ventilation that it was hard to breathe. At one point, the tour guide shut the lights off for a few moments to to give us a small simulation of what it would have been like to be in total darkness, below ground, in a room full of people. Of course in reality, there would have been 5 or 6 times the number of people and far worse conditions than our brief experience, but just in those few moments, it was terrifying. To accommodate so many people, they literally were stacked on top of one another amid feces, urine, vomit and the decaying bodies of those who didn’t survive. Those who did survive the tortuous conditions, were often partially blinded by the time they made it from the dark dungeon then to the dark ship hold once their eyes were finally exposed due to the prolonged darkness.
My words can’t begin to articulate the impact of this experience had on me – heartbreaking, humbling, horrifying and raw. Many in the group were in tears as they listened to our guide lead us through the horrors that were played out on these innocent victims. The energy within those stone walls of such an injustice against humanity was palpable in the air that hung thick in the dungeonous caverns. It’s an experience that will stay with me for a very long time.
We got back to our hotel around 4:00, had a late lunch and did little else. I felt mentally exhausted and needed to simply absorb the day. We had a small patio with dining tables at the hotel with a half-wall around it, which made for a nice place to have a cup of coffee in the morning or a glass of wine in the evening, although I can’t say I felt totally comfortable in the space. After 2 nights there, I concluded that although our hotel was a nice place to stay, I didn’t want to spend anytime wandering the neighborhood around it. Our hotel was situated at the bottom of a pedestrian bridge, which was crowded with vendors, children quietly trying to get our attention then motioning for money, goats and groups of people gathering. The stark difference between the hotel and just feet outside of its front door, the poverty, was unsettling to me. We were the ones that had the kids pulling on their mom’s skirts to get their attention to point out their curious discovery. If they were old enough to talk, the word, “yayvu,” or white person in Awe, usually followed. We have been reassured by many that this is not said to us with disrespect, but rather as a matter of singling us out, much like you’d do if you saw a rare bird, which I guess we sort of are. It felt uncomfortable, not only being the only white people in the entire area, but that we were sitting in chairs, at a table, eating food, when I had to wonder how many of those who were watching us were hungry. I felt as if we were on display.
Our drive back went a lot faster as we didn’t hit the traffic we hit on Friday night, which meant we encountered far fewer vendors and only in a couple of spots. They had upped their game though and to the list of goods that were being sold, I saw a lot of new items, such as bike intertubes, toilet bowl cleaner, dish towels, flip flops, first aid kits, oh and chickens…live. Of course all of these goods were carried atop heads as they wove their way in and out of the stopped cars. At least it was daylight and not dark, which seemed totally unsafe to me.
I saw several posters as we passed through small towns that would have a person’s picture on it and would have the words, “Call to Glory” below the photo. I’ve got to think that this was an obituary of sorts, although there was no other information, except for the age.
This is a very religious country with a strong Pentecostal following. About every other billboard, it seemed, was advertising a church – mega churches, the “hot” church (no idea), the church of many miracles and so on. What surprised me the most though was not necessarily the advertising, but rather that the picture was always of the minister, which looked like he was the one being advertised, rather than the church, in full celebrity fashion. I found them fascinating, for that reason, and started taking photos of them. I think my roommates think I’m strange.
We made a stop midway for a bathroom break and to pick up a few things. On our way out, there was no bathroom break, but rather, our driver pulled over, behind a bus, and asked if we needed to go. Granted, we would have had the bus for privacy, but the bus had stopped and was unloading it’s passengers for the same purpose. No, thanks. We’re good, at which point legs got crossed until our arrival a few hours later. We appreciated the gesture though, and a few miles later, he pulled off again and told us that he needed to “go use himself.” His English wasn’t very good. He may want to work on that phrase a bit more before using it on passengers.
We only had one checkpoint, vs the many checkpoints on the way out and our driver told us that it was because people don’t rob during the day. I’m grateful now for the inconvenience of those stops, in the dark, on Friday evening.
It was a powerful weekend in many ways but it felt very good to be “home.” Lynette, my traveling buddy who was detained in Atlanta due to illness, is finally here. It’s was so good to see her and I’m anxious for her to get to meet the charming kids tomorrow. 2 volunteers left on Saturday, so our group is only 4 now.
Today was a good, productive day… we did vision screening for 45 kids and not a one of them failed. Failure rate is around 20% and we were far below that. I’m guessing that when we get into the older grades, we will see more failures, but so far, this is very good news!
The kids school uniforms are all different and very tattered, which I’m guessing is because they are the cast offs from a variety of other schools. Although there may be large holes in them or gaping fronts due to all but one of the buttons missing, the sleeves still are ironed with a crease and they all seemed to be clean. Oh what I could have done with a needle and thread today! One of the girls was literally holding her skirt up as she was having her height and weight checked because about 1/3 of the seam that connected the skirt to the bodice was ripped. The boys shirts are always tucked in and their shorts belted, most with belts that look like they could wrap around their small bodies twice. All are in shoes that are quite worn, mostly sandals and 2, a boy and a girl, were in slippers. One little boy was barefoot. Even though their uniforms are quite worn and ill-fitting, there still seems to be a lot of pride taken in the children’s appearances.
Because I was doing the height and weights today, I had a lot more time with the kids while they waited to have their vision screened. Most are quite small, the average weight being around 20 kilograms for the girls (or around 40 pounds), which is considered underweight for girls their age, making the age guessing quite difficult. One very small girl that I guessed to be no more than 6, was 10. Assumptions of their age due to the grade they are in are also not accurate as the grade one class had an age range from 6 to 10. It simply depends on the age the parents start sending their children to school. Most of the children knew how old they were, but very few could tell us their birthday, so I’m guessing it’s not a day that is widely celebrated.
I’m still absolutely amazed by their discipline and respect these children show, as they waited in line, single file for quiet some time this morning. The teacher wasn’t even present, yet they still kept their hands to themselves. I’ve heard from several Ghanaians that family values are a top priority in Ghana and it sure is reflected in their children. I noticed that when I gave the girls a post it note with their name and birthdate on it to be given to the vision screeners, they alway did a small curtesy when they accepted it from me. I didn’t see this with the boys, but without fail, every girl genuflected when she accepted the piece of paper from me. It was sweet.
Along with the more traditional names such as John, Andy, Jennifer and Esther, I enjoyed seeing multiple Princesses, a Courage, 2 Godsways and an Elvis. Of course their pronunciations, quite different than mine, only added to the interest. I learned many body parts from the girls while they waited in line and as I’d pronounce the word back to them for nose, or ear or eyes in Awe, seriously thinking I was mimicking their sounds perfectly, they would glance over at one another and cover their mouths, trying to hide their giggles. The only word I can remember and seem to be spot on with my pronunciation, is “baba”, or “sorry” so I apologize a lot to them. I need to find some more words. I do know that when you add “cacacaca” to a word, it means “very much”… so the more ca’s the better. I like that.
Our drive into the school is 30 minutes in a rickety old van on rutted dirt roads and we all feel pretty exhausted once we get home. Today, after lunch, we drove two more hours, but this time to Wle Waterfall, hours, about half and half on paved roads and dirt roads. It’s the tallest waterfall in Ghana and the 2nd tallest in Western Africa. It was incredible and the hour and a half or so of hiking to get to it felt good, even though it was quite a brow mopper with the humidity today. Temps, however, have come down a bit, thankfully.
Goats and chickens seem to be the cats and dogs of Ghana. They are everywhere. The goats are quite small (Pygmy?) and run around like dogs, although I’ve only seen one dog since I arrived and 2 kittens. The goats have the run of the place. They don’t seem to be raised for their milk as this seems to be pretty much a dairy-free area (oh coffee-free also it appears…just instant and it’s bad, so my 2 a day, with milk, has been replaced by a one a day with tea. Sigh.). I’ve not seen a meat I couldn’t identify at mealtime, so don’t think we’re eating the goats either. I’m good with just looking at them. They sure are cute.

Whatever the case may be,...<br /><a class="read-more-button" href="http://jacksonvillejaguarsvshoustontexans.us/a-good-lawyer-can-help-you-with-legal-issues/">Read more</a>
Some matters and situations in life just dictate that you have to use a lawyer. It can be as simple as a single legal document you need advice on, or full blown representation in court. Whatever the case may be, no pun intended, you may not be familiar with dealing with lawyers. Read on to learn a few things.
Remember that you should be the one seeking out a lawyer, not the other way around. This is likely to be some sort of scam, particularly if you are dealing with an expensive issue. Only hire a lawyer that you want.
You have a right to expect clear, consistent communication with your lawyer. He or she should be able to give you a general summery of what you can expect in terms of your case, as well as what potential issues might arise and what could be done to remedy these issues.
Use Google to your advantage when it comes to hiring a lawyer. Look for reviews about any attorney you are considering. If the general consensus is that the attorney you are interested in is lazy and incompetent, you should do your best to look for another attorney to handle your case.
Make a log of each interaction that you make with a lawyer. Write down the date and time as well as the topics you discussed. Do not hesitate to ask how much you owe so far. This can help eliminate any problems that can arise later.
Don’t give your lawyer an enormous retainer up front. If your lawyer needs a retainer for your case, then you should ensure any money that isn’t used will be refunded back to you. You need to think about asking around because some lawyers will take smaller retainers and will later charge you whatever else they need.
If you have been charged with a crime, are in an accident or think you need legal help, you need to hire a lawyer. The amount of time that you wait to make this decision can be a critical factor. You want to have someone on your side that knows the law as quickly as possible.
There are online services you can use to find good local lawyers but do not assume that these online services do a good job of screening the lawyers they recommend. You should do some background research on the different lawyers you see listed online and meet with them to discuss your issue before hiring them.
Make sure that you are one hundred percent comfortable before you sign any legal documentation hiring your lawyer. The last thing that you need if you are already in a bad situation is to have to pay extra money to a lawyer that you do not want. Take precaution before signing on the dotted line.
If you find a divorce lawyer and they seem very excited about making your ex “pay” for everything they have done to you, look for someone else. While you may have revenge in your heart, your lawyer is supposed to think straight at all times. Being biased is not a good work ethic, even if it is in your favor.
Talk to friends and family. Word of mouth is one of the best ways to find a lawyer. You get first hand information from someone who has been through the legal process with your potential attorney. Even if your friends or family have had a bad experience, that information is valuable so you don’t make the same mistake.
Lawyers are sometimes a necessity in life. You might have to consult one for just a few minutes or have one stand beside you in court for days on end. Regardless of your situation, you need to know a few tips and tricks about finding a good one and dealing with them. Hopefully, this article has done just that for you.

So there's this ongoing debate about whether or not you should include promotional packaging like fliers, postcards, slick dvd packaging with your festival application to improve your chances. Many festivals actually explicitly say that "your submission will be judged on the quality of your film, not your marketing materials," meaning don't try to butter them up with cool packaging!
But then there are some directors, whose films have done well at festivals, that swear by the exact opposite saying that including that marketing material helped their film do so well. Still others have gone so far as to claim that it actually will hurt your chances as screeners get annoyed. (Remember that Calvin and Hobbes cartoon where Calvin thought he'd get at least a B+ on his book report because he had a shiney plastic cover for his paper? OK- I'm old).
so i don't know which one is true but so far, my submissions have been plain DVDs bought from Office Depot with the film's name/info written neatly with a black Sharpie pen. The rest of the application content is whatever Withoutabox.com sends in for me electronically (they cover all the required content like film synopsis, actor/director bios, etc). I think the film's done well considering and the only thing I think I've done wrong (and have stopped doing) is submitting my film on or close to the deadline dates.
I thought I'd bring this up because people have been debating it a lot on the boards and people have strong, "proven" opinions about their application strategies. For me, it'll probably still be DVDs and a Sharpie mainly because I don't want to swallow the cost of a nicely burned and packaged DVD that only screeners will ever see...maybe a postcard tho ;)
great discussion! i think you may be right especially about how it could even backfire if your production quality of the film is nowhere near as good as the packaging (kinda like p0rn).
last november i went to a panel at afm entitled 'everything you want to know about film festivals.' i blogged about it here: afm + film festivals.
the advice given about packaging was: don't bother with the trappings. specifically matt dentler of sxsw said all he wants to do is go home, open up a package, pull out a one-off dvd, put it in the dvd player and sit back and hopefully enjoy a good film. any care packages are ignored and given to the volunteers.
here's about all that fancy packaging will get you: my friend was one of the three judges this year for the comiccon film festival (which is actually going on the same weekend as the action on film festival). he said that he received a package of about 10 dvds at a time to review. the ones with cool packaging and a nice looking cover usually got looked at first.
but that was it. apparently that packaging rarely if ever corresponded to a film being good or memorable - and in the end he had to watch all 10, comment on and rate them and then send them back for 10 more. so ultimately it has no impact.
in fact, given the above, one could argue that if you create an impression on the reviewer with your artwork and then don't live up to that, it'll work against you. better to let them form their own opinions simply from the movie itself.
it seems obvious, but it's just that I know other directors who have won their divisions and they are so positive that it's the way to go to send in cool packaging and stuff... oh well i'm just more comfortable with my own way...

Scientists at the National Institute for Health Research Manchester Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) have discovered a new link between a rare childhood disorder and a common immune system disease.
Over the last 10 years Professor Yanick Crow and an international team of colleagues have studied the inflammatory brain disease Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS). Some children with AGS also develop an early-onset form of the autoimmune disorder systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
The researchers previously discovered that mutations in four genes caused AGS. These genes provide the instructions for making nucleases, a type of protein which cleans up 'waste' nucleic acids produced during the normal life-cycle of our cells. A failure of this clean-up process causes waste DNA and other material to accumulate in cells. The immune system then mistakes this material as 'foreign' and attacks it.
Explained Professor Crow: "We have now identified mutations in a fifth gene, accounting for approximately 20% of AGS cases. This result is important because it will allow for confirmatory genetic testing in children with suspected AGS, and the opportunity of genetic testing during pregnancy for affected families. Additionally, our data adds a previously unknown component to the puzzle of how the innate immune response is triggered in AGS and lupus.
"Further studies of this gene will increase our understanding of the precise mechanisms involved in causing AGS and SLE, and thus allow us to develop precisely targeted therapies for these devastating disorders. This is work that is ongoing in our BRC-supported laboratory."
The importance of the discovery linking the causes of AGS and SLE has led to the team's findings being published in the leading international magazine "Nature Genetics". Around 300 families have been involved in the research project over ten years. At least ten new cases of AGS are diagnosed in the UK each year. Some cases are very severe, with around 40 percent of children dying from the disease before the age of ten, but others are much more mildly affected. More information on Aicardi-Goutières syndrome is available on the gene reviews website

Delayed transfers of care are one of the key issues facing hospitals: known more commonly as bed blocking, they result in patients being stuck in hospital because there is nowhere else for them to go. Housing associations are skilled in both asset development and management, which means they are well placed to increase the supply of high quality step-down housing, whether temporary or long-term.
In addition, housing associations can not only provide step-down housing, they can also deliver, for example, discharge services for people tailored for specific vulnerable groups, or for older people. Discharge services can include, for example, advice on tenancy sustainment, signposting to local health or community services, as well as other specialist support services.
Housing-based solutions have proved to be more cost efficient for the NHS, often delivered at a third of the price of equivalent in-patient care. Consequently, NHS England is beginning to see the financial value of working with housing providers, as well as the value for money their services provide. It has incorporated housing into new pilots for new community forensic services, as well as involving housing in order to address the high costs of out-of-area placements in mental health.
Another partnership HACT has helped the sector to develop – and which we’ll be celebrating and discussing at a roundtable on sport and housing in July – is how housing can help to build resilience and wellbeing through community initiatives. Housing associations have run numerous partnerships with community and specialist organisations, corporate supporters, and funding trusts, delivering programmes around healthy eating, sports and physical activity, mental wellbeing, and health promotion.
Indeed, every year, housing associations invest around £750million in communities: aligning this investment with NHS and public health priorities could have significant long-term benefits, not only on health and wellbeing, but also on future NHS spending. The trick is in ensuring that people within the health sector get to hear about what you’re doing: this means investing in your communications capacity.
Like the NHS, housing associations are working with more vulnerable people, and with more people over the age of 50. As well as providing specialist support, they are investing in social prescribing, mental health support and programmes that identify and tackle the growing crisis of isolation.
With their unique relationships with their residents, and their reach into local communities, housing associations are ideally placed to support the NHS to develop, model and test new pathways of care. Demonstrating the value of those pathways, and how to broker that relationship, will be the focus for the fourth and final part of this blog series.

Kundalini Yoga Therapy Training with Guru Dharam & Faculty - Module 3 - The Twisted Hair South London 22-27 November 2018 is now FULLY SUBSCRIBED as is the waiting list in case of any cancellations.
Cover your Crown with a choice of hairbands, tubes or hats. All made with love by Martina who models the headwear.
The October 2018 intake for our respected Kundalini Yoga Instructor Training was fully subscribed; consequently our January 2019 intake will be limited to 16 places - half of which are already taken. Don#t delay, enquire today - places are allocated in order of receipt of application and payment. See www.i-sky.net/events for booking details
Thanks to i-SKY I have been able to experience a never-ending neutral love. There is nothing better in my experience. During training old patterns fell away and we all blossomed. I have been able to see myself honestly and embrace all of me. Relationships, perspectives, energy, all improved. At the end of training I glowed, attracting all that was right for me. I was filled with trust in the world. It is more than visionary to establish such a school. It is courageous and committed. Darryl,The Livtar's Guru Dharam, Benjahmin (and other students) are the conduits that bring the tool box that is Kundalini Yoga. Whatever ails- there is something in the tool box to help. Its strong enough to sustain you way after the training ends, if you allow it. I had no idea what was coming next- without this training, and its ability to heal, I would not have survived what did. I am forever grateful. I-sky are there if I email. Darryl reminds me to Keep Up. They are fortification of joy, grit, growth accompanying me in spirit, called upon whenever I need. Its massive. Students continue to grow me- bringing me dark gifts such as stress, broken hearts, mitochondrial sickness, ovarian cancer, thyroid, interview nerves; they name it, and we work on it together. And all the while behind this ongoing practise, behind I-sky's invaluable school, are Yogi Bhajan's teachings. He is - in my minds eye- as he was the day my training ended. I was snivelling into my tissue. . I had felt suddenly afraid - that the love would end with my training. He was belly laughing at me "Its just beginning ..." he roared. I have kept the tissue. He has kept his word. Love is the word. xx
Where would I be without my level 1 KY training with Darryl and Guru Dharam, both of whom knew I was going to be a healer before it had even occurred to me! Happy birthday SKY. You led me quietly through the course without judgement or criticism. A great preparation for the much tougher level 2. I will always be grateful to you both for setting me on this beautiful path.
I was so happy to reconnect with Darryl and Elena ten years after my level 1, and to share these two very special evenings with so many totally radiant, fun, open and loving people. I couldn't imagine a more perfect place to see in a New Year. Thank you, to everyone who made it happen, from the bottom of my heart <3 I wish I didn't live so far away….
The Dawn of Defiance campaign is a series of 10 downloadable adventures using the Saga Edition rules. Originally published on the Wizards of the Coast Star Wars RPG website, the adventures can be played individually, but when played in order, they form a complete campaign with a story arc that takes players from 1st level to 20th level. These adventures were made available for free, and are collected here for archival purposes. ...

Just a quick update to let everyone know that we have opened a forum on the Holonet for discussion of the Fantasy Flight Games' Star Wars RPG, including the Edge of the Empire game (currently in beta as of this writing). You can find the forum here. ...
Where to start….the first substantial section in this book is a great section on generating a three dimensional character. It has detailed sections on homeworlds for characters, suggestions for a character’s life as they grew up, past occupations, romance, and much more! This is a wonderful addition for gamemasters who have the chronic player problem of “bland characters”. If you utilize this section even to half of its potential, you’ll get your money’s worth out of this book. ...
Alright, let’s take a look at this book. It’s got information all over the place! Adventure ideas, non-player character stats, vehicle information, starship information, templates to make characters, alien information…..I could go on and on! ...
This is a nice book. I’ve got it in both 1st and Second edition. In my opinion, the Second edition variety is superior. This book is one of those very helpful types if you know little-to-nothing about Star Wars. From information about the commonly used items of sublight drives, turbolasers, shields, and weapons, all the way up to some Capital ship stats. There are a lot of stats for fighters in here, and a fair number of airspeeders, speeder bikes & swoops, and even creatures. ...
Just a quick note, we have reopened the registration system fully following our upgrades this year. This is going to be a trial to see if our anti-spambot mechanisms are working, but for now there will no longer be a waiting period for user validation. So, if you've been looking to sign up for the site, now is the time to do so! ...

The Institute of Productivity (IoP) has spent many years working on the creation of effective and efficient international food supply chains- working in the Caribbean, Africa, Asia and Europe. Our experience in developing countries has led us to conclude that:
· traditional supply chains built on poor control give poor product quality; this results in poor returns and keeps people poor
· standard approaches to addressing this problem via the imposition of sophisticated quality standards are ineffective when the primary agents in the supply chain (farmers, growers, fishermen, etc.) often fail to grasp the WHY of standards, let along the HOW.
This problem is becoming ever more important as the world faces significant problems of food supply and security due to:
An understanding of these issues has led IoP to review and revise its approach to supply chain development, resulting in an approach designed to:
· view the issue through a ‘productivity lens’ to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of food supply chains are considered
· change the ‘mind set’ of the key actors in ways which create a self-directed desire and momentum for change.
· provide support and skills which create long-term, sustainable change and resilient supply chains.
Aid projects which claim to be ‘pro-poor’ are often based on the premise that it is always possible to get a higher price for product meeting a relevant standard . Due to the differences in ‘power’ and negotiating strength of suppliers and international buyers, this is not always the case. Approaches based on productivity development – by design – are focused on producing more product for the same resource inputs. This is both effective and intuitive – using fewer inputs quickly convinces farmers and other supply chain actors of the benefits of new ways of working. Since measurement is built in to the approach as a key feature, benefits can be demonstrated and evaluated, reinforcing the key message for all concerned – the farmers themselves, support agencies, government agencies, aid agencies, etc.
Identify key stakeholders (normally Government, industry, buyers and NGO’s but especially those with ownership of key resources and decision-making power. Identify the expectations and aspirations of these key stakeholders?
Identify the skills landscape - what is the current knowledge and skillset that relates to food supply, food standards, etc.
Identify any relevant history – approaches/aid projects that have been tried in the past. What has ‘failed’? or worked well and why?
Identify ‘readiness for change’. What is the level of dissatisfaction with the current situation/performance? Is there a vision of the future?
Review the standards that currently apply to the area of work and understand which elements may confer benefit to the local actors (farmers, fishermen).
Create a ‘tailored’ code of practice covering ‘key controls’ which can achieve most of the benefits of reaching the full standard but can be applied at the current state of readiness. It is very important to use language (and local language) appropriate to the actors … so, for example, wherever possible one should use pictures/graphics for illiterate and semi-literate actors.
Undertake a baseline survey of existing performance against the key controls – this is ‘comparative benchmarking’ & identification of good performance. It is generally easier to motivate unsophisticated actors to improved performance if they know where they stand in performance terms compared to the best of their peer group (“If they can do it, so can I.”)
From the benchmarking, identify knowledge/skills required to accelerate the adoption of the code of practice/key controls.
Identify groups or individuals that can act as ‘change agents/catalysts’ – these may be from existing support groups or from within the community of actors itself. This stage helps provides the necessary scale of operation.
This group need to fully understand proven benefits of any programme and associated performance measures demonstrating positive change for the farmer and buyer.
Create, prepare and deliver training to the change agents – who will represent the top of a hierarchy of support workers. This training should include the vision (of improved performance), the standard which represents the final goal, the code of practice which represents the intermediate, feasible goal alongside communication/training/mentoring skills. It is preferable to use accredited training that leads to recognition of the change agents – this acts as a motivator/reward.
Identify any technology support that might act as a catalyst to the introduction of the code of practice/key controls. (e.g. a SMS-based information service on weather forecasts, pest information, etc).
Work with the change agents to prepare a cascade of training that will eventually reach all actors (farmers, growers, fishermen) in the target community. This cascade might be organised geographically, in naturally-occurring or existing clusters or around specific sub-sectors (such as different crops).
The change agents have knowledge of the proven benefits of intervention and the key productivity and performance indicators which farmers can track.
Plan change interventions designed to improve compliance with the key controls in some target farms as part of the cascade process.
Re-benchmark at least a sample of farms – both farms which have had interventions and some which have not (as a control set. Presumably these ‘control farms’ have been subject to a similar environmental changes – pests, weather, etc.). This benchmarking should be done at regular intervals to establish a longitudinal data set
Work with the change agents and existing support agencies on ‘project afterlife’ – how will change be maintained and performance improved once the specific project has been completed.
Plan and prepare information sheets, leaflets and (revised) training materials to reflect the impact study and support this afterlife.
Consider the establishment of a ‘Skills centre’ to work with change agents - probably using an existing agency to avoid ’politics’. This skills centre will hold the benchmark data, coordinate the cascade of training, `and coordinate any technology support and service,
Provide impact packs to skills centre so that they understand the interventions that have had the greatest impact – and how those interventions have been handled.
It’s common for people who have consumer debts such as credit cards and medical bills to be sued and have judgments entered against them prior to filing bankruptcy. The first thing to realize is this is all very normal. In fact, lawsuits are so common that the threat of wage garnishment stemming from a judgment is one of the leading motivations for people to file bankruptcy sooner rather than later.
The second thing to realize if you have been sued is that lawsuits move fast and your money and earnings are at risk. In Minnesota, lawsuits are generally initiated when the plaintiff serves the defendant with a summons and complaint stating the basis for the lawsuit and amount owed. For lawsuits involving the collection of debt such as credit cards, the complaint typically will set forth the outstanding balance owed as well as tack on accrued interest and attorney fees. From the date that a summons and complaint are served, the defendant has 20 days to submit an answer or the plaintiff can quickly ask the court for a default judgment. Once a judgment is entered, the creditor is now a judgment creditor” and has additional remedies available to collect on the amount owed, including garnishment of wages and levying any bank account that is linked to the “judgment debtor”.
the lawsuit is still pending at the time the bankruptcy is filed, a judgment cannot be entered. However if the lawsuit has already been reduced to a judgment, the judgment can still be discharged by bankruptcy. In some circumstances money that has been garnished from wages or levied from a bank account prior to the bankruptcy can be returned to you. There is a process to remove judgments post-bankruptcy discharge, which is advisable to help restore credit quicker after bankruptcy.
If you have been served with a lawsuit, you may wish to act fast to consult your bankruptcy options within the first couple weeks. While it’s generally best to head off a lawsuit before it gets to the point of judgment, you still have options even after a judgment is entered. A bankruptcy attorney can clearly explain what you can expect as far as the lawsuit, judgment and the return of any garnished or levied funds are concerned. Just remember that the legal process moves quickly and prevention is the best defense.

Engaging Families in High School Success (EFIHS) is a collaborative initiative of Seattle Public Schools and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), funded by the U.S. Department of Education. It focuses on the impact of 8th and 9th grade family engagement on increased student attendance and course passing rates – important predictors of on-time student graduation and college enrollment.
Seattle high schools and middle schools are working to implement 8th and 9th grade transition-related family events and activities to engage all families. These activities are reflected on and improved through coaching and inquiry for continuous improvement.
Scores of national studies consistently point to the importance of 9th grade as a pivotal year in a student’s high school trajectory. Intentional family engagement activities by secondary schools have shown to increase parental efforts in supporting student learning, modeling learning behaviors, and reinforcing the importance of schoolwork and success in school.
Parental support of secondary student learning from home has also been linked to students’ perceptions of themselves as learners, increased motivation to do their best in school, and graduate.
Seattle secondary schools participating in the EFIHS initiative receive training, coaching, assistance to develop family engagement activities, materials and a small grant. Participating schools are:
The EFIHS initiative contributes to improved school-family partnerships in secondary education and will develop a set of evidence-based model practices for schools nationwide.
On December 8, 2018, this annual trip is a favorite for hard-core WAS members. Because access to the landfill is restricted, we rent vans for the trip and have to limit the number of participants. First priority goes to Washtenaw Audubon members who have not recently been on this trip. Second priority will be given to Washtenaw Audubon members who have previously attended this trip. Non-members may be placed on a wait list on a first come, first served basis and will be admitted three days before the trip to fill any remaining spots. There are 22 spots available.
Due to the high cost of renting and fueling large passenger vans, we are asking for a minimum donation of $5 from each participant. This is not required, but will help us offset some of the costs and allow us to continue to provide this trip into the future. Please give your donation to the trip leader on the day of the trip.
Meet at 8:30 a.m. at the far south end of the Park-n-Ride lot at Plymouth Road and US 23. Please do not be late! We want to be in the vans and driving by 8:45. This trip will take about 4 hours. Please note that the weather for this outing can be extremely cold and that there is usually wind on the heights of the landfill, where participants will be spending most of the time. Dress warmly! (This means dress for temperatures at least ten degrees colder than your morning thermometer reading. This is not an active trip where you will be generating heat through movement.)
Non-members may be placed on a first come, first served wait list, and will be able to go on the trip only if it does not fill up with members.

Can the international trade system be a catalyst for reforming fossil fuel subsidies (FFSs) to help relieve the burden on the public purse, reduce local and global air pollution, improve energy security and tackle climate change?
This was the theme of a recent workshop set at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva and organized by Climate Strategies, the Stockholm Environment Institute and the International Institute for Sustainable Development. The event forms part of a broader conversation on how the international trading system can be made compatible with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.
Participants found there is significant scope for the WTO and international trade agreements to complement and strengthen reform efforts already being supported under a range of international forums, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the G20 and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.
Owing to its wide membership, its central role in disciplining trade-distorting subsidies across economic sectors and its well-established dispute settlement system, the WTO is well equipped to take the FFS reform agenda forward.
To date, however, the WTO’s involvement in FFS has been limited. In notable contrast with the various disputes against renewable energy subsidies that have been launched at the WTO over the past decade, no FFSs have been disputed thus far. In part, this is because many WTO Members do not fully notify on their FFSs, whether because of a lack of data and understanding of energy subsidies and their trade effects, current shortfalls in the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures’ (ASCM) notification questionnaire or a lack of mechanisms to enforce notification. In the absence of case law and targeted research, there is also a lack of legal clarity on the extent to which different types of FFSs can be disciplined by the ASCM to begin with.
And yet addressing this topic falls squarely within the WTO’s mandate. FFSs can have a range of distorting impacts on trade and investment, including by affecting the rate and timing of development of new fields or mines.
Moreover, the WTO was established with a view to ensuring economic progress is achieved in accordance with the objective of sustainable development, and the SDGs explicitly identify trade as a critically important means of implementation. As such, trade should be viewed as an enabler for achieving the SDGs and targets, including the objective of reducing FFSs set out under SDG 12.
Although parallels should not be overstated, it is also worth noting the WTO’s continued engagement on reducing environmentally harmful fisheries subsidies as part of the Doha Round. Observing the discrepancy in how the two subsidies were treated in the WTO, the former Director-General Pascal Lamy characterized the absence of FFS from the WTO’s agenda as a “missed opportunity.”
During the Geneva workshop, participants identified multiple avenues to address FFSs within the international trading system. While not purporting to be exhaustive, the table below identifies five key categories of action available to WTO Members: 1) promoting capacity building and technical cooperation; 2) enhancing transparency; 3) adopting subsidy reform pledges and ensuring credible follow-up through reporting and review; 4) clarifying the interpretation of existing rules; and 5) making changes to existing rules. Several concrete pathways to help realize these goals are also identified.
It is important to note that these pathways are not mutually exclusive, and many are likely to be particularly effective if adopted together. A pledge, report and review system, for instance, would benefit from parallel efforts to improve transparency.
All approaches would necessarily be led by WTO Members. They range from those that are purely voluntary to those that are binding and embedded in the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism. This provides scope for gradual enhancements of ambition.
In a similar vein, many approaches can either be taken forward plurilaterally (by a coalition of the willing) or multilaterally (involving all WTO Members). As illustrated by references to fossil fuel subsidy reduction in the EU-Singapore Free-Trade Agreement (which is awaiting formal approval), bilateral and regional trade agreements may form an effective platform to pioneer cooperative approaches to FFS reform.
The workshop also made clear that any successful effort to address FFSs through the international trade system will need to adequately address the special circumstances of developing countries. That might involve special and differential treatment provisions, including potential exemptions and carve-outs for development, energy access and other reasons.
With the WTO’s 11th biennial Ministerial Conference coming up in Buenos Aires in December 2017, creative thinking, constructive debate and further research on the various options on the table are needed to help ensure the promise of Paris and the SDGs is fulfilled.

Since u varies from 0 to h in the rarefaction wave, decay of the height of the top hat is given by max u = he−λt . 18) where we have inserted the 1C xF = 0 at t = 0. 19) which, on integration and use of 1C xs = X at t = 0, gives xs = X + hα (1 − e−λαt ). 20) gives the shock trajectory. 21) yielding t0 = − 1 (α + 1)λX ln 1 − . 22) Thus, the rarefaction wave catches up with the shock only if 1− (α + 1)λX > 0, hα that is, 1 h > [(α + 1)λX] α . 22). Suppose a characteristic in the rarefaction has a value u = c at time t.
2) where h, α and β are positive constants; λ > 0 is the dissipative constant. If α = 0, the solution is a decaying travelling wave moving to the right with speed 1. 3) dx du = 0 along the characteristic curves = uα . 4) and so dx = uα which are straight dt lines in the (x, t) plane. The initial condition u = 0 for x < 0 and u = h for x > 0 give rise to a rarefaction wave centred at x = 0. All values from 0 to h propagate along the characteristics of the rarefaction wave. Since α > 0, dx the characteristic with value h for u has the highest speed: = hα .
Thank you friends and readers for nominating La Vitamina T for the Yolotmetztli Award granted by the Binational Institute of Human Development. I feel incredibly honored and absolutely privileged to be recognized for doing what I love most: creating awareness for one of Mexico’s most delicious and fascinating treasures, its food.
The more I talk about food, the more I find it a particularly powerful element of national identity. Food gives us a common ground (we eat, therefore we exist), and while food makes us different, it also makes us the same.
Perhaps through this interactive art form, we can find understanding and love for the people who bring it to life.

With the untethered jailbreak now available to iOS 5 users, Cydia enthusiasts will now be frantically clogging their devices with various tweaks from Saurik’s App Store alternative.
As most of you will be more than aware, much of the content found in Cydia – as is the case with its Cupertino cousin – is junk, and thus we try our level best to filter out much of the garbage and point you guys towards the tweaks worth your time and money.
Before the days of smartphones, e-mail and SMS were two rather different mediums of communication – one was done on a mobile device – the other predominantly on a PC or Mac. In our digital age, however, the pair work harmoniously, crossing over each other and providing one synonymous, multi-platform service.
iMessage is a prime example of this, allowing text and rich content to be sent back and forth between iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices whether using a phone number or e-mail address.
iForward, a jailbreak tweak developed by Ryan Conigliaro, essentially bridges the remaining gap between e-mail and SMS by allowing text messages to be forwarded to a corresponding e-mail address without any hassle whatsoever. It willfully forwards sent and received messages along with all the relevant
sender/recipient information and even notifies of any incoming or outgoing calls. Even voicemails get in on the act with the latest update, with an audio file being sent as an attachment directly into that designated e-mail inbox.
There are two key reasons why iForward could be an invaluable tool in your quest to stay connected. Firstly, in that morning rush, if you forget (God forbid) to pick up your iPhone on the way to work/school/college, you can – if only partially – keep in touch with those seeking your conversation. More importantly, you can also keep tabs on your device if it gets into the wrong hands, bracing yourself for the inevitable backlash should a prankster decide to leave a dodgy voicemail on your boss’ cellphone or worse, order a thousand pizzas.
Your peace of mind will set you back $1.99 over at the BigBoss Repository – a default source in Cydia providing you’ve not deleted it.
Obviously, you’ll need to be running an SMS-compatible iOS device – known more commonly as the iPhone – and it’ll also need to be jailbroken, which takes the iPhone 4S out of contention. On a brighter note though, it runs on both iOS 4 and iOS 5.
You don’t have to. For nearly two decades, InfoWerks has utilized military-grade data security protocols, data asset verification systems and redundant data asset storage protocols. No other company adheres to such stringent standards.
InfoWerks Data Retention service delivers advanced security, combining remote backup, redundant off-site storage and simple, but secure, internet access.
Backup data is safely stored off-site with multi-level redundancy across our premier data centers, using industry-leading storage hardware. Tape-based backup? It’s outdated and prone to fail.
Our security policies are maintained to always exceed ever-changing HIPAA regulations. (So your feeling of complete peace of mind never changes.)
We are annually SOC-1 audited assuring you that our policies and procedures meet the industry’s highest regulatory standards.

Who was it that shot and killed Nathan Carmen's grandfather back in December of 2013 in Windsor, Connecticut? According to WFSB, Nathan's relatives believe he murdered his millionaire grandfather for inheritance money. Nathan says that it's simply untrue.
Even though Nathan is a suspect, he has never been charged in the killing, in fact, no one has been charged. Just recently Nathan, through his attorney says he has evidence that his grandfather's 25-year-old mistress was involved in the killing.
Carmen announced to the court that he thinks the mistress and some of her friends targeted the grandfather for his money. Carmen has appealed to the court to allow him to obtain a deposition so the mistress can be questioned. Carmen claims that his grandfather, John Chakalos was paying this unnamed woman for sexual favors. The court documents state:
Relatives believe that Nathan killed off Chakolos for his money and that he also killed his mother during a fishing trip in 2016 to collect insurance money for his boat. His relatives also claim that Nathan is in possession of the gun used in the killing. As of right now, there have been no arrests in the case.
A Danbury teen is facing 11 charges including assault on a police officer following an incident that happened in Newtown earlier last week.
According to the Newtown Police Department, officers attempted to stop a car on Sunday, October 7, that they say was carrying a rear license plate that didn't match and was also missing a front license plate altogether. Things reportedly escalated quickly when the person believed to have been driving the vehicle allegedly engaged in a pursuit with the police instead of pulling over.
At that point, the Newtown PD says the officers disengaged in the pursuit out of concern to the local community. Before long, however, Officer James reportedly spotted that same car on a side street and attempted to confront the driver. While Officer James was trying to disable the car, the operator allegedly hit the gas, dragging the officer and nearly crushing him between the vehicle and his patrol car.
A short time later, Officer James reportedly spotted the vehicle again, but by that time, it was left unoccupied. The Newtown PD brought in a K9 unit, which was able to track the movement of the suspects on foot, but lost the trail when the suspects were allegedly picked up by a car nearby.
The main suspect has since been identified as 18-year-old John Paul Suero of Danbury, on whom police were able to obtain an arrest warrant that held 11 charges. Among those charges were assault on a police officer, engaging in a pursuit and first degree larceny, as the vehicle is believed by police to have been stolen.
After a manhunt by both the Newtown and Danbury Police Departments this past Saturday (October 13) Suero, who aside from the warrant for this incident, had three other outstanding warrants for his arrest, was apprehended, held over the weekend on a $104,500 bond and transported to Danbury Superior for arraignment on Monday (October 15).

In an effort to close one of my other blogs that I don't use anymore, I'm going to be reposting things in here. The first is, of course, food.
Now as awesome as they are, there were things in there I couldn't do. For example, veal. I don't do veal. I wasn't too keen on the idea of milk in my meatballs*** either. However, I followed the basic idea of the recipe- as in baking them. I even went a step further and used them to make a tomato/red gravy/sauce*. Here's my interpretation of the meatballs. And my friends, it is REALLY worth it, either with the original or my alterations.
It's best to use dried herbs for this because it's not going simmer on the stove/in a crockpot like it should be.
Combine the tomato products with the herbs and blend it well; make sure the paste blends through- there should be no lumps. Allow this to heat through for about 1/2 an hour before proceeding to the second part.
In a 13X9 pan with high sides (or use a dutch oven if you have it), take a ladle or two of your gravy/sauce and coat the bottom.
Using an ice cream scoop, make the meatballs. Pack them well; you want to get rid of the air in them. Now pop it out and make sure it's round. repeat with all meat in the bowl. I got about 25 meatballs out of this.
Ladle the gravy/sauce over the meatball. Cover them with the sauce-- make sure there are no exposed parts of the meatballs.
Serve alone with crusty bread or over a little spaghetti. There should be WAY more tomato sauce than you need. Freeze or refrigerate for future use. I hope yours is as good as mine. Best Meatballs Ever.
My picture is coming; I'm using an old camera**** with a CompactFlash card and I have to go find the cord to up load the shot. I also meant to Pin This to Pinterest last week so that I could have for my October challenge, but I messed up. I won't count it, but I WILL share it.
*I hate getting into the argument about sauce and gravy, so I always refer to it this way. However, in my house it's always tomato sauce.
***I have been informed that using the milk with the breadcrumbs is meant to keep the meatballs moist; it's an interesting concept and I may give it a try next time, but these babies were plenty moist.

A lot of us choose fall as our preferred season for wedding but we miss out on all the fun that a summer wedding can offer. There is so much of amusement and decorative wonders one can practice. You have the wide beautiful blue-sky to welcome the newlywed couple as well as the cheek-kissing wind outdoors to make your day all the more memorable.
Because summer has so much to offer, people are more turning away from winter as their favorite wedding season. One may wonder why but the reasons are quite obvious – you can experience tons of new things under a warm sunny day than in a freezing snowy period. And since you have more options to ponder over, you may as well get married on the beach or somewhere near the lack without having to worry about freezing yourself to death. Besides, who does not want to hear “I present you the man and wife” from the minister under the cool breeze of summer beach?
Most importantly, let’s not forget flowers! You can get as plenty of flowers as you like for your wedding. So, without further adieu, let us all look at the reasons why you should think of getting married this summer.
We cannot stress enough the significance of summer for a wedding, because the weather is more consistent than any other season throughout the year. Sure, fall is a beautiful season, but again you can never be sure of the snowstorm. Spring is always full of surprises – you never know when the next tornado hits – and winter is a tough period to literally do anything. If you are living in Boston, you can hire limo Boston for your wedding from us, but think of it trapping on its way to altar in the snow. Ugly, isn’t it? We do not want you to get late on your wedding day, and besides Boston in summers is beautiful, picture-ready for your wedding.
While it is indeed a possibility that you can arrange an outdoor wedding in the winter, you still never know of the unwelcomed snow or heavy rain. But in summers, this thing is less of your concern – thanks to the beautiful sunny days and windy nights.
As we have mentioned above, a lot of people, especially the ones who are willing to opt for fete-themed weddings are more willing to invest their money in summer weddings because they have a clear sky outdoors and they can take the oath overlooking mountains or exchange the rings whilst dipping their feet in the waves of some fancy beach. If you are getting married in Massachusetts, imagine yourself getting out of our limo Boston near a fancy lake surrounded by tall thick trees and having rows filled with guest overlooking at you.

﻿ Roster and Records of Iowa Soldiers, War of the Rebellion – Regiment History 2nd Regiment Iowa Volunteer Infantry
Following closely upon the first call of President Lincoln, in which the State of Iowa was required to furnish one regiment of infantry, came the second call requiring the State to furnish two more regiments of Infantry. More than a sufficient number of companies to fill these two regiments were already organized, having enlisted under the first call of the President, and were waiting to be ordered into quarters by the Governor. These companies had all been eager to be assigned to the First Infantry, but only ten companies could be accepted for that regiment, and a laudable strife for admission into the Second and Third at once began among these sons of Iowa for the privilege of entering the service of their country, for which they had so anxiously waited. Under date of May 21, 1861, Governor Kirkwood sent the following reply to the Secretary of War:
Your telegraphic dispatch informing me that two more regiments of volunteers were required of this State, reached me on the 17th inst. I immediately ordered the ten companies selected as the Second Regiment to rendezvous at Keokuk by the 25th inst., there to be mustered into the service of the United States. I have also selected the companies to form the Third Regiment, and I have sent orders to them to rendezvous at the same place by the 3d of June proximo at furthest.
I hope both regiments will be promptly at Keokuk by the time named. The want of telegraphs and railroads in the interior of our State causes delay in the transmission of orders and the movement of troops, or these regiments would be at the place of rendezvous much sooner.
Notwithstanding the difficulties of transportation, the companies selected to compose the Second Regiment had all reached Keokuk before the date indicated in the Governor's order. There they were mustered into the service on the 27th and 28th days of May, 1861. The regiment was fortunate in the selection of its first field officers, who soon justified the good judgment shown by Governor Kirkwood in appointing them, by the skill and ability displayed in preparing the regiment for active service in the short time which elapsed before they were ordered to take the field against the enemy. Col. Samuel R. Curtis, a member of Congress from the First district of Iowa, resigned that office to accept a commission as Colonel of the Second Iowa Infantry. He was a graduate from the Military Academy at West Point, but had many years before resigned from the army to engage in civil engineering. Upon taking command of his regiment, he at once proceeded to instruct the officers and men in the details of their duty as soldiers. So promptly and well was this instruction given, and received, that the Second Regiment was the first to take the field, the First following but one day later, and the Third but a few days thereafter. On the 13th day of June, 1861, Colonel Curtis received a
telegram from General Nathaniel Lyon ordering him to at once move the troops under his command into the State of Missouri, with specific instructions to take military control of the lines of the Hannibal and St. Joseph and North Missouri Railroads.
Colonel Curtis states, in his official report to General Lyon, that he received the order at one o'clock a m. and that at five o'clock a. m, the Second Iowa was embarked on board the steamer Jennie Deans. Landing at Hannibal, Mo., the same day, Colonel Curtis at once proceeded to take military possession of the railroads indicated, using for that purpose the Second Iowa Infantry, the First Iowa Infantry, (which had followed from Keokuk and reached Hannibal on June 14th,) a detachment of the Sixteenth Illinois Infantry numbering 450, and 250 Home Guards which he found stationed at Hannibal upon his arrival there, making in all a force of about 2,700 under his command with which to execute the order of General Lyon, a seemingly impossible task, considering the length of the lines along which this small army was to be distributed; but without hesitation the order was obeyed. As he advanced, small forces of the enemy were encountered and quickly overcome; flags, munitions of war, prisoners and supplies were captured, and loyal and peaceable citizens assured protection. Leaving detachments to guard the bridges, buildings and other railroad property from destruction, he pressed forward, and at the conclusion of his report said "I arrived at St. Joseph June 15, 1861, and encamped a short distance below the city on the bank of the Missouri River. I had thus in fifty-six hours from the time your dispatch reached me at Keokuk taken military possession of the entire road and established a sufficient guard along the line to protect it, and at the same time scattered and disorganized the rebel forces that were mustering through this portion of Missouri." Colonel Curtis then gives in detail the disposition of his troops at the various points along the line of the railroad. Upon his arrival at St. Joseph, he found a force of 650 Union troops which had been sent there by General Lyon. When the expedition started from Hannibal, Colonel Curtis was not aware of the presence of these troops at the other end of the line. While they did not directly cooperate in his expedition, the fact that they were already in possession of the city when he arrived there was an important factor in the success of this most remarkable military achievement. The promptness with which the order was obeyed alone saved this important line of railroad for the transportation of Union troops and supplies, and prevented a more prolonged resistance by the rebel forces in that portion of the State of Missouri. Colonel Curtis was promptly promoted to the rank of Brigadier General and later was given the rank of Major General. The Second Iowa Infantry thus began its military career under an able leader whose influence and example was an inspiration to the splendid officers who subsequently became its commanders succeeding each other in vacancies caused by promotion, by death on the battlefield, and by disabling wounds. The regiment rendered important service during the campaign in the summer of 1861 and most of the winter of 1862. The principal points from which it operated were as follows: St. Joseph Mo.; United States Arsenal, St. Louis, Mo.; Bird's Point, Mo.; Ironton, Mo. Pilot Knob, Mo.; Jackson, Mo.; Fort Jefferson, Ky.; Benton Barracks, St. Louis; Military Prison, McDowell's College, St. Louis. Leaving the last named station on the 10th day of February, 1862, the regiment was transferred by boat to Fort Donelson, Tenn., where it participated in the siege and capture of that stronghold and opened the way for the passage of the Union troops up the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers. The regiment was at that time under the command of Col. J. M. Tuttle from whose official report to Col. J. G. Lauman,
When we arrived at the top of the hill nearly opposite the right of the enemy's works, in pursuance of an order from you, I deployed companies A and B as skirmishers. They immediately crossed a ravine in front of our line, and skirmished until night, when they were called in. In the meantime the regiment was assigned position on the extreme left of our forces, where we spent a cold and disagreeable night, without tents or blankets. We remained in this position until 2 o'clock P. M. of the next day, when we were ordered to storm the fortifications of the enemy in front by advancing the left wing of the regiment supported a short distance in the rear by the right wing. I took command of the left wing in person and proceeded in line of battle steadily up the hill until we reached the fortifications without firing a gun. On reaching the works, we found the enemy flying before us, except a few who were promptly put to the bayonet. 3 I then gave the order to fire which was responded to with fatal precision until the right wing with Lieutenant Colonel Baker arrived, headed by General Smith, when we formed in line of battle again, under a galling fire, and charged on the encampment across the ravine in front, the enemy still retreating before us. After we had reached the summit of the hill beyond the ravine, we made a stand and occupied it for over an hour.
Soon afterwards I retired from the field owing to an injury received as reported among the casualties of the engagement, leaving Lieutenant Colonel Baker in command until the following morning, when the enemy gave signal for a parley, which was succeeded by the enjoyable intelligence that they had surrendered the fort. We were then ordered by General Smith to take the post of honor, in marching to the fort, where we placed our colors upon the battlements beside the white flag of the enemy, for which generous consideration the General has our hearty thanks.
The compiler of this history has before him the original telegram from Major General H. W. Halleck, addressed to Adjutant General N. B. Baker of Iowa, dated at Department Headquarters, St. Louis, February 19, 1862, which reads as follows:
The Second Iowa Infantry proved themselves the bravest of the brave. They had the honor of leading the column which entered Fort Donelson.
Colonel Tuttle then goes on to mention by name those who especially distinguished themselves by coolness and bravery in the assault upon the fort. Of those in the most responsible positions, he mentions Lieutenant Colonel Baker, Major Chipman and Adjutant Tuttle, and says of them:
They were gallant to perfection. Lieutenant Colonel Baker had a ball pass through his cap and come out near his temple, Major Chipman was among the first to fall severely wounded, while cheering on the men of the left wing, and refused to be carried from the field, but waved his sword and exhorted the men to press forward. Captains Slaymaker and Cloutman fell dead at the head of their companies before they reached the entrenchments. Near them fell Lieutenant Harper. His death was that of a true and brave soldier. Captains Cox, Mills, Moore and Wilkins were at the head of their companies, marked examples of gallantry and efficiency. Lieutenants Scofield, Ensign, Davis, Holmes, Huntington, Weaver Mastic, Snowden and Godfrey, in fact nearly all of my officers, commissioned and non-commissioned, deported themselves nobly throughout the engagement, Sergeant Major Brawner deserves very honorable mention for his gallant conduct. Surgeons Marsh and Nassau also deserve the highest praise for their skill and untiring devotion to the welfare of the wounded. Dr. Nassau was particularly noticed for his bravery on the field, taking off the wounded during a heavy fire from the enemy. I cannot omit in this report an account of the Color Guard. Color Sergeant Doolittle fell early in the engagement pierced by four balls, and dangerously wounded. The colors were then taken by Corporal
Page of Company B who soon fell, dead. They were again raised by Corporal Churcher of company I who had his arm broken just as he entered the entrenchments, when they were taken by Corporal Twombly of company F, who was almost instantly knocked down by a spent ball, but he immediately rose and bore them gallantly to the end of the fight. Not a single man of the Color Guard, but himself, was on his feet at the close of the engagement.
Thus, in its first great battle, so important in its results, the Second Iowa Infantry bore such a conspicuous part as to be accorded the post of honor by being placed in the vanguard of the troops who took possession of the stronghold they had fought so bravely to subdue. The news of the splendid manner in which they had sustained the flag of their country was heard with glad acclaim, mingled with mourning for the gallant dead, throughout the State of Iowa, and served as an inspiration to those who were rallying to the defense of their country, and eagerly waiting for the opportunity to take the places of their fallen comrades.
On the 19th day of March, 1862, the Second Iowa Infantry disembarked at Pittsburg Landing, Tenn., and went into camp. On the 6th and 7th days of April, 1862, the regiment participated in the great battle of Shiloh under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Baker, Colonel Tuttle, having won the rank of Brigadier General at Donelson, being placed in command of a brigade composed of the Second, Seventh, Twelfth and Fourteenth Iowa Infantry. In his official report Tuttle says, "Lieutenant Colonel Baker distinguished himself for bravery and ability on the field." He further states that, "The officers deserving special mention in this report are so numerous that I will confine myself to the field officers alone."
Diligent search of the files in the office of the Adjutant General of Iowa, of the copies of reports published by Adjutant General Baker, and of the War of the Rebellion records published by the War Department, fails to reveal the report of Lieutenant Colonel Baker of the part taken by his regiment at Shiloh. Surviving officers of the regiment state that such report was made, and that it contained special mention of the meritorious conduct of many of the officers and enlisted men, but it seems to have been unaccountably lost. Recourse is therefore again had to the Brigade Commander's report to show how well and bravely the regiment fought at Shiloh:
On the morning of the 6th, my brigade, under the direction of Gen. W. H. L. Wallace, commanding Second Division, formed line on the left of his division. we had been in line but a few moments when the enemy made their appearance and attacked my left wing (Twelfth and Fourteenth Iowa) who gallantly stood their ground, and compelled their assailants to retire in confusion. They again formed under cover of a battery, and renewed the attack upon my whole line, but were repulsed as before. A third and fourth time they dashed upon us, but were each time baffled and completely routed. We held our position about six hours, when it became evident that our forces on each side of us had given way so as to give the enemy an opportunity to turn both flanks. At this critical juncture, General Wallace gave orders for my whole brigade to fall back, which was done in good order. The Second and Seventh retired through a severe fire from both flanks, and reformed, while the Twelfth and Fourteenth, who were delayed by their endeavors to save a battery which had been placed in their rear, were completely surrounded and compelled to surrender.
The two regiments of Tuttle's command, the Second and Seventh Iowa, which had escaped capture, reinforced by fragments of other regiments, constituted an important part of the line of last resistance at Shiloh on the 6th of April, and again the regiment occupied a post of honor. On Monday, the 7th, the Second Iowa was placed under the orders of General Nelson and made a bayonet charge in a most gallant manner, the enemy giving way before
them. It will thus be seen that the regiment well sustained at Shiloh the record it had made at Donelson.
After the battle of Shiloh, the regiment took part in all the operations leading up to the investment and siege of Corinth, and in the siege of that place, which was finally evacuated by the enemy on the 30th of May, 1862. The regiment was stationed at Camp Montgomery, near Corinth, Miss., during the remainder of the summer of 1862, co-operating with the operations of the First Brigade Second Division of the army of the Mississippi, until the 3d day of October, 1862, when it became engaged in that fierce and bloody contest which lasted for two days, and in which its percentage of loss, in proportion to the number engaged, was greater than at Donelson or Shiloh. The compiler of this history considers that the publication of the official report of the part taken by the regiment in the battle of Corinth is requisite, in order that its heroic record may not be abridged, and the report is herewith given:
SIR: In compliance with your order, I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by the Second Iowa Infantry regiment in the engagement which took place at Corinth, Miss., on the 3d and 4th instant:
The regiment went into battle on the morning of the 3d commanded by Col. James Baker, with three field, two staff, and twenty-one line officers, and three hundred and twenty men, making an aggregate of three hundred and forty-six. In the first day's battle near White House, which was most stubbornly contested, the loss of the regiment was very heavy, particularly in officers. In this action three Lieutenants were killed, First Lieutenant John G. Huntington of Company B. First Lieutenant Thomas Snowden of Company I, First Lieutenant Alfred Bing of Company C: Enlisted men, Corporal Wesley H. Henderson. Privates, John W. Dunn, Marion French and James G. Mansell, making a total of seven killed. Wounded, Colonel James Baker (mortally); Second Lieutenant V. P. Twombly, severely. Enlisted men, thirty-one; missing, two; making an aggregate of forty-two killed, wounded and missing in the first day's engagement. In the engagement of the 4th, Second Lieutenant George W. Neal of Company H Corporals Henry A. Sieberlich, A. Stevenson and Jacob A. Moles; Privates, John M. Renz, John Clough, W. W. K. Harper, W. M. Summers, Charles E. Walker, John W. Downes and Franklin Prouty, were killed. Wounded, Lieutenant Colonel Mills (mortally), Captain N. B. Howard of Company I (slightly); First Lieutenant C. C. Parker of Company F ( severely); Second Lieutenant George W. Blake of Company K (dangerously); Second Lieutenant Frank M. Suiter of Company B (severely) Enlisted men,Forty-four; missing one; captured, one; total killed, wounded and missing in both days' engagement, 108.
In this protracted and desperate engagement, in many respects the most desperate of the war, the officers and men displayed the most laudable gallantry and heroism, Colonel Baker fell mortally wounded on the first day, at the very time his regiment was charging on the retreating enemy with the greatest enthusiasm and fury. He remarked as he was being borne from the field, "Thank God when I fell my regiment was victoriously charging." Lieutenant Colonel Mills was wounded in the second day's engagement, while fighting with the most conspicuous courage and coolness. He was loath to leave the field. Better or truer officers never fought. Exposed to every danger, they were ever conspicuous for their cool, daring courage, and the patriotic ardor of their souls, which inspired every officer and soldier under their command. Colonel Baker expired on the morning of the 7th at 11 o'clock and Lieutenant Colonel Mills on the 121h at 7 o'clock. May their memory ever be cherished by their countrymen. Lieutenants Huntington, Snowden, Bing and Neal fell at their posts fighting like heroes. They died as becomes patriots; fully as much can be said of the enlisted men who fell. All honor to their memory.
Among those who distinguished themselves was Adjutant Geo. L. Godfrey, who was always to be seen and heard charging along the line upon his horse shouting to the men to be cool and steady. He is one of the most valuable young officers with whom I have ever met. Captains Cowles, McCullough, Mastic, Howard, Ensign and Davis were marked instances of bravery and efficiency upon the field and reflected great credit upon themselves and their commands. Captain Holmes, on account of a wound received in battle of Fort Donelson, was unable to take command of his company during the engagement. Conspicuous for bravery were Lieutenants Parker, Duffield, Marsh, Wilson, Tisdale, Suiter, Hamill, Hall, Blake, Duckworth, Ballinger, Twombly and McCoid. After Lieutenants Parker and Twombly of company F were wounded, Sergeant James Ferry took charge of the company and rendered most satisfactory service.
Too much credit cannot be bestowed upon our excellent First Assistant Surgeon Elliott Pyle, then in charge of the medical department of the regiment, who was most indefatigable in his attentions to the wounded, nor upon our Quartermaster Sergeant John Lynde, who was ever present upon the field to supply the wants of the men. Sergeant Major Campbell distinguished himself throughout the battle for coolness and bravery.
Color Sergeant Harry Doolittle, while supporting the colors, was again wounded, and Color Corporals Henry A. Seiberlich, G. C. Phillips, G. B. Norris, J. C. Urie and John H. Stewart were all wounded while supporting the old flag.
I join with you, and my countrymen, in the deepest regret for the gallant slain. Their sacrifices make our Constitution still more valuable to the civilized world. While we mourn their loss we can rejoice that they died like true heroes for their beloved country. How precious their memory. How sacred their dust. They died for the cause of Christianity and constitutional liberty. After the fall of Lieutenant Colonel Mills, which took place about 9 o'clock on Saturday, the command devolved upon myself. There were thirty-one prisoners and one stand of colors captured by the regiment.
After the battle of Corinth, the regiment, now decimated in number by its heavy losses in battle, continued in active service in the states of Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia, during the fall, winter, spring and early summer of 1862 and 1863, and contributed its full share to the success of the operations against the enemy, up to, and culminating in, the fall of Atlanta and the march to the sea, and on to Washington. During this period of its service, it participated in the following engagements:
Little Bear Creek, Alabama, November 28, 1862. Town Creek, Ala., April, 1863. Resaca, Ga., May 14 and 15, 1864. Rome Cross Roads May 16, 1864. Dallas, Ga., May 27, 28 and 29, 1864. Kenesaw Mountain, Ga. June 10 to 30, 1864 (Siege). Nickajack Creek, Ga., July 4, 1864. In front of Atlanta, July 22, 1864, and siege of Atlanta to August 27, 1864. Advance on Jonesboro, Ga., August 30, 1864. Jonesboro, Ga., August 31, 1864. Eden Station, Ga. December 7, 1864. Little Ogechie, Ga., December 10 to 20, 1864. Savannah, Ga. December 21, 1864. Columbia, S. C., February 15 and 16, 1865. Lynches Creek S. C., February 26, 1865, and Bentonsville, N. C., March 18 and 21, 1865. This ended the fighting record of this veteran organization. On the 24th day of May, 1865, the regiment reached Washington, D. C., thus completing a triumphant march, which will be forever memorable in the military annals of the world. The regiment participated in that great military pageant, the grand review in Washington, and remained in camp near that city until early in June, 1865. It then proceeded to Louisville, Ky., where it was mustered out of the service July 12, 1865, having served the United States Government well and faithfully for over four years. It then proceeded to Davenport, Iowa, where it disbanded July 20, 1865, and the survivors returned to their homes.
The subjoined roster, with the record of service paragraphed opposite each name, together with a summary of casualties, list of those confined in Confederate prisons, and buried in National Cemeteries, makes up a record of bravery, of suffering and fortitude, that will compare favorably with that of any regiment, from any State, in that Grand Army of the Republic, the survivors of which are now venerable with age, and whose numbers are rapidly diminishing with the passing years.
At the date of the completion of this historical sketch, August 20, 1907, relatively few of the nearly two thousand men who, first and last, marched and fought with this splendid regiment, remain upon earth. When this history and revised roster shall have been published and ready for distribution, a still smaller number of survivors will remain to peruse it, but a great and grateful commonwealth will have discharged its duty in preserving for all time this record of faithful and patriotic service of the men whose brave deeds are herein recorded, to be read and cherished by their children, and children's children, and by all the patriotic sons and daughters of Iowa, to their latest posterity.
Samuel R. Curtis was born in Ohio, February 3, 1807. In 1821, he was appointed to a cadetship at West Point. After graduating, he served as Second Lieutenant in the Seventh Infantry for a year, and then resigned to engage in civil engineering in Ohio. He was Colonel of the Third regiment of Ohio Infantry Volunteers in the Mexican war. At the beginning of the War of the Rebellion, he was living in Keokuk, and was the representative in Congress of the First of the then two congressional Districts of Iowa.
Upon the organization of the Second Iowa Infantry, he was unanimously elected Colonel of the regiment. He rose to the rank of Major General, and rendered distinguished service as the commander of the Army of the Southwest. He won a decisive victory over the rebel army at the battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, and was afterwards in command of the Departments of Missouri and Arkansas. He never lost a battle.

This paper explores the case of the Indian and Malay Muslim minority diasporas in South Africa and their use of community radio to negotiate collective social and political identities. In post-apartheid South Africa, community radio has become a vastly popular medium and has quickly fulfilled a need to express and celebrate local identities in a manner that contrasts with the formerly government-controlled and white-dominated communication system. In this paper, I focus on the cases of Al-Ansaar radio managed by the South African Indian Muslim community in Durban and Voice of the Cape radio run by Muslims of Malay origin in Cape Town. Though the two communities are united by religion, they have different racial and ethnic backgrounds and different legal and political histories under colonialism and also under the apartheid racialist system. Informed by an analysis of radio programs, site visits and interviews with staff in both stations conducted in July 2012, and against the backdrop of the different histories of both communities in South Africa, I explore how Muslims of Indian and Malay origins articulate their religious, cultural, and ethnic identities through local radio. I argue that the ways that these community radios discursively construct a new ‘global Islamic’ identity is in tension with how both Muslim communities interact with each other and position themselves, politically and economically, within the larger South African nation. I contend that the rise of expressions of Islam in South Africa is not necessarily an indication of a decline in ‘race-thinking’ within the diverse Islamic minority but also as a reflection of an anxiety over the positioning of these communities within the new post-apartheid democratic political system. This case-study also reveals the impact not only of apartheid but also the history of colonialism on the Indian and Malay diaspora communities and the ways they articulate their identities and relate to each other. Finally, this case-study also points to the centrality of community radio as a vehicle for renewed attempts of constructing diaspora identities and, in the case of South Africa, for resisting the main national political narrative about the unity of the “rainbow nation.”

(LifeWire) -- When a 24-year-old woman who called herself "90DayJane" launched a blog in February announcing she would write about her life and feelings for three months and then commit suicide, 150,000 readers flocked to the site. Some came to offer help, some to delight in the drama. Others speculated it was all a hoax.
Stacey Kim says blogging helps her cope with being a widow and a single mom to twins Riley, left, and Madeleine.
Few, however, questioned why she would share her deepest thoughts and feelings with strangers online. In the age of cyber-voyeurism, the better question might be: Why wouldn't she?
Overeating, alcoholism, depression -- name the problem and you'll find someone's personal blog on the subject. Roughly 12 million Americans have blogs, according to polls by the Pew Internet and American Life Project in 2006, and many seem to use them as a form of group therapy.
A 2005 survey by Digital Marketing Services for AOL.com a found nearly half of the 600 people polled derived therapeutic benefits from personal blogging.
For Stacey Kim, a 36-year-old book editor who lives in the Boston suburb of Arlington, Massachusetts, emotional blogging has become a reflex. On April 11, 2007, Kim curled up next to her husband and held him as he succumbed to a long battle with pancreatic cancer. The next morning, she went online to post about the experience.
"It cemented the reality that he was gone," Kim says. "I got hundreds of comments back that were all so loving and supportive. It gave me a really tangible sense of community."
"Right after he died, people kept asking if I was in therapy," says Kim, "and I'd say, 'No, but I have a blog.'"
Writing long has been considered a therapeutic outlet for people facing problems. A 2003 British Psychological Society study of 36 people suggested that writing about emotions could even speed the healing of physical wounds: Researchers found that small wounds healed more quickly in those who wrote about traumatic personal events than in those who wrote about mundane activities.
Reading someone else's blog can be surprisingly beneficial, says MightyGirl.net blogger Margaret Mason, 32. She reads about other women's experiences with everything from in-laws to apartment-hunting at blogs like SuburbanBliss.net and SuperHeroDesigns.com.
"Blogging can create an instant support system, especially at a time when you might not have the energy or resources to seek out people who've shared your experiences," says Mason, author of "No One Cares What You Had For Lunch," a book on keeping a blog interesting.
John Suler, a psychology professor at Rider University in New Jersey, has studied the overlap of psychology and cyberspace. Blog audiences are usually small, he says, but "going public with one's thoughts and experiences can be a self-affirming process."
He and other experts say blogging shouldn't replace face-to-face counseling -- although it can complement sessions when a patient shares their writing with the therapist.
"Some psychologists take special interest in any activities that their clients may undertake online," Suler says, "because such activities often reveal a lot about how they express their identity and relate to other people."
Kim did start psychotherapy, but kept blogging. "My therapist will give me little assignments and I'll blog about them," she says. "If I come home (after a session) and write about it, it solidifies it."
One Chicago licensed social worker and therapist in her 50s encourages patients to release bottled emotions through blogging. Leah, who asked that her last name not be used because of the nature of her profession, started EveryoneNeedsTherapy.blogspot.com to share professional insights.
Soon, however, she was talking about her own feelings -- and her husband told her it seemed to lift her mood.
"It's a form of group therapy," says Leah. "Not only can you express your feelings, but you can get comments, and that creates a dialogue."
Blogging about personal matters seems to be more of a feminine pursuit. In the 2004 study "Effects of Age and Gender on Blogging," researchers examined more than 37,000 blogs on blogger.com. Their conclusion: Male bloggers tend to write about politics, technology and money; women are more likely to blog about their private lives and use an intimate style of writing.
"Women tend to self-disclose more online in general," says the senior director at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Talented Youth. "Women far outnumber men in certain blogging worlds in which feelings are shared, such as cancer blogs."
The only problem, some bloggers find, is that many posts become passé -- yet they're on the Web forever.
"The Internet takes momentary thoughts and freezes them in amber as if they're permanent," says Scheherazade Mason, a career counselor and sailing coach at Bowdoin College in Maine. She stopped posting her deepest thoughts, but calls the experience positive.
"Through my first blog, I learned to be braver," Mason says. "I learned that my weakness was also likable. In real life, you try to show only strength and to hide your weaknesses, but I exposed everything."
90DayJane also said she learned important things. After seven days, she announced the blog was an art project and she wasn't planning to kill herself.
"I wanted this blog to be about personal discovery and truth," she wrote in her final post. "But the correspondences I have received have taught me more about those qualities than I could ever express. 90DayJane ... has changed my perspective as a human being."

Sources say Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud, here in November 2008, was injured in a suspected U.S. drone strike.
Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Taliban in Pakistan have released a second audiotape purportedly containing the voice of their leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, who sources say was wounded in a suspected drone strike this week.
The group also released an audiotape Friday, though CNN could not confirm that the voice on either tape belongs to Mehsud. It was unclear whether the first tape was recorded before or after Thursday's drone strike, but the voice on the second tape announced the date as Saturday.
"Let me say this briefly, that I, Hakimullah Mehsud, today, on the 16th of January, with central spokesman Azam Tariq and Umar Khittab, want to give this message to all mujahedeen: that by the grace of Allah, I, Hakimullah Mehsud, am alive and in good health. Neither have I been martyred in a drone attack nor injured," the voice says on Saturday's tape.
Tariq, a Taliban spokesman, denied Thursday and again Friday that Mehsud was hurt. Tariq said Mehsud had left the site of the attack -- a converted religious school -- before the missiles struck. He dismissed reports of an injury to Mehsud as propaganda.
However, other Taliban and intelligence sources said doctors were treating Mehsud for wounds he sustained in the drone strike.
On the tape released Friday, the voice says, "The media right now is also part of the war. The enemy through the media wants to demoralize the Taliban. At times they spread the propaganda in the media that 'We have martyred Hakimullah.' At other times they say, 'We have completed the operation in South Waziristan,' but this will never happen."
The drone strike hit a madrassa, or religious school, that local officials said had been converted into a militant training camp. Ten people were killed in the strike, Pakistani intelligence and local officials said.
"I want to inform the Pakistani people that the drone attacks that take place in the tribal areas endanger the politics, well-being and sovereignty of Pakistan," the speaker says. "From today onward, for any dangerous step that the Pakistani Taliban will take in Pakistan, those responsible will be Pakistan's rulers, not the Taliban. This is because the Pakistani rulers want to spill the blood of the innocent [tribesmen] in exchange for dollars."
The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by drones, or unmanned aircraft. The United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft.
Last week, the Taliban released a video showing Mehsud sitting next to Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, the man who killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian army captain at an eastern Afghan base December 30.
The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack. It was carried out out to avenge the death of Mehsud's predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, who died in a suspected U.S. drone strike last year, according to al Qaeda's commander of operations in Afghanistan, Mustafa Abu Yazid.

Kate Chopin clearly sympathizes with the plight of people of mixed blood and points out the evils of a slave system that at once creates and condemns miscegenation. Her chief concern, however, is not with the South’s “peculiar institution,” a topic she rarely treated in her fiction. Rather, she concerns herself with her characters’ inner lives.
Certainly these lives confront external constraints. Désirée and Armand live in a world that values racial purity. To be black is to be condemned to a life of subservience; to be white is to inherit mastery. No matter how beautiful or how fair one may be, blood rules. Armand spends much time in the cottage of a slave named La Blanche, whose name suggests her skin color. Still, she is of mixed race, so she is a slave, and the quadroon boy who fans Désirée’s baby is probably the son of Armand and La Blanche. The most such a woman can hope for is to be treated well by her master and to be his concubine because she will never be his wife. Among Creoles, who pride themselves not only on their racial purity but also on their French heritage, the proper pedigree is especially important.
The characters’ world is also one in which women, like blacks, are second-class citizens. Women have certain fixed roles—daughter, wife, mother. Désirée’s world is small, moving between the neighboring plantations of her foster parents and her husband. She passes her days inside, and Armand is free to come...
There used to be a time where white people thought having African American blood in your family was wrong. It was thought of as a shame to your family or a disgrace to the name. Kate Chopin tells a story about a wife and husband who have a new child. Desiree, a white orphan that was adopted by the Valmonde family, is enthralled about the arrival of her baby boy and her husband Armand, a strict slave owner is also excited to see his first born son. However, the family begins to realize that something is mysteriously wrong with the newborn. They begin to notice that he is acquiring the traits of an African American and soon the couple start to narrow down the possibilities of the situation. In the story “Desiree’s Baby”, Kate Chopin uses symbolism and foreshadowing to portray that there is something eccentric about the baby and creates a mysterious plot that keeps the audience looking out for these clues.
With the use of many symbols in her story, Chopin gives the audience insight into the depths of her work. Examples of this symbolism include the stone pillar, La Blanche’s cabin, and the bonfire. The stone pillar that Desiree was found lying upon by Armand when he had first “fallen in love with her”(1) was used to show her desolate background. Armand uses this symbol as a sense of safety because he knows he will be able to use Desiree’s unknown decent to blame her for a future failure or to cover up his own mistakes. At the end of the piece, we find out that the baby is mixed and Armand blames Desiree. Neither of them knows who really has African American in their blood but he automatically assumes that it is her because no one knows who her real parents are being that she is adopted.
”And the way he cries,” went on Desiree,” is deafening. Armand heard him the other day as far away as La Blanche’s cabin”(2), this is a strange line in the story and makes the reader question why Armand was in La Blanche’s cabin and what he was actually doing while he was there. This might suppose that Armand is having relations with his slaves. If this is true then it is possible that the quadroon boys are his children because he is “white’ and the mother is black. Oddly enough, the author does not make Desiree recognize Armand’s words and she never says anything to her husband about it which makes it difficult to recognize.
There are many foreshadowing examples that help the reader figure out what is going on in the work. One of the first foreshadowing elements is from Madame Volmonde, Desiree’s orphan mother, “This is not the baby!” she exclaimed, in startling tones.”(1) This hints the reader that something is odd about the child and it also informs them to look out for other information regarding the baby. “Madame Valmonde had never removed her eyes from the child. She lifted it and walked with it over to the window that was the lightest”(1), the author uses these sentences to show that the baby’s skin color was strange and the family had noticed it.
Although they had not quite figured out what was awkward, many things started to change starting when Desiree compared her baby to the quadroon boys. “She looked from her child to the boy who stood beside him, and back again; over and over.”(3) She then knew that her baby was mixed and Desiree immediately goes to Armand and asks him what it means.” It means,” he answered lightly, “that the child is not white; it means that you are not white”(3), this indicates that Armand believes she is mixed but she protest against him.
In the end of Kate Chopin’s work Desiree and the baby leave on foot. “She did not take the broad, beaten road which led to the far-off plantation of Volmonde. She walked across a deserted field, where the stubble bruised her tender feet, so delicately shod, and tore her thin gown to shreds”(5), indicates that her and the baby did not make it. With Desiree and the baby already gone, the reader finds the ending to be ironic when Armand finds out his mother is Black and this gives a sense of closure to end the piece. Chopin uses the elements of symbolism and foreshadowing to create a more mysterious plot that keeps her readers interested throughout the entirety of the story but also so they can go deeper into the meaning and theme of it as a whole.

You almost feel sorry for the boy as he's jammed stiff and then splashed with Deacon's cum, made to taste it and smeared with his juice, but not sorry enough to want to stop it
Yes, yes and MORE YES! Finally got the opportunity to actually try out my new spiralizer and the thing is awesome! It’s the same one my girlfriend in NY has, the Paderno World Cuisine Spiralizer Pro and I love it! So it has these feet that are suction cups, and yeah… you need to make sure those little feet are 100% stuck to the counter, haha. I did not make sure to do that and the thing was moving all the over place. I was thinking well this is stupid.. then I reread the directions and OH! There are suction feet! Ha, oops! So once I got the feet suctioned to the counter (took a whole 2 seconds) the spiralizing went smoothly. I know, I know, always read the directions in their entirety before starting to use something new. I did read the directions, just not very thoroughly I guess, lol.
We will be eating these zoodles tonight with chicken meatballs and homemade tomato sauce. Last time we had “spaghetti” we used spaghetti squash, and I really think it’ll be better with zoodles. Plus, spaghetti squash is a pain to properly cut in half length wise, or maybe my knives are dull, but either way, this was super easy and I know it’ll be delicious! It would be super cool if our 8 year old likes the zoodles too, but I’m not holding my breath on that one.
Now that I have spiralized a zucchini, what else can I spiralize! I found this great website today, inspiralized.com and it has a ton of great ideas! Fries, noodles, salads, tons of stuff to make! I cannot wait to get spiralizing more! Hopefully I’ll be able to add to my recipes and make even more easy and delicious recipes! As I use my spiralizer more, I will be posting new information about it, which veggies worked well and were yummy and which didn’t work so well or didn’t pass ours and our kids’ taste bud tests, and lots of pictures! 🙂
Seriously, leftovers rock! I hardly had to cook at all today, all thanks to leftovers. I did make another batch of Whole30 chicken meatballs which have become a bit of a staple in our home. The kids love them, hubby loves them, and I love them. The chicken meatballs from the Whole30 book is definitely a killer recipe! I know, we’re technically done with our Whole30 program… today is the 36th day we’ve been eating according to the program… but we like how we feel so much that we just don’t want to stop eating this way. Considering how busy I was today, and knowing that our Whole30 is over, pizza did cross my mind. But I also have no interest in dealing with the heartburn and other issues we used to have again, so we opted to just finish up everything in the fridge.
I barely managed to get my workout done today because it was a busy day and things kept coming up and pushing my timeline back. Having healthy leftovers to eat made it easy for us to heat them up and stick to our healthy habits without much effort. Love it!
My hubby mentioned that to me today, he laughed, me in my frilly apron, barefoot in the kitchen, literally all. day. long. It was the perfect day to cook up a storm and prep some things for the week ahead!
My day started off eating healthy.. I had some frittata leftover from the other day. I then made some awesome Whole30 chicken meatballs (check out some other awesome Whol30 recipes here!).. Followed by making mayo and then ranch dressing.
Back to the kitchen! Cooked some perfect bacon, made 4 small jars of clarified butter, and started on my new creation, Bacon & Ranch Chicken. This recipe is delicious! Hubby liked it, the kids liked it, our dogs would have loved it if they’d gotten any (sorry boys!), and it was fantastic over some steamed broccoli. Kale or salad would have been great too. We have some leftovers so I will most likely be having the chicken and bacon on a salad for lunch tomorrow.. Love me some leftovers! Makes eating healthy for lunch super easy.. Total no-brainer
Today was definitely a busy day in the kitchen, but it was totally worth it! I have enough mayo to make ranch for at least a few more days and clarified butter that should last a nice long time. Now that I have some staples done I can relax a little and just enjoy cooking (and eating!) for the next few days without needing to do anything in particular.
If you can make time to spend a whole day in the kitchen and get some of your main staples for the week ready, it makes eating healthy much easier and less stressful in terms of must do things each day. Love it. Love how I feel. Love that my family now enjoys healthy food.. Couldn’t ask for more!
Snacking is a wonderful thing that gets so many of us into trouble when we’re trying to stay healthy or lose some weight. In my mind, snacks are supposed to be quick and easy, which often leads to terrible food choices. I know from my personal experience that I would grab just about anything for a snack as long as it took virtually zero effort to prepare. For me this meant open package, shove junk in face. Totally not a healthy way to eat. I’m talking pre-packaged peanut butter crackers, pre-packaged “health” bars (read the labels recently, so much unnecessary added sugar!), pre-packaged fruits (another attempt at health, but they have preservatives that fresh fruits don’t)… there’s a pattern here. PRE-PACKAGED.
I now create my own “pre-packaged” snacks that I can grab quickly without thinking. Carrots peeled and cut into sticks and/or broccoli chopped into bite sized pieces, put into snack size Ziploc bags are just as easy to grab as a pack of peanut butter crackers! Mandarin oranges, peeled, broken into nice pieces, also placed into snack size bags, another quick and easy to grab snack. And of course, these are FRESH fruits and vegetables. I am now putting a lot more effort into food preparation so I can make sure our family has healthy snacks to grab without all the added sugars, preservatives, and who knows what other junk!
I find that all my preparation has been especially important for our kids. Hubby and I don’t snack since doing The Whole30… we don’t really need to with three great Whole30 meals a day. But we do have two growing boys and even with three solid, healthy meals a day, they still snack. They need more food to fuel their constantly growing bodies and I am now doing my best to ensure the things they snack on are healthy foods. Don’t get me wrong, slowly swapping to way healthier snacks hasn’t been a smooth road. The kids didn’t jump for joy at the prospect of eating less junk. However, they are getting used to eating healthier. For our family, we’ve decided to get the kids into it at our own pace, not trying to make a bunch of changes all at once. This is working for our family, though something else may work for another family. It all depends on personal preference.
Trying out different types of healthy snacks will highly benefit everyone in your family in the long run. Take the time to prepare snacks ahead of time and keep them on hand. Our goal has been to make the healthy snack choices easier to grab than the unhealthy ones 🙂
Yep, HEALTHY carnitas!!! We ate them over kale with guacamole (a recipe I made up and will be posting soon) and the Whole30 salsa recipe (I excluded the jalepeno for the sake of our youngest). The dinner was amazing! It is easy to eat grass-fed meat, organic fruits and vegetables, AND have it taste amazing!
Today was really busy! My grandparents came by and dropped some awesome looking homemade cherry jam and some homemade mango jam! Unfortunately for me, jam means sugar:( But the kids can have some, which they will love!
I also went grocery shopping today. Got enough meat for 3 full days of all meals and enough vegetables for the week. Thinking ahead and shopping smart is what makes eating healthy work for me and my family.
If you’re trying to eat healthy and stay in shape, keep it up! Remember, it takes planning, support and motivation!!! You can do it:)
Today was a pretty normal day as far as eating goes. We’ve “finished” our Whole30 but are sticking to the overall idea (and grocery list) because we really love the food! Hubby’s dad was in town last night and this morning, and he had Whole30 compliant dinner and breakfast with us. He really enjoyed the meals. Our kids enjoy the meals. Everything is super healthy and yummy. Changing the way we’ve been eating just because we’re done with our 30 days seems silly to us.
I made some guacamole this afternoon to have with my salad (super good!) and I made a pot roast for dinner tonight. What I did tonight was insanely easy. That’s the point of this post… it’s super healthy, it’s delicious, kids like it, and it’s EASY and FAST. I was actually very lucky that the yellow squash I used for dinner tonight was straight from my father-in-law’s garden, so it was 100% organic, no pesticides, and super yummy! They actually had a bit of a sweetness to them 🙂 I also got 2 giant zucchini (seriously, those suckers are BIG!) and some sweet peppers. This will definitely put a nice little dent in my grocery bill!
Prep Work – just 10 minutes – keep in mind non of the copping needs to be pretty, which is why it’s so quick!
Prepped the beef roast (just chopped off a little fat and cut it into about 3 inch pieces) – 2 minutes
Cooking (time spent actually paying attention) – just 10 more minutes – **NOTE: you could skip this step if pressed for time, it’ll still taste good
Heated ghee on medium/high the stove in my dutch oven (this can be done in a skillet if you’re making this dish in a crock pot) – 2 minutes
Added garlic to the onions, continued cooking for about 3 more minutes, stirring often to avoid burning the garlic – 3 minutes
Cooking (time spent without touching the meal at all) – 3-10 hours, not that it really matters because you don’t have to touch it during that time 🙂
DUTCH OVEN: Cook at 350 for 2 to 3 hours, depending on how much you want your meat to just fall apart when touched 2-3 hours
EAT. If you want, you can add some kale to the pot for the last 15 or so minutes and it will end up steamed and sitting on top of everything else, making it easy to serve.
A fun little tip when doing dinner prep… I like to chop all vegetables first, then chop my meat. This allows me to continue using the same knife and cutting board throughout if I want to, without contaminating any veggies with raw meat before they should be combined.
So that’s it. Really just 10-20 minutes of actual time spent cooking. The rest is either in-oven, ignore time or plug-n-play, walk away time. I may actually write this recipe up at some point in the near future (hopefully later tonight or tomorrow). If I do, I will certainly update this post with a link to the recipe!
This isn’t a crazy complicated recipe or anything, but I need apple sauce for the Whole30 recipe I’m making for dinner tonight and I don’t have any. It’s also super hard to find it without added sugar!!
So.. Apples. In a pan. With water. Simmer. Stir. Add 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp allspice. Simmer. Mash. Done and done. Don’t waste time at the grocery store searching for that one brand that doesn’t add unnecessary sugar. Use the apples you have (even bruised ones) and make your own apple sauce. I personally don’t like to put mine in a blender or food processor because I like it to have a little chi lines to it. But that’s literally how I make my apple sauce these days:)
Eating healthy on a budget can be difficult sometimes (or all the time). Fast food restaurants all have the dollar menu… the produce section (very unfortunately) does not. We’ve been doing Whole30 for about 3 weeks now and the list of food we can eat is pretty long, Whole30 even has a shopping list to help us all out, but it’s all healthy and fresh (yay healthy!)… therefore it’s more expensive (frustrating). However, there are a few things we can all do to make healthy eating cheaper.
Aim to purchase vegetables that are in season. If food isn’t in season, the price goes up… you know, because there isn’t as much of a supply when it’s not currently being harvested. Some fruits and vegetables can be very easily canned and stored for use during their off season which can give you more choices later in the year without having to spend more on the same item. Canning fruits and vegetables can save quite a bit of money. Especially if you shop at your local farmer’s market and buy the “ugly fruit” – you know, the peaches that don’t look perfect, yet they’re perfectly edible? Yeah, buy those. They’re fine, and you can cut them up, can them, and have awesome peaches all winter long!
I also use two apps on my phone that help me earn money when I go grocery shopping… I’m sure there are a lot more, but these are the two I use:
Ibotta – Ibotta is a great app. You just unlock rebates and go shopping! It allows you to link your store loyalty card for some stores so you don’t have to upload a receipt. I’ve also seen some “any brand” rebates for things like eggs or bacon, both of which are allowed (bacon only if it doesn’t contain sugars) on Whole30 (the diet program I’m currently on). Ibotta also tends to have a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables on the rebate list, which is fantastic since we’re eating a lot of those!
SavingStar – SavingStar has at least one healthy offer of the week. It’s usually a fruit or vegetable. Pick the item, go shopping, upload your receipt, DONE. You can also link some of your store loyalty cards to this app, making it a no-brainer!
The great thing about these apps is that they give you either a set amount (maybe 20 cents, sometimes more, sometimes less) per item on your list. So if you manage to find a coupon for healthy food (it’s hard but occasionally I find one for eggs or bacon), then you can use the coupon at the store and you’ll get the rebate for the item through the app. It’s a total win-win!
I know there are other ways to eat healthy without breaking the bank, but these are the ones (along with coupons when I can find them for fresh fruit and veggies) are the ones I use. It does help, and it’s awesome to get a little extra money every once in a while for doing almost nothing!
All the things kitchen! Or at least all the kitchen essentials that I need, haha. I quite obviously did not include things like skillets, pots, or baking sheets. If you have a kitchen (which I am guessing you do), you probably already have those items on hand. Pots, pans, and baking sheets are really all about personal preference and I can’t vouch for one brand over another as I have several different brands of each in my cupboards!
This Totally Bamboo 5-Piece Utensil Set is a great deal and it’s what I have at home. I actually have 2 of the sets and then a few extras of just the spoons. There’s something about the thick, kind of flat handle that I really like. I think for me it’s because I tend to leave spoons near (let’s be real, often IN) a pot while I putz around the kitchen doing other things. The thicker handles don’t get as hot as fast as thinner ones. That’s why I really like these types of spoons, haha. I do love spoons and these ones are awesome!
I actually bought this Lodge Enameled Cast Iron Dutch Oven about 3 weeks ago. So far, I don’t see any staining on the inside enamel which is good. I would be insanely annoyed if the dutch oven got stained quickly. Several of the recipes in The Whole30 cook book utilize a dutch oven. I have also found that many can be replicated in a crock pot… and using a crock pot means you don’t have flip the meat or do anything as often. Either way works.
Hubby and I were actually given this exact set of Calphalon Knives for our wedding. I am not really the best at sharpening knives (quite unfortunate fact), but they’ve held up great and because I actually own them, I can tell you they’re good. I’m sure there are massively more expensive sets (and way cheaper ones) out there, and it’s really just personal preference and what works for you. But I use most of the knives in the set every day or 2 cooking on Whole30.
Must have all the mixing bowls! Honestly, I have so many mixing bowls, it’s not even funny. I use them for just about everything and having lots of different size options and extras of the smaller ones makes prepping super easy. I have one set like this Cook N Home Mixing Bowl Set that has lids, which I love. I most certainly don’t needs lids for all my mixing bowls (geez, where would I even put them?!), but having a few bowls with lids is great for prepping the night before… especially a crock pot meal that will all be thrown together in the morning 🙂
This is the exact blender I have. It’s called the Osterizer which I find rather amusing, lol. This is probably not the most amazing blender on the market, but I’ve had it for years, it still works, it’s easy to clean, and it mixes mayo like a champ! Like I’ve said before, we don’t eat much of the mayo, but it’s the first step to making the Whole30 ranch recipe, and our family loves some ranch! I think if the family had their way, ever single meal would somehow involve the inclusion of ranch dip or dressing.
Ok, so this isn’t the grater I have, but it’s really close. Looks like maybe the KitchenAid Grater has gotten a bit of an upgrade since I got mine. I like the slicer on the side of this one… now I’m jealous. This one’s cooler than mine! Anyway, it’s a super important part of our Whole30 experience, as we (or at least hubby) have sweet potato hash browns with breakfast every day!
This is the kind of cutting board I have. It’s a Dexas 6-Inch by 10-Inch Red Jelli Bar Board and there are other sizes too. I think you can buy them at Target too, but I honestly can’t remember because I’ve had them for a long time, haha. I also have a wooden cutting board, but it’s big a bulky. In my personal opinion, there is no such thing as too many cutting boards!
I keep a variety of mason jars on hand all the time. I have some 4oz Ball Mason Jars that I use for small amount of leftover sauce, extra coconut cream, etc. I have some 8oz Ball Canning Jars that I generally use for storing my clarified butter, jarring applesauce (yes, I can stuff) and keeping carrot sticks and other things in. And then I also have some 16oz Ball Mason Jars that I use for large amounts of dressings, like when I make a big batch of mayo or something, and I use them for canning carrots and other things throughout the year.
Adding this is an UPDATE to our Kitchen Essentials. This gadget is now my NEW FAVORITE THING! It’s called the Oster 2-Speed Hand Blender with Cup and the thing is AWESOME! My model is red, which is pretty cool, but it’s the same thing and I definitely do NOT want to be without it now! I have never made mayo so quickly before I used this! And thankfully, it’s not all that expensive, so I can get a new one if mine breaks 🙂
And of course, there’s The Whole30 book, something that I use on a daily basis, usually more than once. The book that is guiding my cooking and making it so that what I cook is no longer the same boring and bland junk I’ve been cooking for years. I’m not even sure you can call what I was doing in the kitchen before “cooking” really, as nothing ever tasted all that good, hahaha!
I can make the assumption (safely, I believe) that I have missed some things. If I think of anything else, I will add it here or mention it elsewhere on the site. I believe that having the right kitchen essentials and having enough of certain things is important when it comes to how easy and quick you can get through cooking a meal. Eliminating the need to wash your one and only cutting board every time you swap from meat to vegetables can save valuable time. Given how busy we all are these days, time savers are a must!
That question was recently posed to me by a family member. Why make it when I can just buy it? Well, I looked up some pricing online, to get a general idea, ounce for ounce, of the pricing of ghee versus butter. What I found from Walmart was that butter costs about $0.18 per ounce. Ghee, on the other hand, is a whopping $1.13 per ounce (again, at Walmart)! That is a huge price difference and one that I am not willing to pay.
Yes, making clarified butter can take a while, especially when I do it because I tend to make a lot all at once. The stuff is good for about 3 months left out on the counter and about 6 months in the fridge. So when I make it, it just makes sense to get a whole lot of it done all at once. Not to mention that running out of clarified butter would be a nightmare for us on Whole30!
To make clarified butter, I simmer the butter on the stove until everything separates and I can scoop the junk off the top and/or bottom of the pan. I then strain the remaining liquid through a coffee filter or cheesecloth and I am left with see-through yellow clarified butter. I then pour it into small mason jars and leave it on the counter to harden up some. Once hardened, I usually leave one out on the counter for use right away and put the rest in the fridge.
If, however, you simply don’t have time to make clarified butter or you just don’t want to (sometimes I don’t want to!!) you can buy Purity Farm Organic Ghee, Clarified Butter, 13-Ounce for just $10.99 – $0.85 an ounce… still more expensive than making it yourself, but not as expensive as Walmart and if there’s no time, it’s worth it!
The Whole30 website also has a good read about better butter, and whole9life.com has a butter manifesto that was interesting to read.
I am so excited to be apart of the worship team this Mother's Day morning. Really. Like SUPER excited. That may see strange for those of you who know me ... and know that I've been leading worship at my home church longer than some of my team members have been alive.
God keeps renewing my passion and zeal for bringing others into His presence. I live for worship - it's in my DNA ... it makes me complete. I was - we all were - created to worship Him. There is no other place, no other thing, that could replace the joy from doing just that.
I recently had an experience where a past friend came to a Sunday morning service, someone who had never been before. I happened to be leading that morning, and they were lovely and complimentary when they spoke with me later on. But fast forward a bit - through a different conversation - it was said that they wouldn't return because, "if they wanted to see a rock show - they would rather pay for it."
My BIGGEST fear in worship services, is trying to balance excellence and anointing. Everyone who is up on stage, wants to do their best. We meet the Thursday evening before the service, we rehearse and talk and support each other. We arrive and set up by 8am on a Sunday morning, often staying until 12:30pm for the end of the second service. They are dedicated and want to to their best. And they NEED to ... we require it of them. Mistakes can be distracting and disastrous. BUT. As soon as it's perceived that it's a performance - then something must change.
But let me say this as well: I cannot change the hearts of others. Only God can, when they LET him. No worship service will please everyone ... there are always the critics and I know that.
But - for those of us who are leading together, I think it all comes back to our hearts. Repenting of control, of ego, of self-awareness. I find myself already in a state of constant, "Lord - take me OUT of this equation. Put Yourself in it." It's a freeing place to be - where my lack of ability is made up with His incredible love and mercy.
This Sunday, I'm doing a "new" song. It's not really new - but I've been hesitant to do it because on the album ... well, it's spectacular. Musically, vocally, technically - spectacular. But our worship isn't a show - it's different than an album. But as I've waited for the right time to do this song, I go over the words again and again ... and I know that this is the time to do it ::
May we all check our hearts as we enter corporate worship this Sunday, wherever you may be - wherever you worship. That your participation isn't based on anything but Your desire to engage with the Creator. That spectatorship, that emotionalism, that anything OTHER than pure worship would be swept away from our hearts. I pray that He will meet you - that your faith would be made stronger in the presence of your Saviour.
Bravo and encore!! ..oh wait, those are performance terms.. I'm right in the same place you are friend!! ..and I'm going to add that comment to my list if "confounded compliments" ..one that someone told me a while back was "wow, worship was GREAT today!" and I replied with "thank you" and the answered "ya, it wasn't all about the music like it usually is" ..and I was like "wait, what?!" (sigh)

Toward the end of the 19th century the growing metropolitan area’s demand for water was outgrowing its existing water delivery system. The pumps that were used to send water through the City created dangerous surges in water pressure. To equalize that pressure a standpipe measuring five feet wide by 100 feet tall was built. But while this satisfied the functional needs of the system, it did nothing to satisfy the need for beauty and architectural ornamentation of the era. Thus the Tower was erected in 1898 to camouflage the standpipe.
The Tower was built in a French Romanesque style of rusticated limestone, buff brick and terra cotta on its face. On the base are a griffin and vine-like scrolls. Inside, 198 iron steps spiral around the standpipe, ending in an observation deck where visitors can enjoy a 360-degree view of the City.
As the city continued to develop other options for water service were built and by 1929 the Compton Hill Tower was no longer needed and was retired. By this time it had hosted thousands of people who came to see it, to make the climb to the top and to just enjoy the beautifully landscaped park. It was a great favorite during the 1904 World’s Fair. The Tower was occasionally opened so visitors could once again make the climb to the top but had to be closed to the public in 1984 when it was discovered that asbestos surrounded part of the tank on the Tower’s interior. For more than ten years the Water Tower stood untouched and began to deteriorate badly. Large cracks were forming, windows were missing or broken, and the terra cotta roof needed repairs. Architectural detail on walls had weathered away. In 1995 the City was faced with the possibility of demolishing the Tower. Residents and neighborhood associations in the areas around the Tower immediately raised an outcry and offered to work with the City in repairing and maintaining the structure. Their voices were heard.
In 1999, the completion of a $19 million renovation was celebrated with a festival that included food, music, entertainment and tours of the Tower. Since then, under the stewardship of members of the Water Tower & Park Preservation Society, Inc., the Tower has been open several times for neighborhood celebrations. The Society currently includes over 125 friends and supporters and is led by a volunteer Board of Directors that works closely with the Water Division to continue to preserve and improve the Tower and its surroundings. Currently the Society is working on a long-term master plan that will recreate the historical landscape design of the park, restore its original ponds and fountains, develop space allocated for large gatherings renovate the historic landscape, restore the park’s public restrooms and amend the park’s accessibility. The Society welcomes new members. If you are interested, please click here for more information. Your help is always welcome in the efforts to ensure that future generations will continue to have this beautiful and historic monument to enjoy.
For exactly a century now, an enormous statue of a nude woman has startled unwary visitors to Compton Hill Reservoir Park. Even though the statue and its pink granite frame are clearly visible from Grand Avenue, one of the city’s major thoroughfares, few passersby seem to notice it, and even those who have recognized it may not be familiar with its commemorative intentions or with the controversy that surrounded its creation…

In addition to recapping units 1, 2 and 4 (you may wish to do some past papers), try and pick up at least one extra fact not in the course related to each unit 5 topic - you'll need it to maximise your chances in the essay!
Flick forward to the essay titles and look at them. If you think you'll panic more doing this, then don't, but it can be helpful to keep the titles in the back of your mind as some of the questions in the bulk of the paper may have information useful to the essay itself.
Don't stress yourself over the essay; the UMS boundaries are almost always low for biology unit 5 (I saw one year where you could pretty much flunk the essay completely and walk away with 90% UMS)
Stop the question you're on and move onto the essay. If you're blundering through those really hard later questions, you're probably not going to get many (if any) marks and are certainly going to get less marks for your time than if you started the essay
PICK THE TITLE WISELY. If you can't decide in the split second which one you know more about, pick the one that sounds broader, as it'll probably have more scope for you to cram in extra topics if need be.
MAKE A PLAN. Most, if not all, candidates who got the A's and A*'s made some sort of plan. Even if you're not aiming that high, it goes to show how a plan can boost you up. Examiners will look at your plan if your essay is unfinished. It should be a spider-like diagram with the topics you're going to cover coming off of the centre bubble, and overviews of the finer points you're going to make coming off of those. Examiners can give breadth / scientific content marks for stuff in your plan that's not in your essay.

· Nahoko Uehashi from Japan. Uehashi tells stories that are replete with imagination, culture and the beauty of a sophisticated process and form. Her literary subjects are based on ancient Japanese mythology and science-fiction fantasy that are deeply rooted in human reality.
· Renate Welsh from Austria. Welsh focuses on children’s social reality therefore enabling them to cope with their own lives. Family crisis and social injustice, illnesses, social exclusion, violence at home and at school, isolation and identity conflicts are depicted with remarkable honesty.
· Jacqueline Woodson from the USA. Woodson often features African-American characters in her books because she feels strongly that children need to see themselves reflected in books. Each book she writes is a new experience, a way to learn something new or engage with a different subject that matters to her.

"The law from 1980 which covers all these payments. You pay for the law. The minimum you can pay is is 7.34 eu. Unbelievable !!!"
My views / opinions regarding the current governance of Canada. A little left leaning, I am definitely pissed off with our present government. Let's start a conversation about alternatives to bring this country back to Canadians, and away from control by big business and the 1 %.
Capitalism has perverted our democracy. Too much power has been ceded to the rich. Lobbyists run the country instead of the politicians we elect. Our rights are sold out to powers outside Canada.
Our government follows the Bilderberg Group (Too many Canadian politicians have attended their meetings) who propose a world government ruled of course by the rich. Why this is not treason escapes me.
The rich have lobbied their way to lower taxes than you and I pay. They now insist we lower the safety net we as Canadians have built through years of hard work. The rich believe their contributions to be of greater worth than our labour. I disagree. Why is money (interest & stocks) taxed at a lower rate than labour?
You want fair taxation? We need to drop all the special deductions and exceptions from the tax code.
Only a completely open, progressive tax system will provide the tax base required to relieve the debt burden presently crippling our economy.
Given all the taxes imposed on us in Canada, federal, provincial, gas, liquor, property taxes & HST, most of us are paying close to or over 50% of our initial incomes. Don't forget to add in your costs for health care (free health care right?), bogus environmental charges, license fees, excise taxes, EI & CPP.
Given the above I have to wonder where all the money is. If everyone is paying that much there is no way we should be in a deficit situation! So who is not paying their share? I know I have, throughout my working life. Now in retirement, all I see is the government trying to reduce my pension, increase my taxes and reduce our benefits.
I'm no economist (thank god) so I don't claim to have all the answers, but I do think there are ways and means for Canada to continue to allow for the safety net we pride ourselves in providing the less fortunate in our society.

Presettlementfunding.com is around the nation's top settlement financing collaborations, and a trusted pioneer in regards to helping affronted social events who are obliging settlement of pending claims, allowing them to progression without money related burdens.
Pre settlement supporting is an enormously old thought - families and sidekicks have been "fronting" or offering credits to friends and family who are holding up for a case to pay - this has continued for an astounding while.

Given the costs incorporated in pre settlement financing, it is critical for hurt people to consider any open alternatives. This sort of financing should just usually be the last resort. The charges are begun upon the risk to the moneylender associated with non-arrange of movement advancing, yet recall that these associations pick their cases meticulously with a particular final objective to minimize dangers, and gave that they offer you an improvement they acknowledge that you will get money from your case. Gave that you decide to secure pre settlement sponsoring you should just check with a few associations, in order to get the most incredible terms.
Examine this. Different individuals wind up in the event that circumstances in light of the rashness or carelessness of others, on the off chance that they be begun by an individual, a cooperation or an expansive association. Spasmodically, the offended assembling is harmed and can not work or secure cash all around this process. They're pushing over how to pay the bills while they sit tight for the case to settle. Gave that the prosecutors, or their security orgs, drag this out, the mischief amassing can wind up in an astoundingly testing circumstance. Out of stores until the case is settled, they are in a split second in a phenomenally delicate position. Usually they are pushed to take an "unanticipated" settlement, which could be a minor package of what it may as well simply have been, and all in light of the fact that they didn't have the cash to get them through to a sensible and just settlement.
One thing you have to understand in the area of a case pre settlement improvement is that it really isn't a credit whatsoever. It's earnestly avowed a non-organize of development responsibility, a non-response duty is fundamentally a secured advancement subordinate upon affirmation. With a settlement credit your security is your pending claim and the conceivable future budgetary reward. Not in any avenue like common credits you won't have to have your credit checked, have a particular term of work or a particular pay level. The variable in picking needing that you get a case advancement is subordinate upon.

ELKHART — Anabaptist Mennonite Biblical Seminary has received a $1 million grant to help establish “Thriving on the Journey: A Process for Pastoral Leaders.”
The grant is part of Lilly Endowment's Thriving in Ministry, an initiative that supports a variety of religious organizations across the nation as they create or strengthen programs that help pastors build relationships with experienced clergy who can serve as mentors and guide them through key leadership challenges in congregational ministry, according to a news release from AMBS.
Lilly Endowment has approved nearly $70 million in grants through the Thriving in Ministry initiative.
According to Jewel Gingerich Longenecker, AMBS dean of lifelong learning, the AMBS Thriving on the Journey program comprises two components:
• Transition to Leadership supports pastors as they transition into ministry; it is designed to guide new pastors over a period of two years as they move into a ministry role following completion of a master of divinity degree.
• Leadership integrity circles will address ministry transitions brought on by personal, relational, cultural or structural upheaval specific to particular ministry settings. This component is designed to guide experienced pastors as they seek to reimagine their ministries in light of these shifts.
“Transition to Leadership will use and expand upon what we have learned about mentoring from our noncredit Journey Missional Leadership Development program, offered through the Church Leadership Center since 2003,” Gingerich Longenecker said. “Leadership integrity circles will draw on what we have learned through our Ministry in Church and World internship courses in the master of divinity program.
“Both programs will empower pastoral leaders to re-imagine their calls and ministries so that they can lead their congregations confidently, joyfully and non-anxiously in ministries of reconciliation suited to their contexts — developing self-awareness, curiosity and intercultural competence; developing relationships of support; and experiencing clarity in their roles,” she said.
Sara Wenger Shenk, AMBS president, said she’s thrilled with Lilly Endowment’s strong endorsement of the quality leadership formation that the seminary’s CLC has been offering to the church.
“These new initiatives build on a strong foundation of established relationships, proven methodologies, and innovative programming that is a signature of the CLC, Jewel Gingerich Longenecker’s leadership and our AMBS faculty,” she said. “I’m especially encouraged that the mentoring and guidance envisioned for both new and experienced leaders will particularly emphasize growth in intercultural competence and ministries of reconciliation — skills urgently needed by faith leaders in our time. We offer our hearty thanks to Lilly Endowment for its leadership and affirmation of AMBS’s programming, yet again, building on earlier grants.”
AMBS is one of 78 organizations located in 29 states that is taking part in the initiative. The organizations reflect diverse Christian traditions: mainline and evangelical Protestant, Roman Catholic and Orthodox.
Thriving in Ministry is part of Lilly Endowment’s grant-making to strengthen pastoral leadership in Christian congregations in the United States. This has been a grant-making priority at Lilly Endowment for nearly 25 years.
“Leading a congregation today is multi-faceted and exceptionally demanding,” said Christopher L. Coble, Lilly Endowment’s vice president for religion. “When pastors have opportunities to build meaningful relationships with experienced colleagues, they are able to negotiate the challenges of ministry and their leadership thrives. These promising programs, including AMBS’s Thriving on the Journey, will help pastors develop these kinds of relationships, especially when they are in the midst of significant professional transitions.”

Shirley Ann Phelps Bruso, Passed away on January 23rd 2008 in Puyallup Washington. Shirley was born in North Adams Massachusetts a town that she loved dearly. Proceeded in death by her husband Walter Edward Bruso, sisters Nancy Eva Phelps Hunt, Ruth Jean Phelps Gardzina, Brother, Clifton Homer Phelps and parents Clifton Homer Phelps Sr. and Ruth Arnott Hyde. Her children Susan Ruth Bruso Campbell (Ken Campbell), Wayne Peter Bruso, Walter Edward Bruso Jr., Mary Ellen Bruso Aguayo (Emilio Aguayo), James Alan Bruso, and grand children: David Campbell, Brian Campbell (Heather R), Jason Campbell, Erlinda Aguayo Siwulec (Chris Siwulec), Chacoy Aguayo, Emilio Jr. Aguayo, Joseph Aguayo, Anthony, Savannah, Dawn, Christopher, Todd Valentine (Brionne) and great grand children Tyler Campbell, Braden Campbell, Tyse Aguayo, Latisha, Esperansa, Isabel, Emma, Lorena, Carson Siwulec, Cameron Abby Siwulec, Orion Valentine survive her. Shirley was a wonderful wife, mother, grandmother, great grandmother and friend. Shirley will be missed by all that know her, she was the kind of person that would do anything for her friends and family and is an inspiration/role model for many people. Shirley was an avid genealogist a hobby that she loved to do. Shirley was also an avid Webmaster logging many hours on the computer often times in the wee hours of the morning working on her pages as she called them, sharing her knowledge, photographs, post cards and genealogy information on the web. There are no services planned and the family wishes in lieu of Cards and Flowers for you to make a donation to a charity of your choice in Shirley's honor.
The Summit was about 2,000 feet above sea level and on the Jacob's Ladder Trail (or Roadway)(Route 20), West Becket, between Chester and Lee, Massachusetts. Work on the Jacob's Ladder Roadway had started about 1905 and was completed in 1910. Before that the road was almost impossible to negotiate by automobile. It was said that the dirt road looked like a ladder as there were rows of dirt going across the road to stop the rain from washing it out and on the sides of the road were clearings for horses and oxen to rest. Hence the name Jacob's Ladder. To mark the Summit a cairn or rock pile was erected during the celebration to dedicate the road, to some an historical marker. Sadly, it has been painted over with an ugly brown paint and it's meaning destroyed. The roadway was rebuilt in 1918 and again in 1930 and many cars took this route across the state to Albany,NY.

I hope I have managed to capture the emotional serenity in this picture. Both sisters gaze lovingly at the new addition to our family.
One the mother, the other the auntie - each one lost in their own thoughts and feelings towards little Eden Rose.
One holding her head, the other cradling Eden in her arms; two sisters united in the miracle of birth.
"The world is a stage and all the people merely players". Since hearing that quote I have lived my life by it, believing it, and qualifying my life by it. It is impossible for me to sit still for more than a few minutes unless I am doing something ie: working on my laptop, writing, painting or something else equally creative. It drives my nearest and dearest crazy because they think I am incapable of relaxing. They do not realise that being creative in any genre is how I relax and that I get enormous cathartic therapy by doing so. To sit in a chair may well rest my body but my mind is constantly active and I feel the best way to satisfy my need for stimulation is to be creatively active. I have written poetry and verse for many years, either in the form of lyrics or poems. Many times I have found this to be theraputic in times of stress and anxiety. The same must be said for my art sessions. We all need a "let out clause" - creativity is mine. Submit Blog Directory

I am on a quest. It's a quest of the taboo kind and I won't leave any place unsearched and no stone unturned. I'm Rafe, and I have made it my goal to travel Asia in search of hot ladyboy to fill with my cock and get them on film stroking their she rods and squirting their cumloads in ecstasy. I am a true lover of these exotic and erotic beauties and you can join me for a walk on the wild side as I search, find and fuck as many shemales hotties as Asia has to offer.
Let Rafe show you a side of Asia you have never seen. This true shemale lover travels the countryside, the cities and towns leaving no where untried. He searches for delicious ladyboys willing to swallow his meaty dick and take his cock in their tight bungholes as they stroke their shecocks until they are spewing their cumloads in pleasure. And Rafe gets it all on camera so you can enjoy every minute of the hot butt fucking, shecock pumping action!

There is no beginning or ending in it, just the desire to learn and drink fresh flowing music from the greatest musical source in the history of the bamboo flute Maestro Hariprasad Chaurasia
Actually to none. But Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj does belong to India and to all Indians, whatever their religion or ethnic origin, for he is an eternal icon of courage, statesmanship, love for his country, able and honest administration. In fact, the qualities that he embodied, are those that a modern Indian politician should possess, but unfortunately, seldom has. Shivaji was a man for all India: he travelled, thought about, and warred in all parts of India, from Agra, then capital of the Mughal empire to Gingee, all the way down in the South. He was the first one who understood that India needed a navy if it wanted to control its waters – and he did build a formidable one.
Yet, try to look for a biography of Shivaji in any bookshop in India : it is practically impossible to find one, as many have gone out of print. Most of these biographies, except, the one from James Lane, which has all the hostile flaws of western, date back to twenty to thirty years. Now, in my country, France, we have such a hero in Napoleon. All children are schooled into Napoleon’s great deeds right from kinder garden. Like Shivaji, Napoleon was not only a great warrior, but also a statesman of exceptional vision: some of the laws and codes he devised, are still in practice today. Thus, most French people are proud of Napoleon – and rightly so – because he was, like Shivaji, great warrior, a visionary and an exceptional statesman. Therefore, every year, at least four to five new books are written, directly or indirectly, about Napoleon, his life or his deeds.
Compare this with India, where not only it is difficult to find a book about Shivaji, but where last year, the Kerala Government put a ban on school notebooks which carried pictures of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj…. This is wrong. No nation can move forward unless it has heroes. No country can progress unless it is proud of itself and can make its children relate to heroes seeped in one’s culture. But it is not so in India. This is not jingoism, but nationalism. Yet every time you open an Indian newspaper or switch on a TV channel, the impression you get is that everything is rotten in India, nothing works and that Indians are the most corrupt and inefficient people in the world.
