On July 23, 1996, Jones was arrested for possession of marijuana after police raided the Teaneck, New Jersey home of Wallace.

The following year, they were featured in the Hot 97 NY Fashion Show,[159] and additionally appeared on the covers of The Source and Vibe.[160][161] However, their first dispute developed after both of their debut studio albums were scheduled for release a week apart in November 1996.[160] Media outlets additionally noted similarities between the sleeve covers of Lil' Kim' Hard Core and Brown's Ill Na Na, where the two were shown wearing the same outfit.[162] In 1997, the feud led to the deterioration of their friendship, and also resulted in the cancellation of a collaborative album Thelma & Louise.

In January 1999, critics noted the track "My Life" from Brown's second studio effort Chyna Doll for being an "open appeal" to Brown's friendship with Lil' Kim, in which she cited the relationship being "lost for pride", but also contradicted herself after making attacks on "pointed mistresses".[165][166][167] Critics indicated the records were in subtle use to diss Lil' Kim, especially since during this time, Brown had been supporting Lil' Kim' rival Faith Evans in multiple interviews.[166] In February 1999, a significant part of the media took note of Brown "suddenly sound[ing] 'exactly' like Lil' Kim".[168] In late May 1999, Lil' Cease's "Play Around", featuring Lil' Kim and Diddy, was released to radio airwaves and was set to be featured on Cease's debut The Wonderful World of Cease A Leo.[160] In the song, after Lil' Kim' guest rap, Diddy recites: "Stop trying to sound like her too bitches"; a subliminal diss aimed at Foxy.[160] The line spurred enough controversy that various media sources went on to remark: "It's finally coming out. Foxy Brown bites worse than a pit bull."[169] Additionally, Lil' Kim' guest appearance on Mobb Deep's "Quiet Storm (Remix)" and her second album's title track, "The Notorious K.I.M.", were released as diss records to Foxy Brown.[160] Angered by Lil' Kim' response, Brown collaborated with longtime associates Capone-N-Noreaga on the track, "Bang, Bang."[160] In the track, Brown mimicked Lil' Kim' interpolation of MC Lyte's "10% Dis," and went on to recite: "You and Diddy y'all kill me with that subliminal shit."[160] Towards the ending of her verse, Brown attacked Lil' Kim' grieving for the loss of Biggie Smalls by remarking: "Let the nigga [Biggie] rest in peace, and hop off his dick, bitch do you."[160][170]
On February 26, 2001, at 3 p.m., when Lil' Kim had left New York radio station Hot 97, a shooting broke out; over twenty shots were fired between two groups of three men.[171][172] One of the men in the groups was Capone, one-half member of Capone-N-Noreaga, who was entering the Hot 97 building in promotion of interviewer DJ Clue's new album, The Professional 2, which happened to have also featured Lil' Kim.[173] An affiliate, Efrain Ocasio, from Capone's entourage was shot in the back; both parties from Lil' Kim and Capone denied any involvement in the shooting.[173] However, a motive behind the shooting was later determined; detectives informed The New York Daily News that it was a result of the verses Foxy Brown recited in "Bang, Bang."[173]
Shaken up by the incident, Brown tried to reach out to Lil' Kim in hopes of settling a truce.[174] Brown stated, "I really don't know how it started. But Russell [Simmons] and I, we got together, and I said, 'Russell, I want to call a truce.' I want to have a sit-down with Kim. I don't care what it is. Let's just end it. We can even do a collaboration. We're bigger than this. If it has to start with me, let it start with me."[174] Brown even extended an olive branch to Lil' Kim' camp, however Lil' Kim had cut all ties with Diddy and Bad Boy associates and wanted no communication with Brown whatsoever.[174] On July 6, 2005, Lil' Kim was sentenced to prison for three counts of perjury and one count of conspiracy.[175]
During the 4-year span leading up to Lil' Kim's sentencing, Brown and Lil' Kim began to exchange subtle diss records towards each other, among them included Lil' Kim' La Bella Mafia,[176][177] "Quiet",[178] and "Guess Who's Back";[179] and in turn, Brown's Ill Na Na 2: The Fever and various mixtape freestyles.[180][181] In the midst of the diss records, Brown was interviewed by Doug Banks in 2003 to disclose any further details pertaining to her dispute with Lil' Kim.[182] Brown claimed that Lil' Kim was allegedly jealous that Biggie was to include Brown in his Junior Mafia collective.[182] Brown also added that a tell-all book disclosing the feud would be released in Christmas of 2003.[182] In her final regards to the dispute, Brown stated: "Kim is the only female artist that keeps me on my toes. She's the only one that I can look at; and any other artist that says they don't have that one person that keeps them driven... is lying."[182]
Following her release from prison, Lil' Kim no longer acknowledged Brown. Brown, on the other hand, has consistently targeted Lil' Kim as a prime basis in her music and concert venues since Lil' Kim' prison release.[183][184][185][186][187][188][189]
On May 17, 2012, Lil' Kim attended an interview with radio show, The Breakfast Club.[190] When asked about whether or not she had spoken to Brown at all in recent years, Lil' Kim replied, "I don't even know her. And when I say that; I don't know who she is to these days. I wouldn't even know what her voice sounds like."[190]
Lil' Kim has been embroiled in a feud with rapper Nicki Minaj since Minaj dissed Lil' Kim in a track titled "Hoodstars", which was released in 2003. With Lil' Kim and media critics noticing resemblances with her on the Sucka Free mixtape,[191] Lil' Kim accused Minaj of copying her image saying, "If you are going to steal my swag, you gonna have to pay. Something gotta give. You help me, I help you. That's how it goes to me."[191] Minaj's single "Roman's Revenge" with Eminem was believed by critics to be a response to Lil' Kim's comments,[192] although she later denied this,[193] she responded to the situation in an interview on The Angie Martinez show saying "She picked a fight with Foxy, then she picked a fight with Eve, then she picked a fight with Remy, then it was Mrs. Wallace, then it was Nicki Minaj", said Minaj. "Every time you in the news, it's 'cause you gettin' at somebody! Where's your music? Put your music out, and when I see your name on Billboard, that's when I'll respond to you. Other than that, goodbye. It's Barbie, bitch."[194]
Lil' Kim reignited the feud following the release of her mixtape Black Friday, an album that directly referenced Nicki Minaj, via her debut album title and songs such as "Did It On'em" (that became "Pissin' On'em"); and with artwork that showed Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword.[195] A fragment of Minaj's diss track "Tragedy" was released online in April 2011, featuring lyrics "Pink Friday, Eminem, 8 Mile/ It must hurt to sell your album on PayPal."[196] Following the release of Minaj's second album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, critics suggested that the tracks "Stupid Hoe"[197] may have contained attacks at Lil' Kim. Lil' Kim later suggested in an interview with 105's Breakfast Club that the song "Automatic" from Minaj's second album was similar to her unreleased material, also calling Minaj "obnoxious" and "catty".[198]
Throughout her career, Lil' Kim has earned numerous honors and awards. Lil' Kim's debut album Hard Core was certified double platinum by the RIAA, and is considered a classic hip-hop album.[199][200] As of 2007, Lil' Kim has sold over 15 million albums worldwide. Her songs "No Time", "Big Momma Thang" and "Ladies Night" were listed on Complex Magazine's "The 50 Best Rap Songs By Women", at number 24, 13, and 7, respectively.[5] Her song "Lady Marmalade" with Pink, Christina Aguilera, and Mýa, is one of the best-selling singles of all time worldwide, with sales of over 5.1 million worldwide.[201] Lady Marmalade went number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, making her the first female rapper to have a number one on that chart. The song won a 2002 Grammy Award in the category of "Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals".
Lil' Kim was ranked as one of the top 50 greatest MCs of all time in Kool Moe Dee's 2003 book, There's a God on the Mic.[202] In 2012, Lil' Kim was honorably listed on VH1's "100 Greatest Women In Music" at number 45, making her the 4th highest position for a female-rapper.[203] In 2014, Lil' Kim was included in Billboard's list of the "31 Female Rappers Who Changed Hip-Hop".[204] In 2016, VH1 honored Lil' Kim with VH1 Hip-Hop Honors and WEEN Award honored Kim with Icon Award because of her contribution to Hip-Hop. In June 2018, Lil' Kim was honored with a proclamation by the New York City Council’s Black, Latino, and Asian Caucus (BLAC) as part of the annual African-American Music Appreciation Month for her contributions to hip-hop. Along with the proclamation, she also accepted the New York City 12th Council District Arts and Music Award and the city’s Power Of Influence Award.[205]
Aside from music, Lil' Kim is also known for her risk-taking and luxurious approach to fashion that inspired many artists; she has been cited as a fashion icon, as well as one of the most influential female rappers, by various media outlets.[8][9][12][13]

Attending conferences is part of grad school and of some careers. I've been to dozens of them, sometimes as a speaker, sometimes as an attendee, once as an organizer. Some of them were great, while I would have enjoyed others more if I had been better prepared. I learned from my mistakes and from my friends and have came up with my strategy to make the most out of the conferences I attend. I'd like to share it with you.
Conferences serve two purposes: learning (L) and networking (N). Let's optimize these with a few simple tricks.
Prepare your networking cards. (N) That's right, business people have business cards and there is no reason why you shouldn't have your own "business" cards for networking. Be sure to include your name and email address. Perhaps your LinkedIn contact info and a tagline describing your speciality would be nice to have, too.
Plan which talks you want to see. (L) Go through the conference program and note the talks you really don't want to miss, especially if it's a big multi-track conference. You'll thank yourself later.
Contact a few people beforehand. (N) I did this twice and it gave wonderful results. Simply reach out by email to two or three people (perhaps the speakers of the talks you really want to see?) and ask them to discuss their field of interest with you over coffee or at the poster session. I love this trick because instead of going in a room full of strangers at the conference, I will go in a room where two or three people I share interests with are waiting to meet me, which makes the experience a lot less overwhelming. Go the extra mile and read a paper or two written by the people you contacted to have a deeper discussion about what they do.
Turn off your laptop and your phone. (L) Humans are bad at multi-tasking. If you think you can take notes on your electronic device without checking your emails/Twitter, either you have a will of steel or you are fooling yourself.
Take notes. (L) Taking notes during talks allows to focus on what the presenter is saying (as opposed to let your mind wander) on top of being a handy reminder for later. I like to aim for at least 3 keywords per talk, but when it's really interesting, I can write many pages. I also take notes of whom I talked to and what we talked about.
Don't skip the poster session. (N+L) The poster session is a good place to discuss your field with people, which is way more engaging than listening to a talk. It's time to gather some intel for your own research and to make connections. It's the ultimate networking event, don't spend it watching TV in your hotel room. Bring your networking cards!
Be a stranger in your own town. (N) If the conference is held in your own city, it's easy to stay home late and skip the first session, go home early, continue your social life with your friends and so on. Try to enter the mindset of an out-of-town attendee : have breakfast at the conference (if they offer it), hang out late with people you met there, go explore the city with someone you met there, heck, be their guide to the local breweries and restaurants!
Lose the clique (N). If you are at the conference with your lab buddies and always stick together, you will lose many opportunities to meet interesting new people. Make it a point to split up or invite new people to hang out with you.
Follow up with you new contacts. (N) It's time to sort through all the networking cards you collected and add your new contacts to LinkedIn or send them an email to follow up on your conversation. You can also process them every night of the conference so you don't end up with one big pile at the end.
Read your notes and write a summary. (L) While the conference is still fresh in your head, it's time to go though your notes and write down some extra stuff. What was the highlight of the conference for you? Which new papers should you read? Have your opinion changed about something? Should you perform some actions?
Read the proceedings. (L) It's time to read the papers of those great talks that merit your attention.
I'm sure everybody have their own way of approaching a conference and there are a lot of other advices out there. Try some of them and let me know what works great for you!

Although some were shocked by a jury’s determination that concert promoters AEG Live was not negligent in the death of Michael Jackson, there was one person who felt vindicated: Dr. Conrad Murray.
The jailed doctor whose hiring by AEG was one of the centerpieces of Katherine Jackson’s wrongful death lawsuit against the promoters, spoke to “Today” host Matt Lauer Thursday morning and said, “My immediate reaction was one of tears; certainly, I cried.”
While the jury agreed that AEG hired Murray, they did not feel the doctor was unfit or incompetent to provide Jackson's medical care, despite claims by Katherine Jackson and three of her children.
Murray was pleased because some of the facts that were not allowed at his own trial were presented. The doctor explained, "I cried because for once the world was allowed to hear some of the facts... much of which I was denied and my attorneys could not present during my criminal trial. I was very relieved that at least the world had a chance of hearing some of the facts."
Murray was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death in 2011 and sentenced to four years in jail. He is filing an appeal in criminal court, and will be released from prison in a few weeks for good behavior and because of California prison overcrowding. He has served less than half of his sentence.
One juror told CBS News, “Dr. Murray was unethical. Had the word unethical been in there, it may have went the other way. He did something that he or no doctor should have done, but, again, he wasn't hired to do that. He was hired to be a general practitioner."
Murray countered, "What the juror said was that if ethics were the issue, the conclusion might be different. This is not about ethics. This was about the Jacksons bringing a lawsuit which I felt from the beginning was frivolous... When you say I am 'unethical,' that was speculation on (the juror's) part, because he has not heard the other side."
He says that when he leaves jail, he just wants to "embrace my children" and "reunite with my family and close friends."

OK, the preceding thread what I research the subject of Midbass Horns and Real Estate have finished with great success.
I found and got a house that I like very much and the house has a lot of good Midbass options. Even though the listening room does not sound at the level I would like it to be but I feel that it is normal. I did not work with room too hard as I am doing remodeling of house nowadays; you know how it works… The room will sound much better what I turn my full attention to it.
However, as I concluded in the room thread above the Macondo needs a help of extra Midbass channel – so, with all theoretical formal brainstorming the Midbass Project will we my very next audio project as soon I return to audio full time. I have made today an inventory of drivers that I might use for Midbass Project. I have a lot, perhaps 18 drives that I might choose from. I have a DSET that will be driving the channels. I have found a carpenter with skills and equipment who will be able to help me. I have a budgeted the project and have the carpenter agreement to work off this budget.
I started this thread as a dedicate recourse where I will be posting about the project’s thoughts, ideas, progress and results. Perhaps I started this thread to have an additional encouragement to actually start the project.
Probably the next month I will be assessing different option – where I will be building the Midbass channels, what kind it will be and how it will be integrated with room. Of cause it is not secret that the Midbass horns are at a very stop of my short list of option but I will evaluate all opportunities.
I always was dreaming about dedicated Midbass channels. I also have absolutely clear vision how I would like them to sound – in fact the exactness of this vision is even scares me. Went I listen my Macondo now I know absolutely precisely when and how the Midbass channel’s Sound shall be introduced. All that I need is juts to do it…

Very interesting to follow your project. I will be watching your progress from now on. Under the kind feelings you have (I know very well) about the sound you want to get from midbass I doubt you can fail in getting there.That is it.
Anyhow , midbass-upperbass is about the interesting audio range to design - think - and- build perhaps due to size of horn involved and "density and importance of sound" it must produce. Enjoy it .
This weekend if I have time I will be doing the testing of my driver deciding which one I will be using. The framework of testing will be the following: a single driver, closed at 150Hz first order, mounted in infinite baffle and working along with Macondo MF, and upperbass channels, no lower bass and not tweeters. I am sure that I will be able to select the best sounding and the most interestingly sounding diver among those that I have but how this “best sounding” will manifest it in the back chamber of perspective horns I have no idea. I am considering to load it to 8” buffle hole….
I set up today the framework in which I will be testing my Vitavox 15 inchers. It is a wooden frame from my bathtub with a driver screws to it, the massive sliding doors that squash the driver from both sides and cardboard that cover the wholes. This is a very rough parody to an infinite baffle configuration but I think for the purpose I meant to use it this configuration will work as I care about the difference in my drivers, not about the ultimate performance. I use external Marchant X26 crossover and drive it with a full range Melquiades. BTW, one of the full-range Melquiades blew up, literally with good size exposure in the belle of the beast. I thing one of the high voltage caps got burned. I do not have an audio working bench set up in my new home, so I will live it as is for now. I actually question if I would need audio working bench but it is another subject.
Romy, are these drivers going to wind up in the ceiling horns? I currently use 15" Audax PR380M2 paper drivers in conservatively-tuned BR bins, X/O'd 3rd order at ~ 125 Hz. I do this because I need the gain with my current amp set-up. These drivers are not really directional, but IMO they are petering out, tone-wise, at ~100 Hz. This frequency range pretty much splits the 12" and 15" drivers, IMO, but I plan to try the Stellavox 12" to fill that tonal gap. Below 100 Hz, the 15" is very nice, and it is not so much that it is "bad" above 100 Hz as it just trails off, if you know what I mean. Some of the bass guitar drivers have nice tone up to 400 or 500 Hz, or even more. Unfortunately, few of these do well below 55 or 60 Hz.
When i Moved in my new house in july 2000, it took me 6 months to get my speakers and general system togeather and working. The narrow band that your vitavox 15 inchers will be working in, how does that relate to your infinite baffle? 60Hz to 350Hz is the range that you seek so how does this test jig see 120Hz with out being loaded in the rear of it? I also notice that it is your right channel amp that is blown up with powersupply problems, then we wonder why the Lf is not working correct on that channel? Do you have good insurance? For a good doctor. Preaching Horn Religion MSAUDIO
I was trying the drivers in my infinite baffle parody configuration and I have to admit that that all of them sounded not good. There is not even a fraction of tone that am loosing and from any other quantifiable subjective point of view the driver did not show up themselves good. This test itself does not mean anything and I will discard the result. I do not want to go into the depth of T/S, loading , bass imperfection of Marchand XM26 crossover or the imperfection of sealing in order to prove anything to myself. I just declare the result as not conclusive and will forget about it.
You sound like you are not happy with your results from your parody? I am sure your got some info from this for next stage, that we will hear about in the future. Preaching Horn Religion MSAUDIO
If you do go ahead with horns, you should be able to make them so that they'll accept most any 15" driver, which means you could use the horns in making the decision on drivers.
If you go with some sort of direct radiating enclosure, then you'll likely have to decide on drivers ahead of time in order to get the volume of the box right for the driver.
About your experiment: Sort of a brilliant approach, but the improvised baffle and any wind outside may be eating up tone. You might consider buying a 4x8 sheet of 3/4" CDX plywood (cheap, rough, for exterior use), cut a hole in it, and use it in place of the improvised baffle (still placed in the sliding doors).
Alternatively, you might cut the plywood to fit exactly into an interior doorway (not the sliding glass doors), cut a hole in it, mount it so that it closes off the doorway to a room, then mount the driver. You could of course do the same with a cheap door, but they are hollow.
Later you can use the plywood for an instant, erect-as-needed audio work bench, supported on folding metal saw horses and a couple 2x4s studs; keep the round cutout as a trap door, it will come in handy.
Nope, it is not the question that I faced. I very much down that I go for any form of direct radiation. Most likely it will be a pair of horns but I am trying to forecast WHAT kind horn they might be and HOW they will interact with the room. Ironically I have multiple options. Yes, the midbass horns might be in front wall, in side walls, in back wall above (attic), from basement, and even stand-alone in the room. I need to select one direction that I will be attacking. I think it will take for me a month or so to figure the things out.
Looking that my attic place is very much triangle I am contemplating an experiment with triangular horn. The idea that lead me there was Balalaika. Balalaika is Russian 3-strings musical instruments that has unique sound. One of the attribute of the unique is that it is really loud. The reason is that the deck is triangular and opposite walls have no reflections. So, the sound entering the deck get infinitely reflected. Balalaika has own compressed and a bit “closed” sound but it wanted to be wide bandwidth – something that I do not need and against.
The guy is real good, and i would like to find some of his stuff on CD. Can you find his music in the states? Can you post some pictures of basement? PREACHING HORN RELIGION MSAUDIO
Never in my life have I heard a plywood horn of any description that was other than a resonator. So, although I cannot draw on my successes, I do have a long list of failures to go on, to add to my extensive experience as a builder. Based on my experience, it could be quite a trial to build and tune a plywood horn in the vaulted ceiling, and it's hard to imagine how it could be profitable for a craftsman to work for a fixed price, with "successful completion" tied to an opinion regarding the sonic results of the end-use horn.
Another area of difficulty facing the developer of horns like this is the fact that it will only be possible to evaluate the units in situ, along with the possible need to re-tune them as the rest of the system is developed around them.
How would one go about determining a starting point for the horn profiles? What sort of materials would one use that could be hung on the existing rafters?
I think if everything goes as I planed then this month I will start my Midbass Horn project. I thought to do it later but I am too sick and tired without my main playback – so, I would rather to do it sooner than later. At present time I am strategizing what it will be, of course the attic solution is leading all the way, no wonder as I was buying this house with this intend. If you look at the Page #8 of the Midbass Horns and Real Estate thread then you refresh the idea.
Here is how the “Triangular Wall” looks like – the horns will be on this wall (where the air-conditioning ducks now)…. In the time alight position, invisible in the room and now screwing the room decor- God, will I be able to do it – the dream of idiot might come through!!!
Later on this month I will have a framing specialist to inspect my attic and give me the numbers: how much space I will have. This will greatly determine what kind horn I will be building. Meanwhile the following question I am contemplating:
1) Each horn will be 2-4 sections, so where to slice it? If we presume that section would have own resonance then what would be a difference between 5-5-3 feet and 4-4-4 feet? Probably it would be a good idea to have all section of different length. However, why the different length but not the length mass of the each section? I think I will go for different length and different mass but I still will think about it. I would like one section to me master and the rest sections to be slaves - from resonant perspective. This will give a further control after the horn is built and installed. I still think how I would do it….
2) The wall’s type material. This is complicated. The leading idea is to use two layers of plywood of different thickness and to position the layers perpendicular. Then the question is: what guy to use? Then the question is if to bolt the layers. Perhaps not to bolt but to use the wood-made screws…
3) The material itself – what to use. I am wide open from any type of wood to synthetic panels (like cement panels). Perhaps it might be a combination of organic and synthetic layers.
5) Where to buy the material in bulk quantities? I have budget the cost of horns materials around $1000
The woofers need 2 be matched. What is the Resonance frequency of the cones of the woofers? You want to mount the woofers on front side of baffle or rear? Are you going 2 use dual 15 woofers on each side? Don't ruin your house by putting them in your attic. Cut out the baffle first, mount your drivers and do some tests with 1/2 OSB, it is about $8.00 a sheet. just build 1 as a jig so you can fine tune. Then after you have perfected your horn and it meets your guide line, then build a pair heavy duty. Preaching Horn Religion MSAUDIO
If I succeed to make my midbass horn at attic then I will face another problem that I do not know how to address at this point. The horns will be powered from Melquiades bass channels – it means it will use a good 70 feet speaker cable. If I go with Copper wire then it will have per foot:
Let presume that I will go for 12ga cable it means that I will have: 0. 00187 * 70 = 0.139R. This permanent impedance is a bit bothers me. It is not the impedance distributed in the secondary of the output transformer but it I impedance that voice coil get increased. This perm impedance only adds compression to the sound of driver. It is very possible that for my 16R driver the .1R will be negligible but who knows how much negligible is negligible. I am a bit afraid to go with thicker wire as it usually comes with less interesting upper bass – the sound feels like become “hollow”. Sure, it possible to get involved in the cabling wars then, and I am sure I will. What are the alternatives? To run a long line level interconnect and to put the amps on attic? To fire-dangers in my view… I was thinking to do it with fire sensor above the amps in attic and close circuit TV monitor but I kind of getting more complicated then I would like it to be…
May I at least ass-u-me that you plan to high pass these horns? If so, go ahead and figure that in, too. In any case, just looking at 70', impedance is not the only number you'll be running up, and the last place you want this load is for LF channels. I'd try to find a way around it.
Did you ever say how the "multi-channel" aspect of your newly enhanced Placette works? The idea would be to eat as much of the distance as possible with fully buffered lines while still allowing the amps to be "safe", perhaps even visable. Anything you could do to shorten the LF speaker cables would be a plus.
And I 2nd the cheap mock-up, to start, or at least try to think of a way to break the project into stages, to avoid the expensive disaster.
Thinking about your options, I would locate the driver at the top inside corner of the horns (horns viewed while looking into mouth), and develop the horn flare from there. See explanations below:
Driver located high and inside: "Hypotenus wall" of horn is parallel with ceiling > Good transition to ceiling; vertical walls of horns are parallel to each other > Maintains most L/R separation; Easiest to build > Only one curved wall per horn
The following solutions I would consider less optimal, getting progressively worse with progress down the page:
Driver located low and inside: Vertical walls of horns are parallel to each other > L/R separation still ok; horizontal wall is parallel to floor of room; hypotenus wall is not parallel to ceiling, but intersects ceiling at an angle > Transition to ceiling not ideal; Easiest to build > Only one curved wall per horn
Driver centered: Vertical walls of horns are converging toward each other > Some compromise in L/R separation; hypotenus wall is not parallel to ceiling, but intersects ceiling at an angle > Some compromise in transition to ceiling; Most difficult to build > All walls curved
Driver located high and outside: Hypotenus wall of horn is parallel with ceiling > Good transition to ceiling; vertical walls of horns are converging toward each other > Most compromise in L/R separation; Difficult to build > Two curved walls per horn
Yes, Jessie, the idea of the triangle horns with some kind of location of the drivers is what I was thinking as well. This week my attic, the walls, the beams and all the rest of the things will be expected and we will convert it to AutoCAD. Then I will decide what space is available for me and from there I will conclude what kind horns I might end up with. My preliminary inspection last tow days indicate the I will have much less useable space then I would like it to be as some of the main frame element are on the way that significantly reduce the size of the available mouths. I do not know. Until I have a full lay of the land with dimensions and distance I would hold my breath. I am looking at the alternative versions, if my attic scenario will not go. I do have some but none of them as elegant as if I put them in attic.
The Battery Powered Picklejar Heads are photographed with their First Place Runner-Up Champion’s Award.
First Lego League teams from Lexington scored high marks at the Robonautica Eight State Competition Dec. 20. One of them will head to the world championships in April.
The Llamas won the First Place Robot Performance Award, receiving the highest score in the robot match. The Dork Side of the Force won the Honors Robot Consistency Award (Second place Robot Consistency) because they had the second smallest difference (20 points) between their highest and lowest scores.
The Battery Powered Picklejar Heads won “First Runner Up, Champion’s Award” because they had the second highest overall score of all of the teams in Massachusetts.
The Champion’s Award “…is the most prestigious award that any team can with. It celebrates the ultimate success of the FIRST mission and FLL values … To be considered for the Champion’s Award, teams must perform well in the equally weighted technical and team presentation categories,” according to the First Lego League Web site.
The Battery Powered Pickle Jar Heads came in second out of 64 teams competing at the state level, winning one of only two invitations to the World First Lego League Festival competition in Atlanta, Ga. in April 2009. At the World Festival, they will be 1 of only 84 top teams invited from around the world to compete for the world championship.
In the First Lego League competitions, teams use Lego Mindstorms NXT robots, as well as Lego and Technic pieces, to design a robot and build attachments to complete assigned tasks. The robots must complete a set of specified tasks in 150 seconds, and the team must also complete a project based on the years First Lego League (FLL) theme. This year’s theme is Climate Connections, and the teams connected local climate-related problems to similar problems elsewhere in the world, and discover a new solution to the problem.
The qualifying teams were: The Battery Powered Picklejar Heads, a community team; the Dork Side of the Force, a Lexington Girl Scouts Team; the Lexington Robos, from Harrington Elementary School; the Llamas, from the MIT Lincoln Labs; and the Smokin Robots, also from Lincoln Labs.
These teams all competed in at least one qualifying competition each, and placed high enough to win the right to go to the state competition.
At the North Quincy Qualifying Tournament, The Battery Powered Picklejar Heads received third place in Robot Performance with 135 points, then went on to receive the Runner-Up Champions Award at North Quincy.
The Runner-Up Champion Award is the second-most prestigious award, next only to the Overall Champion Award.
The Dork Side of the Force came in fifth in Robot Performance, with 130, and also won the Against All Odds Award.
The Battery Powered Picklejar Heads won the First Place Research Quality Award at the Blackstone Valley Qualifier. For their Research Project, the Battery Powered Picklejar Heads studied the effects of climate change on the bluefin tuna industry, and came up with a creative solution to the problem of bluefin overfishing and climate change.
In conducting their research, the team consulted with many experts in the tuna field, including Professor Ted Bestor, chairman of the Harvard Anthropology department and leading expert on the Tsukiji fish market. Tsukiji is the main fish market for raw fish in the world.
The team is also featured on the Web site of Dr. Molly Lutcavage, the director of the Large Pelagics Research Center at the University of New Hampshire, at largepelagics.unh.edu/firstlego08.htm.

We’ve wasted no time in starting off the new season. We have constructed our full field setup, in addition to ordering REAL walls this year! We decided that they would be important since our masonite/PVC walls flex much more than the real thing. Our new development technique is in full swing as well, and we already have a new concept robot which seems to hold great potential. The idea is that we have one month “sprints” in which we go all out in building a complete robot, learning from each sprint. We’ll post photos at the end of this sprint, which will be on October 28th.

Michelle Profit writes about the importance of Estate Planning, Wills, Trusts, Specials Needs Planning, Long-Term Care Planning and other important topics on her estate planning blog.
Trust can be a key aspect of whether blended families will fight over an estate, after a loved one passes away.
Blended families are often the ultimate source of problems in estate litigation. When there are children from multiple marriages and stepparents who all have a potential stake in an estate, fights over the estate are more likely to occur. An estate planning attorney can help you find solutions for planning for blended families.
The Financial Times recently discussed this in an advice column titled "Should I trust my wife to divide my assets fairly?" A man who was on his second marriage wanted to make sure both of his children received an equal share of his estate. The children were each from a different marriage, so the man was concerned that his second wife might not leave the same amount of money to the child from his first marriage, if he left everything to her first.
That is not to say that stepparents can never be trusted to divide everything equally. However, the real trust factor to be concerned about, is not the trust between the husband and wife. The real concern should be the trust between the stepparent and the stepchild. The better they get along and trust each other, the more likely they will work together without fighting over an estate.
It is normally best not to leave things up to trust. Estate planning attorneys can give you many different options for making sure everyone in your family is appropriately taken care of, regardless whether they trust each other.

The service has already been trialled in 51 branches across the UK, Isle of Man and Channel Islands. The bank has partnered with Qudini, a London-based technology software company, to improve customer experience via this software.
The trial has already led to increases in the number of appointments being made across community banking, telephony and in-branch banking services.
Qudini’s appointment booking software - rolled out in January 2018 - has led to a 70 per cent increase in the number of appointments for the NatWest Community Banker service.
Commenting on the software, Annamaria Jatta, NatWest’s innovation lead, said: “Across our branch network, we have been working with Qudini to strengthen the customer experience to allow customers to bank at a time and location which suits their schedules.
“We have seen a significant increase in the number of customers being served in-branch alongside an increase in the number of appointments being made across our telephony and community banking services.”
Qudini enables NatWest community bankers to book appointments with their customers, who can then amend or cancel their appointment at any time using their mobile phone.
The bank also uses the software to support its telephony service, to provide NatWest customers with more flexibility and options to access the support they require when seeking advice for products such as loans and mortgages.
This has led to more customers being served at a location and time which suits them best, be that utilising technology at home, or in branch and this has led to a 28 per cent reduction in the number of missed appointments.
Since the introduction of Qudini software in branches, NatWest has been able to provide customers with live and accurate queuing times and advisor availability through a concierge service, enabling customers to bank at their convenience.
Jatta highlighted: “Since the introduction of Qudini, the in-branch customer journey has completely transformed. At peak times, customers are able to leave the branch, continue their day and return when they are next in line to be served.”
Imogen Wethered, CEO and co-founder of Qudini, added: “We’d always expected that financial services could be slow. But NatWest have been so fast, clear in their plans and very innovative to work with.”

The vision driving our world is capitalism. It is about organizing nature and society to serve capital. It is slowly turning into a disaster. Another vision is needed. This is about the dying vision and the emerging vision. It is about giving our grandchildren and their grandchildren hope.
There are powerful forces in our world unleashed by growing inequality. They are a significant part of where Donald J Trump found the people who were so angry they stopped thinking and voted for him. They fueled Brexit. They are being used to whip up anti-immigrant and religious hatred across Europe. A key source of inequality has been the series of trade deals designed by huge corporations for their benefit and the benefit of those who own them at the expense of workers whose jobs are disappearing, wages and benefits shrinking. Youth are looking at futures significantly worse off than their parents. Huge debts, unstable work opportunities with no hope of the home ownership their parents enjoyed. They will not have the homes they grew up in. Some inequality facts:
There are positive visions that we can adopt to build a better world and there are negative ones that can be used to destroy and sew chaos. Stirring hate between groups for political purposes – the politics of lies, fear, hatred, violence and revenge – has often been a tactic of political extremists from the right and left. The outcomes legitimize the worst fringe extremists. A warped nationalism is often part of the tactics. “Just as love for one individual that excludes love for others is not love, love for one’s country that is not part of one’s love for humanity is not love, but idolatrous worship.” Eric Fromm, The Sane Society. The America first rhetoric is idolatrous worship. We need to turn to the positive visions.
A vision of Global Co-operation as explored in my book or Rutger Bregman’s proposal for a ‘universal basic incomes’ to eliminate poverty in his book Utopia for Realists are both visions of a better world. They seek not to pit people against each other but to link hands and spirits in a common constructive endeavour. Both ideas would eliminate poverty. Both would provide space for people to make the contribution to society they wish to make.
But is it realistic to think bold new visions are more than idle dreams? Says Bregman: “I’ve heard for three years that many of my ideas are unrealistic and unreasonable and that we can’t afford them,” he says, by way of preamble to a more comprehensive reply. “And the simple answer is ‘Oh, you want to stick to the status quo? How’s that been working out?’” (Andrew Anthony in the Guardian 26 Oct 2017 (https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/26/rutger-bregman-utopia-for-realists-interview-universal-basic-income?CMP=fb_gu) Growing inequality into the foreseeable future may be someone’s vision but it is surely even less realistic. It is insane.
People who see themselves and their children being sacrificed to feed growing inequality should be angry. And they can and should do something. They will get more satisfaction out of building a better world than being betrayed by the false promises of billionaires who unlike them do not pay taxes.
“The Oxfam report An Economy for the 1%, shows that the wealth of the poorest half of the world’s population has fallen by a trillion dollars since 2010, a drop of 38 percent. This has occurred despite the global population increasing by around 400 million people during that period. Meanwhile, the wealth of the richest 62 has increased by more than half a trillion dollars to $1.76tr. The report also shows how women are disproportionately affected by inequality – of the current ‘62’, 53 are men and just nine are women.” https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2016-01-18/62-people-own-same-half-world-reveals-oxfam-davos-report
This is the opening paragraph describing Oxfam’s newest report on inequality released for the DAVOS meetings . It is this performance by the global capitalist economy that fuels the unrest that is opening the door to the politics of lies, fear, hatred, violence and revenge. Elders are told their pensions are no longer secure and there will soon be too many of them to care for. Young people are told to forget stable careers, having pensions and benefits, paying off huge student loans or owning a home. Parents see a bleak future for their children and grandchildren. This is not the output of a functional economy but a faltering one.
Is this the climate that could allow millions of good people who are desperate for change to be manipulated by the politics of lies, fear, hatred, violence and revenge to vote for a billionaire who does not pay taxes, cannot seem to tell the truth and who is a self-confessed sexual predator? Is this what causes angry and bewildered people to elect a leader who will cut government services, lower taxes on corporations and the rich, and allow destruction of the environment their grandchildren will inherit?
From Corporate Globalization to Global Co-operation suggests an alternative. There are practical steps young people and elders can take. Many people took steps to shift to an alternative during the Standing Rock demonstrations in North Dakota. More about that in a later post. In the meantime read the Oxfam’s report, An Economy for the 1%. Then think about how we can create a new economy individually and in groups.

Actually what it supervulkan or super volcano? As the name implies, supervulkan is a volcano that could produce a volcanic eruption with the material larger than 1,000 cubic km.
Eruption 1,000 times larger than most historic volcanic eruption.Supervulkan can occur when magma in the bowels of the Earth rises into the crust of a hot spot, but could not break the crust.The pressure built within a large magma pool and continue to grow until the crust is no longer able to accommodate the pressure. They also can form a plate boundary, such as Lake Toba in North Sumatra, and the location of continental hot spots, such as Yellowstone in the United States. Discovery Channel said there were six supervulkan in the world, three of which exist in the U.S., the Yellowstone, Long Valley, and the Valles Caldera.
Furthermore, Lake Toba, Taupo Volcano in New Zealand, and the Aira Caldera in the middle there Sakurajima Volcano in Japan. Although only mentioned there are six supervulkan, supervulkan eruption usually affects a very large area with lava and volcanic ash and causing long-term changes in weather such as triggering the small ice, which is threatening the extinction of some species. Volcano and geological experts are not using the term supervulkan. But, after 2003, the term is used when speaking in public. Eruptions that reach index volcanic eruptions (VEI) 8 termed the "super eruption." One supervulkan currently closely monitored is Lake Toba in North Sumatra, Indonesia.
This lake had erupted around 67500-75500 years lalu.Erupsi Toba was the last of a series that led to at least three caldera eruptions that occurred at the volcano with caldera caldera formed about 700000-840000 earlier last year. Last eruption VEI 8 that it has described as the eruption megakolosal.Dengan these facts, it is possible that the eruption was the largest explosive volcanic eruptions in the last 25 million years. Toba eruption can not be compared with the eruption of another volcano or caldera has ever experienced the Earth since man could walk upright.
In fact, the eruption of Mount Krakatoa, which caused dozens of people dead in 1883, just a fingernail-sized black when compared with the eruption of Toba. Toba eruptions have the power of 150 megatons of TNT. The comparison, an atomic bomb Hirohsima "only" have the power 0.015 megaton explosion and collapse 10,000 times weaker than the eruption of Krakatoa.According to scientists, the eruption of Toba nearly wiped out the human race decades ago. Eruption spewed about 2,800 cubic kilometers of material-some 2,000 km kubiknya fell to the ground and about 800 cubic kilometers fell as dust, then the wind took him to the west. Rock flow eruption destroyed an area of 20,000 sq. km. Vulkaniknya dust blanketing almost the entire South Asian region with an average thickness of nearly 15 cm.
In one region of India, the Toba ash reaching a thickness of up to 6 meters and partly covered with volcanic ash Malaysia 9 meters thick. In addition, about 10,000 million metric tons of sulfuric acid is also released during the Toba eruption. As a result, there is acid rain. According to catastrophe theory, eruption of Toba cause the Earth experienced volcanic winter for 6-10 years, which resulted in a decrease manusia.Beberapa population researcher explained that the Toba eruption not only causes great volcanic winter, but also add episode cooling the Earth for 1,000 years. Toba caldera is the only supervulkan which can be described as brothers "larger" for the Yellowstone Caldera in the U.S..
By spewing 2800 cubic kilometers of material, the Toba eruption was even bigger than the super eruption happened 2.1 million years ago that formed Island Park Caldera in Idaho, USA. At that time, Yellowstone eruption spewed 2500 cubic kilometers of material. Toba eruption was also about three times bigger than the last eruption Lava Creek Yellowstones at 630,000 last year.Other comparisons, in addition to Krakatau, is the largest volcanic eruption in history, namely eruption of Mount Tambora, Sumbawa, Indonesia, in 1815. Tambora eruption spewed about 100 cubic miles of rock and causes in 1816 as a year without a summer in the northern region of the Earth. While the eruption of Mount St. Helen's in Washington State, USA, spewing about 1.2 cubic kilometers of material.
The largest known eruption occurred since the eruption of Toba is oruanui Volcano eruption Taupo, New Zealand, which spew about 530 cubic kilometers of magma. Subsequent collapse to form a caldera, which after filling with water, forming the Lake Toba. Samosir Island in the middle of the lake was formed by the dome of the caldera floor due to magma movements inside the Earth.
Incomplete feel if you visited the North Sumatra did not stop for a moment to Lake Toba, volcanic lake which is the largest lake in Indonesia, and even Southeast Asia. Exotic charm vast expanse of the lake like a sea with shady trees and hills, charming. The lake, measuring 1700 square meters with a depth of approximately 450 meters and lies 906 meters above sea level, in the middle of the lake there is Samosir Island became the object of not less interesting excursions.
During his visit in 1996, Prince Bernard of the Netherlands even expressed his admiration for the beautiful panorama of the lake."Sell me name to this lake. I can not describe how beautiful Lake Toba, "he says enthusiastically.
It is estimated that Lake Toba explosion occurred at about 73 thousand-75 thousand years ago and is a super volcano eruption (super volcano) the most recent. Bill Rose and Craig Chesner from Michigan Technological University estimate that volcanic materials spewed out of the mountain as much as 2800 km ³, with 800 km ³ of rock Ignimbrite and 2,000 km ³ of volcanic ash which is expected in the wind to west for two weeks.
Volcanic dust in the wind has spread to half the earth, from China to South Africa. Explosion occurred during the week and throw the dust up to 10 km above sea level.
This incident caused mass death and, in some species, also followed by extinction. According to some DNA evidence, this eruption also reduced the number of people to about 60% of the total human population of the earth at that time, which is about 60 million people. The eruption was also contributed to the occurrence of ice ages, although the experts still debate.
After the eruption, the caldera formed which is then filled with water and became what is now known as Lake Toba. Pressure upward by magma that has not come out cause the emergence of Samosir Island. While enjoying the beauty of this lake, you might not imagine that the charm of the place comes from the catastrophic volcanic eruptions that brought fear and horror at the time. Travel overland to Lake Toba, precisely to Parapat, takes four to five hours from Medan. Available bus or travel directly to Parapat.The route through the Lubuk Pakam, Cliff High, and turn toward Siantar. Along the way, we were treated to a panorama of palm oil and rubber plantations.
When using the train, from Medan select a route to Siantar. From here the journey continues by bus to Parapat. Latency for an hour.
For a place to stay and stay longer enjoyed the beauty of Lake Toba, there are many hotels and inns. In Parapat, there are at least 900 hotel rooms of all types, ranging from four star to homestay, in Tuktuk also not different. Both in Parapat and Tuktuk, tourists can instantly enjoy the lake from the rim. Rates for hotels in Parapat Tuktuk and varied, according to typical tourists who come. Starting from Rp 30 thousand to USD 500 thousand per night depending on the type of hotel.
A travel companies even offer to enjoy the beauty of Lake Toba from the air, ie use paragliding. Every tourists were given the opportunity to fly using the paragliding from the mountains Tongging District, Tanah Karo, Sumatera Utara. For tourists who want to try paragliding will be accompanied by an experienced instructor, but of course determination can fly or not depends on weather conditions and wind.
Not only that, enjoy the beautiful sunrise and sunset you can enjoy from the coastal lakes. From the Karo highlands on the north, the lake looks elongated beauty viewed from Sikodonkodon.However, there is only one resort here. On the west side, views of the lake and the island of Samosir can be perfectly seen from the Tele. There is a viewing post at an altitude of about 1,000 meters from sea level to enjoy the sunset on Lake Toba.
The Dubai Financial Market (DFM) (Arabic: سوق دبي المالي‎) is a stock exchange located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It was founded on March 26, 2000.
As of 2014[update], there are 67 companies listed on DFM. Most of them are UAE-based companies and a few others are dual listings for companies based in other MENA region countries. Foreign companies are from the following countries: Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, and Sudan. Many companies allow foreigners to own their shares.
During 2004 and 2005, there were significant increases in the volume of shares traded and the share prices of many companies. However, towards the end of 2005 and through the first few months of 2006 the bubble burst and share values dropped by around 60% on DFM, along with similar decreases in most other Persian Gulf stock markets.
DFM is one of three stock exchanges in the UAE. Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) also lists mostly UAE companies and NASDAQ Dubai was set up to trade international stocks.
DFM and ADX are both governed and regulated by the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA). SCA has the authority to impose laws and standards in which DFM and ADX have to comply with. SCA’s role is to ensure that the laws are followed by the exchanges as well as to protect investors’, brokers’ and listed companies’ rights.
On the other hand, NASDAQ Dubai is governed to international standards by an independent regulator called the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), which is equivalent to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S. Unlike DFM and ADX, NASDAQ Dubai, located in Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), is an electronic exchange with no trading floor.
DFM was a fully owned by Dubai government until November 2006 when it turned into a public joint-stock company through an IPO, which led to sell 20% of its shares to public and 80% were subscribed by Borse Dubai, which is owned by Dubai government. As a matter of fact, DFM’s IPO has been oversubscribed by 118 times.
Like the revenue, DFM's net profit dropped sharply from the period ended 2007 till 2011. In 2007, DFM profits reached 1,439.6 million including none operational profits coming from IPO of AED 468 million. In 2008, profits are only 605 AED million. The next year, in 2009, the profit dropped even further and reached 346.62. In 2010, another drop took place and profits reached AED 79 million. Unfortunately, in 2011, DFM recorded a loss of AED 6.45 million. From the trend, we can imply that the situation is not improving, but is deteriorating year after year. DFM BOD members, executives, and managers are working hard to get out DFM from this unforeseen dilemma.
Please note that Emirates Bank International (EBI) and National Bank of Dubai (NBD) had been merged to form a holding company to run both entities named Emirates National Bank of Dubai (ENBD), this merger resulted in cancelling both shares and issuing a new one listed on the October 16, 2007.[3]
Both AMLAK and TAMWEEL were suspended from trading since the November 23, 2008 as they announced a merger action.[4]
Please note that as of July 27, 2009, the trading symbol for the Islamic Arab Insurance company (IAIC) will be changed into SALAMA.[5]

Does anyone know where I could find the sheet music for Timothy Seth Avett's song Guilty? The piano in that song is so beautiful and I've been wanting to learn it for a long time...
So, during the past weekend, I added load/lrun capabilities to ZEsarUX emulator. It already exists lbytes support, you can now load any QL program. It's still in experimental mode, so many programs may fail
A: These rules are applied to all areas of both the forum and the game. While you are not required to read these rules, not being aware of them is not and never will be an excuse to not follow them. Repeat offences are subject to increased punishments. Please note that while this post covers all of the basic rules, it is by no means a comprehensive list of every punishable action - a healthy dose of common sense does wonders in keeping one out of trouble. Please note that breaking some rules will have worse punishments than others.
Insulting other members of the game for any reason is not allowed. We wish to maintain a friendly environment, and any flaming or harassment will result in a ban. This includes any homophobic or racial slurs in public space - for more information read here.
Pornography/gore/warez etc. are not allowed anywhere at any time for any reason within the Toribash community. Any content of this type in any form will result in a severe ban. This includes linking, requesting, or mentioning such content, this community is not the place for it.
A scam occurs when two players come to an agreement or deal for any sort of transaction, be it in the market, dueling, or otherwise, and one party fails or refuses to meet their side of the deal. Scams will be severely punished, and anything owed by the offender will be sent from their account. If you have been scammed, you should create a post in the Scam Reports section of the forum. Make sure to read the big red announcements first.
Any form of hacking or exploitation of any bugs for any reason will be severely punished. If you suspect a bug in either the forums or the game, please contact an administrator immediately and do not share information of the bug with anyone else.
Soft rules, such as "no shoveling" or "no decap openers" are not supported. While you may agree to them in cases of dueling, they will not be upheld by the staff if either party does not stand by the agreement. In addition, placing soft rules on any form of event or bet server is strictly prohibited.
Accounts may not be sold, traded, or transferred to another person in any way. Any account found to be transferred temporarily or any attempts to transfer an account will result in a permanent ban of the account in question as well as appropriate punishment for any other users involved.
Use of the broadcast system should be limited to advertising in-game tournaments and events. Advertising market items, requesting duels, making non-event related announcements, or any other uses of the system will result in a ban. Broadcasts should also not contain any profane language.
A: These are the rules you need to follow no matter where you're posting on the forums. Each part of the forum usually has its own additional rules which need to be followed in addition to the ones listed here. Occasionally, the local rules may override one or more of the global rules here. You must also still follow the Global Rules.
A post is considered a useless post if it does not contribute to the thread and will be deleted and the user will be warned/infracted. To avoid useless posting make sure to read the rules of the specific sub-forum that you are posting in.
Backseat moderation is when a user that is not moderator of a said board tries to enforce rules on other members. If you see a post/thread that is against the rules use the report button under the user's name. This will notify a moderator and they will take proper action.
Usually you should not bump a thread that is over two weeks old. In the off-topic or discussion board however, you can feel free to bump a thread at anytime as long as you are adding to the discussion
A: These are the rules that you must follow everywhere in-game, unless specifically stated otherwise. You must also still follow the Global Rules.
Firstly, a decap prize is a PUBLIC mini event that is available in any server with the command /decapprize [TC amount] used to add any number between 1 and 20,000 TC to the server. The server will award said TC to the person that succeeded in decapping the other person's tori (assuming they also win the match).
What is rigging a Decap Prize? Rigging a DP means you are setting up the DP to be taken by a specific user or users, be that anyone including yourself. This does not matter if the DP has "your TC" in it. If TC was added to the DP it was donated and, once donated, is no longer yours and you have NO CLAIM to it at that time or in the future. This means that any attempt to take the TC because "it was yours before you put it in" will be treated as a Decap Prize Rig. If you believe a DP was rigged, or you believe one is about to be rigged, please contact a Staff Member and/or make a Scam Report. TAKE SCREENSHOTS and please try to provide a replay. Secondary note: The type of server makes no difference, be it a tournament, bet server, public room etc. Decap prize is public prize and is to ALWAYS BE WON FAIRLY. Any deviation from this rule results in serious punishment.
Using the decap prize to intentionally transfer TC for whatever reason (e.g. to hide transfers or send money to accounts below 20 qi) is prohibited and will be punished as an abuse of system. Any similar workaround transfers will be punished similarly.
Room names and descriptions should be kept appropriate. Insults, profanity, racial slurs, and any other inappropriate material is not allowed in room names or descriptions.
Soft rules, such as "no shoveling" or "no decap openers" are not supported. While you may agree to them in cases of dueling, they will not be upheld by the staff in the case of a report or complaint under any circumstance. In addition, placing soft rules on any form of event or bet server is strictly prohibited.
Farming is defined as any method(s) used to cirumvent the legitimate earning of TC and/or Qi. This includes such things as using bots to play for you, abusing some bug or exploit, multiclienting to farm boosters etc. Farming will be severely punished
Multi-clienting occurs when two or more clients are connected to any one room from the same network. When this occurs, (MC) appears next to the names of multi-clienting account. Multi-clienting is forbidden (and often prevented) in any official servers. Players are allowed multi-client in private rooms.
Playing in official beginner rooms on an alternate account will result in you receiving an IP ban from the beginner rooms. Leave the beginner rooms to legitimate beginners.
Any kind of bots playing the game automatically are not allowed. You may use scripts to quickly perform moves, however if you are found AFK-botting, you will be immediately banned.
Bots managing rooms without the presence of a human operator are not allowed. Bots may not be /house of any room.
It's very easy to find screenshots. They will most likely be in the following directories on Local Disk (usually C:):
Once you have a screenshot of toribash if you wish to upload it you must visit a third party website. Such as imgur, Gyazo, puush, or tinypic. Please note if you are reporting something, do NOT use the toribash forum's built in image uploader. It will make it difficult to read and you will most likely be asked to upload it to an image hosting site.
After you have uploaded your screenshot to an image hosting website, you can copy the image's link (right click and copy image address works best) and paste the link in between [img][/img] tags.
A: Creating a betting server is extremely easy, but the options involved can be subjective. It is up to the creator of the server to decide the various rules that may be included in the server. But just some basics...
Typing in /jo [server name] will create a server instantly. Now before you go off globalling your server (which will be explained), be sure to set an owner password.
The owner password can be set by typing in /setowner [password] and then if for any reason your de-op'd or ping, leave ect. you can re-op yourself by typing in /ownerpass [password]. It is not a bad idea to give this password to other OP's in the server. But please, only share it people you trust.
Setting a good room description via /desc [text] is extremely valuable for the longevity of your bet server. An eye-catching description in the server list will keep people trickling in to replace those who leave over time.
Using a message of the day (MOTD) entry message is useful for letting new joiners know important information, such as the current price of nudges and who is running the room. Set a motd with /motd [text].
It's usually a good idea to set /maxclients [number]. A safe amount is generally around 20, although 25-30 is common. High values can cause the room to be unstable and it will often crash.
Being "House" (server admin) allows you receive a portion of every bet made. To become "House" you simply type in /house [username] and be sure to set the Max Rake by typing in /maxrake [amount]. You can also make money by placing bets like everyone else and by selling nudges.
Finally, it can be a good idea to add yourself to the VIP list via /vip ADD [yourname]. This will allow you to join the server even if its full.
Make sure you're familiar with the operator commands! Without them, you won't be able to run your room smoothly, if at all.
A: Bet servers are a place for high stakes fun. The best experience is usually provided if the room is running as smoothly as possible. To achieve this, you should know at least some basics, such as:
HBRs: Highest Bet Rounds are matches where the user with the highest bet placed by the end of the betframes will be rewarded (usually with a free nudge).
Decapprize: Decapprizes are a public pool of tc which is kept by the server and awarded to any user who both decaps their opponent and wins their match. A large decapprize can attract people to your server.
Muting/Kicking/Banning: It's very important to keep the chat free of annoyances such as spam or flaming. Utilise the powers granted to Ops to keep your room a fun place for users to be.
(/nudge [username][position]) is generally one of the most demanding but important aspects of bet server management. Nudging is not manditory, however they are expected of you and a host who refuses to give nudges will often find their server short-lived. Nudges are usually first come, first served, and many server Ops will give different prioritization to how the user purchased their nudge. For example, someone who was nudged for adding to the decapprize may be considered lower-priority to someone who paid for a nudge, and would be nudged beneath them instead.
There are a few often-used approaches to trading nudges (MAKE SURE TO READ THE RULES REGARDING NUDGES BELOW):
Selfbet: Users who promise to bet a specified amount on themselves at the start of their match can be nudged.
A: While a lot of the management is up to you as the host, bet servers do have their own set of rules which you can't ignore. Bet servers are a place where a lot of TC is up in the air; that means a lot of potentially upset people who feel like maybe they've been screwed over. Following the rules will spare you from upset users and potential punishment from staff:
Kicking and banning is done at your own discretion. However, if a user has purchased a nudge in a way advertised by your server (whether it be adding to the DP or paying you directly) do not kick/ban them unless there is a good reason for it(blatant racism, spamming ect). Always take screens, and even then it is a good idea to contact a Staff Member. Remember, we're here to help! If an OP kicks or bans you for no apparent reason while you have a pending nudge or TC currently being bet, please submit a Scam Report with evidence.
If you or your server is advertising nudges with any sort of payment whatsoever, OP's may not nudge themselves or others without them first paying what everyone else has to pay. (This rule also comes with common sense; if you are running a betting server your primary goal should be to make sure everyone is having a good time and maybe make some TC with the rake. Don't ruin it for everyone.) It will be up to the Staff Member making the decision, on what is classified as OP power abuse in such instances. I will say again, use common sense. Don't make the server miserable or do something fishy.
If in a Betting server during a game, one of the players does minimal movement which results in decap in first 4 turns, the game is invalid. The server's OP has to pause the game, collect evidence and reset the game. If one of players is afk, he should be fknocked.
Satisfying evidence is at least: screenshot of /decapprize, screenshot showing active bets (it can be list of refunds after /cancelbets), screenshot of the chat & decap while paused and a replay saved during pause (that shows moves until the pause). Screenshots must include whole TB window, if they are cropped, they can be considered invalid.
If a fighting player claims that OP's reset was an abuse of power and the decap was valid, OP will be required to provide all the evidence for his reset. Staff will then judge if the reset was legitimate - if it was not, OP will have to pay/refund TC equal to DP at that time or face being banned. If the suspected OP lacks proper reset evidence, and the player has screenshots proving that OP did reset that game, OP will be punished for not following the rules and will possibly also have to refund the DP.
Resets should not be used if it can cause harm to any player, (being fighter or better). In such instances, the OP should be reported to a Staff Member. Any harm done may be rectified with the OP's items/TC.
If you are playing a match with active bets, and you quit or spectate before the match has concluded, you could face a ban. Of course, every situation may be different, and it will be up to the staff member's discretion on how to handle each situation.
Fuke (or Force uke) is in no way allowed. While the command is disabled, any combination of commands that has the same results as /fuke will be punished. This includes nudging then fknock commands. No command should interrupt the match.
If there is ANY amount of tc bet on BOTH people you may not cancelbets. Once the money has been bet you are accepting that you may lose this tc in it's entirety. Cancelbets is only to be used if there are no counters at all., but is at the hosters own discretion.
Soft rules, such as "no shovelling" or "no decap openers" are not supported. They are also prohibited in betting servers. If a betting server you are in is trying to enforce Soft Rules, please contact a Staff Member or make a General Report with evidence.
You can use whatever mod you want for the betting server, however if you are changing any gamerules in it (e.g. making the dismemberment threshold higher), you must inform about any changes in your room's motd. If players (including you) are contributing to the decapprize, you are not allowed to change the gamerules or mod in any way until the decapprize is earned.
If an op calls HBR via chat or /cp then the HBR comes into effect. If a bet is placed that exceeds all those before and after then that bet counts as the HBR and must be given the rewrad that is associated with winning HBR (usually a nudge).
I think I agree with what you said in the Dungeon topic, Justin. They could separate the CATCF building and Burger Kitchen into a separate theme area (possibly to be added as part of The Towers maybe). For the actual retheme of CCL... it's maybe possible that they will still do the Walliams World idea, but how much sense would it be to do all this for one year? I'm thinking they'll do the Dungeon and retheme of Burger Kitchen for 2019 and we'll get a retheme of the rest of CCL to something more light hearted like the Walliams theme for 2020.
If we were to take the Gangsta Granny idea, and it wasn't to use the Charlie building, then I could see it going in the old Ice Age building. It could be rethemed to a simulator type attraction, similar to that seen in Shrek in London!
Personally, I think that 2019 will introduce Walliams World. However I personally would prefer an original Fairytale Village style themed area rather than an IP. I havent got anything against IP's but Fairytale Village opens up more possibilities.
Twirling Toadstool could come back, Charlie can be revamped with projections and a little projected water show finale and other attractions such as Wobble World, the Theatre and Nickelodeon: Outta Control can be used for new attractions and maybe even reposition Frog Hopper into CBeebies Land so that they can use the theatre for a live show, Wobble World to become a permanent House Of Monsters with a tweaked storyline to fit the area, then the old Coaster Corner becomes a water coaster.
Frog Hopper could just go to where it used to be before Ice Age 4D closed, as I don't believe it would suit CBeebies all that well.
That's right in front of Nickelodeon: Outta Control though isn't it cause I really want that building being used again. I place it next to it and in front of another exterior
A few people have touched on this, and it's something I remember from an old forum, but I really think spooky is the way to go. Reason being...
GW and DF - It doesn't make sense having 2 separate areas. Duel is surely due to be replaced or removed, why not focus on one large spooky themed area.
HEX and The Towers would naturally link DF and CCL to make one large area within the towers boundary walls.
The currently colourful, but easily painted building facades could easily be themed with vines are to give the impression of the old town which has been taken over by the ever spreading 13 theme. It could even be told in with a tag story that the 13 forest is creeping to overrun the towers linked to the Hex curse, possible reboot for a few rides as part of it. That would make the whole area perfect for Scarefest.
Most rides could be easily rethememed; Charlie and the cinema. Even an indoor coaster eventually with the entrance off CCL but ride building behind using the old coaster corner area, (indoor coaster would solve the noise issue which led to coaster corners closure originally).
I'm not keen on IPs, they're often dated before they even begin and only get worse over time. Yes they're good for marketing initially but they just don't get done well.
Dark themes are too easy for Merlin. I want something which has more depth, something of a quality we haven't seen since the early Tussauds era. Not just a cheap, spooky overlay of what's already there.
Yep dark is inexpensive to do because you can often just buy old bits of junk in for theming and a lack of painting or TLC doesn't show. Not really a suprise that Merlin loves it these days.
Saying that the themeing around Wicker Man was excellent and I hope they put as much effort into the CCL revamp.
I'm quite happy for a dark theme to continue to Burger Kitchen and Charlie. This seems more logical if The Dungeons were to go there and have CCL as a separate area. I must agree though, I would like a light or magical/explorer theme to come to CCL.
I'm actually a bit confused as to why the CCL Burger Kitchen still exists tbh. The condition that the building itself is in is terrible, and the gaps where you can see around the edges of the building shouldn't be there at all. As for The Dungeon – I genuinely don't want it to happen. It's not the type of attraction that Alton Towers need at the moment and the location couldn't be any worse as it'll just make the CCL area seem even more mismatched. CCL needs a drastic overhaul, but The Dungeons can't be part of it in order for it to work.
Dark themes are not a problem in my eyes, They can feel very different. For example compare Wicker Man and X-Sector, you would say both areas have 'dark themes' but the feeling they give is distinct. Now compare this to other Dungeons, Dark Forest, Forbidden Valley each of them have their own distinct feel. I would take a Dungeons tavern over CCL Burger Kitchen any day. CCL Burger Kitchen is very cheesy, dated and tacky.
Compare this to Thorpe where they have rides like Saw and TWD:TR where they are based off American Horror IP's and that's when it becomes a problem.
However, although the themes are similar the experience, especially on Saw, is incredible. Soley because of the indoor section and use of the storyline, when done right it can be pulled off.
Alton need happier themes in order to balance the park. Thorpe can pull Swarm, DGBT, Living Nightmare, TWD:TR & Saw off because there is also Tidal Wave, Stealth, Colossus and Inferno with more pleasant themes. It is an art of balance.
Keep the theme, but make it look abandoned, have it so the Dark Forest has taken over, so include trees and branches. Just a place that looks run down and isolated but that's apart of the theme. Completely take down Charlie and build a junior suspended coaster in its place. Then get rid of Rita and replace it with an Intamin multi launch coaster which starts in the Dark Forest and goes into the newly themed CCL.
You'd have to admit, that would look amazing. The aesthetics of a nature lead overrun section of a park would be so eerily awesome. Whenever I see an old, abandoned theme park, it looks absolutely stunning. Maybe they could do a sort of mix, where nature has overrun the area, but instead of it only being just the Wraiths, maybe some more light themed magical forest creatures could come out of the woods. Then you get the amazing aesthetics while keeping the more child orientated aim.
It would be an interesting idea if it was the antithesis to the Dark Forrest like a similar theme but it's like an opposing force of good. It means it could be a brighter area but with a theme linked to its neighbour area, and it would be nice to expand the lore of the wraiths of the Dark Forrest which aren't as developed as other park areas.
As a mum I have to say I like that CCL is aimed at a slightly younger audience. When visiting with a family with various wants from the park CCL is a great break after Dark Forest for the older ones. My little boy loves the very outdated needing a paint job carousel and after starting the day at CBeebies, he can go to CCL while I enjoy Rita and Thirteen and he doesn’t have to stand around waiting too long.
I’d love to see this area remain light for a younger audience, just improved some. I’m not fussed about an IP to be honest because as mentioned it becomes out dated before it’s really taken off. Charlie needs to be revamped for the kids it’s so sad seeing it all hidden away at the moment. There’s so much that could be done with the area and needs to be done soon!
The package is located in the "devel/p5-Data-Page-Pageset" directory. The current source version of the package is "p5-Data-Page-Pageset-1.02nb2". For a summary on how to use the package collection, go to the top of the packages tree.
OpenBSD/sgi runs on most 64 bit MIPS-based SGI servers and workstations. OpenBSD/sgi is a fully featured 64 bit port and will thus only run on systems based on 64 bit processors, i.e. R4000 and up.
The OpenBSD/sgi port has its roots in the OpenBSD/arc port created early in the OpenBSD history. ARC support was rather soon discontinued due to the lack of interest and availability of decent hardware.
Eventually SGI hardware became more affordable and obtainable, and interest for an SGI port in the tree increased. The final piece, a working 64 bit toolchain, eventually became available and allowed the 64 bit SGI OpenBSD port to appear in 2004.
Hardware support was initially limited to the O2 workstations. Efforts to port to more systems did not really start until 2008, where the first Octane support parts were introduced. This work was completed in 2009 with support for Origin family systems as well, allowing OpenBSD to be the first free operating system to run on the Fuel workstations, and even later, also on Origin 350 servers.
The earlier generation of R4000 Indigo, Indy and Indigo2 was not forgotten either and support for it appeared in 2012. This paved the way for R8000 and R10000 POWER Indigo2 support as well.
OpenBSD/sgi runs in 64 bit mode and boots multi-user on supported systems. Snapshots are made periodically as the port develops and expands.
All graphics options but the IP27 Kona frame buffer should be supported; on such setups the kernel will be limited to serial console operation only.
Origin 2000 and Onyx 2 are not supported yet. Single-node multiprocessor operation is supported on Origin 200.
R5000, RM5200, RM7000 as well as R10000 and R12000 processor options are supported, including the RM7000 level 3 cache.
Origin 300 and Onyx 300 are not supported yet. Single-node multiprocessor operation is supported at least on Origin 350.
Note that Octane 3 and Origin 400 systems are completely different architectures based on x86 processors, and as such are not supported by OpenBSD/sgi.
Broadcom BCM57xx (a.k.a. Tigon3) bge(4) 10/100/Gigabit ethernet (this is the on-board interface found on Origin 350 and Tezro).
Octane and Origin family iockbc(4) PS/2 Controller found on ioc(4) IOC3- or iof(4) IOC4- based I/O boards (such as IO9 and IO10).
Snapshots are made available from time to time, in this location as well as on a few mirrors. Here are the OpenBSD/sgi snapshot installation instructions as well.

God wants you to study the Bible. The Bible is God’s Word. Without the Word of God, you cannot be saved. We are SAVED BY GRACE THROUGH FAITH-ref Eph 2:8. God’s Word also tells us, FAITH COMETH BY HEARING, AND HEARING BY THE WORD OF GOD-Ro 10:17. It is by hearing God’s Word that faith comes. Our faith must be centered on Jesus Christ. We must have faith that Jesus is the only begotten Son of God; that Jesus Christ (the Messiah) is come in the flesh; and that He died on the cross for our sins. It is only through Jesus that we can gain entrance to heaven. Satan will do everything possible to keep a person from their Bible; for through the Word of God comes faith that enables us to stand against Satan.
Many churches today do not encourage their members to bring their Bibles to church. Some actually discourage people from bringing their Bibles and even from reading them. These are false churches. Their leaders are the blind leading the blind. It is recommended that you run from such a church. As it is written, COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE-Rev 18:4. These blind leaders of the blind do not understand they are doing wrong. They are fully convinced they are doing God’s will, even though their actions contradict the Bible.
Many people have a difficult time understanding the Bible, so they shy away from reading it. This may be because they do not have God’s Spirit inside them, (they are not converted; they are not born–again). How do we receive the Holy Spirit? We are to believe and have faith in Jesus Christ. Then we are told in Acts 2:38-REPENT (that is, forsake all your sins), AND BE BAPTIZED (by full immersion) EVERY ONE OF YOU…AND YE SHALL RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST. Gal 3:27-FOR AS MANY OF YOU AS HAVE BEEN BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST HAVE PUT ON CHRIST. Baptism for babies and baptism by sprinkling are Satan's counterfeits. Before being baptized by immersion, you must believe on the name of Jesus and be willing to forsake all sin (REPENT). When you have difficulty understanding the Bible, ask God to help you and give you understanding. As we read, Jn 16:13-THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH…WILL GUIDE YOU. Jn 14:26-THE HOLY GHOST…HE SHALL TEACH YOU. Lk 24:45-THEN OPENED HE THEIR UNDERSTANDING, THAT THEY MIGHT UNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURES. Never approach the Scriptures with a “know-it-all” attitude. Approach God with a humble attitude. Become as a little child before God. God hates pride. It is an abomination to Him. How can God reveal things to people who are wise in their own eyes? It is written, Mt 11:25-THOU HAST HID THESE THINGS FROM THE WISE AND PRUDENT, AND HAST REVEALED THEM UNTO BABES. Job 17:4-THOU HAST HID THEIR HEART FROM UNDERSTANDING.
The Scriptures were written by about 39 authors, dating from about 1900 B.C. to about 90 A.D., yet they harmonize perfectly. There is not one contradiction or mistake. There are about 10,385 prophecies, and every single one has come true up to this time without one exception. It is written:
Satan will try to keep you from the Word by using things like cares of this world, deceitfulness of riches, pleasures of this world, lusts of other things, persecutions, and temptations. Turn off the music. Put down the newspaper. Read your Bible. Forget the party, the date, the movie, or visiting with relatives. Put God’s Word first in your life.
Do you study for school? Do you study for college? Do you study for your job? Can these save your soul? When do you study God’s Word? If you think these things are more important than God’s Word, then you are deceived. Anything that comes before God’s Word is an idol
In Acts 20:32 we read, BRETHREN, I COMMEND YOU TO GOD, AND TO THE WORD OF HIS GRACE, WHICH IS ABLE TO BUILD YOU UP. If you are born-again, you should have a thirst for God’s Word. If that thirst is not there, perhaps you should examine yourself to see why.
If you have truly been born-again, you do desire God’s Word. If you have tasted (if you have the Holy Spirit) you will desire to read the Bible, for you can only grow through God’s Word. If that desire is lacking, you need to examine yourself in light of God’s Word to find out why. If God is not the most important thing in your life, then you need to examine yourself to see if you are really in the faith.
Every true Christian is a disciple (disciple means pupil). If you are not a pupil of Jesus, you are not born-again. You are not saved.
Jesus says here, IF YE CONTINUE IN MY WORD, then you are My sheep, My pupils, My brethren, My disciples.
If you have not continued in God’s Word, then how can you stand on God’s Word to say you are saved? If you do not desire the sincere milk of the Word, how can you say you are born-again? Let God be true and every man a liar-ref Ro 3:4.
Jesus said in Mt 4:4-MAN SHALL NOT LIVE BY BREAD (or food) ALONE, BUT BY EVERY WORD THAT PROCEEDETH OUT OF THE MOUTH OF GOD. Are you? You say, “Am I what?” Are you living by the Word of God, by the Bible?
God’s Word says Lk 6:46-AND WHY CALL YE ME, LORD, LORD, AND DO NOT THE THINGS WHICH I SAY? You are to live by the Word of God. How can you live by the Word of God when you don't study it?
Verse 6-AND THESE WORDS, WHICH I COMMAND THEE THIS DAY, SHALL BE IN THINE HEART. God is commanding you this day to love Him and study His Word, to meditate therein day and night.
Here are some tips on reading your Bible. Begin reading the Gospel of John. Read it through completely, three times. Never read less than five chapters per day. More would be preferable.
Next go to the book of Matthew at the beginning of the New Testament. Begin reading from there, all the way through to the end of the New Testament, including the Revelation. Read the New Testament through completely, three times.
Once you have read the New Testament through three times, then go to the beginning of the Bible and read the entire Bible through completely, from Genesis 1:1 to the end of the Revelation. Remember, read at least five chapters or more per day, which will be at least thirty-five chapters per week. More than this is better.
It is extremely important for a Christian to have a good overall understanding of the Bible. Many people wrongly study the Bible, a little here and a little there. As a result, they never really have a clear, overall view of the entire Bible. They lack a good, biblical understanding of God, of God’s judgments, and of how Satan deceives. This gives a place for the devil to deceive them. It is highly recommended that a person read the entire Bible through at least once every year.
Thus, in just 58 weeks a person will have read the Gospel of John a total of 7 times, the New Testament a total of 4 times, and the entire Bible 1 time.
From this point on, a person should continue to read through the entire Bible at least once a year. Reading 5 or more chapters per day is essential for the born-again Christian that wants to follow Jesus (the Word of God).
Other types of specialized reading and study are definitely not recommended until the previous program is accomplished.
Studies such as these are not recommended until after the beginning program of reading John, the New Testament, and the entire Bible has been accomplished.
The Bible can be broken down into subjects. Key subjects that should be considered, include doctrines as outlined in Hebrews 6:1,2, such as: believing on Jesus, faith toward God, grace, repentance from dead works, baptisms, laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgments. Other more specific topics may include: sin, pride, humility, childlikeness, the tongue, witnessing verses, forsaking everything, serving God, fasting, fruits, a born-again attitude, fear, how Satan deceives, denying self, making excuses, idols, the Trinity, being content, doubt, prayer, warnings to take heed and beware, how to fight the good fight of faith, marriage, what God expects of a husband or wife, the role of women in the church, elders, and many others.
The Bible can perhaps be broken down into well over 600 subjects. One might begin this type of Bible study by making a list of all the subjects they want to include. List one subject for each sheet of paper. Put the papers in alphabetical order.
Then begin reading the New Testament. As you come to a verse that deals with that subject, write it out on the paper that has that subject listed. Three by five inch index cards are especially useful. Write just one verse on each card. These can be made into a card file. It may take some years to break down the entire Bible into subjects this way, but the result can be very rewarding.
If you have a Strong’s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, choose a particular word. Then turn to it in the concordance and find all the Bible verses listed under that word. Write them down on paper or index cards as described in the previous heading A Study of All Subjects.
The best way to study a certain topic in the Bible is to consider every verse in the entire Bible dealing with that topic. For example, if you want to study “water baptism,” research every verse on it in the Bible. This should hopefully give you a fuller and more accurate understanding.
This involves beginning at Mt 1:1 and reading to determine what verses to group together. For example, Mt 1:1 to 1:17 might be labeled “The Genealogy of Jesus Christ.” Mt 1:18 to 1:25 might be labeled, “The Birth of Jesus,” and Mt 2:1 to 2:12 might be labeled, “The Wise Men.” In the Revelation, the following titles might be used, Rev 1:1 and Rev 1:2, “Introduction to the Revelation of Jesus Christ,” verse 3, “Blessed Is He That Hears and Keeps These Things,” and verses 4 to 8, “Grace to the Seven Churches.”
Once you have done the entire New Testament this way in your Bible, then go on the Old Testament. As you do such studies, your wisdom and knowledge should continue to grow. As each group of verses are labeled in your Bible, you may want to separate them with a colored pencil line.
Colored pencils usually work very well. If a regular pencil is used, use a number 2 ½ lead. This seems to hold up best. It is better not to use ink, as it can smear. Over a period of time, it also tends to “bleed through,” spoiling your pages.
This Bible study involves labeling your Bible and grouping the same verses from the 4 Gospels together in the order they happened. It even includes dating the verses as to the approximate time the events took place. This sort of Bible study of the entire New Testament can be extremely rewarding in knowledge.
Try to read a book of the Bible through quickly in one sitting. You might make some notes for yourself of what seems to be the central theme. The next day read one chapter quickly. Again, make some notes as to what the central theme of this chapter seems to be. Now, the same day, read the same chapter again slowly and underline key words in each verse. Try coloring in key verses. Consider placing an “X” by the side of special verses. Put a few key words from that verse in the side margin to help you easily locate it later on. Post reference verses in the side margin. Some such verses might be Jn 1:1 and 1:14, which go nicely together; also Jn 3:3, 3:16, and 3:17. Try to study a minimum of a chapter a day in this fashion. This includes speed reading it, followed by careful consideration of each word in every verse of that chapter. Don’t get too carried away in coloring in so many verses that you can’t locate the most important ones. You might like to keep notes in a loose leaf notebook. You may consider keeping a note pad and list (by writing them out) of the key verses for witnessing. Some good examples are: Jn 3:16; Jn 3:36; Acts 2:38; Ro 10:9-13; and 1 Jn 1:9. Once you have finished reading and studying the book of John, go to the book of Matthew. Do this Gospel the same way. As you read it, watch for recurring words. You might like to underline them. An example is 1 Jn chapters 3, 4, and the beginning of chapter 5. Color in the words: YE KNOW or WE KNOW, each time they appear. Now study what God is trying to tell you. Go book by book through the entire New Testament. Do not shy away from the Revelation. Do this one the same way. In reading the Old Testament, try to speed read it all, before doing an in-depth study of each book. These are some tips that may help you.
This type of Bible study involves starting at the beginning of the New Testament or Old Testament. As you begin to read, put a slash or colored pencil mark after each group of words. Do the whole verse. Then study each group of words intensely. Mt 1:1,2 and 2:1 are marked here as an example.
In doing this, your study should carefully examine every single part of every single verse. Your knowledge should grow. Hallelujah!
1-Now when Jesus was born/ in Bethlehem/ of Judaea/ in the days of Herod/ the king,/ behold, there came wise men/ from the east/ to
There are other ways to study also. It is recommended that you seek God earnestly in prayer, as to what He would have you do regarding studying.
Nevertheless, we recommend that you continue to read through the entire Bible at least once each year. In addition to your reading, do various Bible studies as God directs.
The closer you get to God, the more humble you should be and the more childlike to God’s correction you should become. Any sort of pride is a good indicator that you are getting further from God, not closer to God. Consider carefully.
If you have a cassette player, listening to God’s Word on cassette can be very edifying; however, just listening to God’s Word is not a substitute for STUDY.
Memorizing can be very helpful to a person in witnessing; however, straight reading through the Bible and Bible study should never be forsaken for the sake of memorizing. Reading through the entire Bible as outlined in the first part of this message is essential. A person NEEDS a good knowledge of the ENTIRE Bible.
Thereafter, Bible study should be added to straight reading. Studying God’s Word is also needful. Thirdly, if a person has the time, memorizing can be added to straight reading and study; however, straight reading and study should not be given up for the sake of memorizing.
Some people have a very good ability to memorize. Others have a more difficult time. Some can study a verse for a few minutes and memorize it. Others may have to take several days of going over it and over it in order to memorize it.
Some teach to memorize single verses. Some teach to memorize whole chapters or books. Both approaches can be very helpful.
Some such chapters are: John chapter 3; Romans chapter 6; Matthew chapters 7, 18, 24, 25; Mark chapter 4; Luke chapters 12, 14, and 16; John chapter 15; Romans chapters 8 and 12; Eph 6; 1 Thes 5; 2 Thes 2; all of James; all of 1 John; Rev chapter 3; and others. Verses relating to a certain topic can also be combined and then memorized.
A person should write the chapter he is memorizing on a large paper. Try memorizing one verse a day if it is difficult, or two if it is easy. Each day thereafter, go over the verses you have memorized, and each day add another verse. After perhaps two months of going over these verses every day, reciting without looking, it should be well-embedded in your memory. Thereafter, continue to go over them once every two days, gradually decreasing how often you practice, down to once every two weeks.
After a long period of time, you may have memorized many chapters. It may take a lot of time to quote them. As you continue, you should find you can quote a chapter very quickly, which is helpful if you have many to cover. On Monday, you may quote 5 chapters when going over them. On Tuesday, five others, and so on. Should you not continue to go over the chapters on a continual basis, you begin to lose them. It’s not recommended that you begin memorizing on a large scale, until after you have spent a considerable period of time building a solid foundation by reading and meditating upon God’s Word, perhaps two or more years.
Remember, when reading, studying, and memorizing God’s Word, Satan can be expected to fight you in many unexpected ways to try to stop you.
One Bible study aid you might like to acquire is a Strong’s Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible. That is all.
Some people like to learn from all kinds of books about the Bible. They may buy all kinds of study helps. It seems in this generation, most people are more familiar with other people’s opinions than they are with what the Bible actually says. It is far better to read your Bible, and let God’s Holy Spirit speak to you. When a person does not follow this advice, often-times much confusion sets in. Satan gets a foothold. Beware. You cannot say you did not know.
It is the same with regard to listening to many other preachers. This is the generation of deception. You can listen to one preacher on the radio, and he will say that the Rapture comes during the middle of the Tribulation. Another may say at the end. Another may say after the Tribulation. Another may say, there will be no Rapture at all. God forbid! People that listen to lots of preaching on the radio or television, may become very confused. God is not the author of confusion.
Satan can be expected to move in to try to cause confusion. Do not give any place to the devil. Stay in the Bible, and stay away from others that might confuse you with misleading information put forth in their books or broadcasts. Satan wants to compromise the truth. He did so with Eve. If you give Satan the opportunity, you can expect he will also do it to you.
Commentary Bibles are not recommended. The reason is there are certain passages in all of them that have been misunderstood. If you get drawn into deception on a certain verse because of a commentary, it is often very difficult for the Spirit of God to correct you, as you have preconceived thoughts. Always approach God’s Word with an attitude of, “Lord, I don’t know. Teach me.” Remember, studying God’s Word begins on your knees in humbleness.
If you turn to God for understanding and knowledge, you will come out much further ahead. Be careful of those that try to tell you certain verses don’t mean what they say, or that only certain parts of the Bible are for today. Take God’s Word literally. Consider acquiring a good King James Version (KJV) Bible. Remember, Ja 1:22-BE YE DOERS OF THE WORD, AND NOT HEARERS ONLY, DECEIVING YOUR OWN SELVES.
There are many different English translations of the Bible. Though many of these often provide for easier reading, no translation has been found to be more accurate than the King James Version (KJV). While the KJV may seem old-fashioned and more difficult at first, after spending time with it, it becomes as familiar and easy to understand as any translation.
When it comes to ease of reading versus accuracy, the accuracy of the text is far more important. This is why the KJV Bible is recommended above the others, when studying subjects such as Bible prophecy.
Some Bibles are not translations, but interpretations or paraphrased versions of the Bible. Such Bibles include the Good News for Modern Man and The Living Bible, and others. These are not recommended at all.
Some that have studied Greek or Hebrew at Bible college may state that certain words in the Bible mean something other than what is written. Though they may have good intentions, this can sow doubt and confusion in the minds of those listening or reading their materials. One may say a certain word does not mean what it says in the Greek or Hebrew; two or three others may come along that have also studied Greek and Hebrew, and say that it means something else entirely. In some cases, such things have overthrown the faith of others. Beware of any one that continually does this. Occasionally referring to the Greek or Hebrew may be helpful when offering a simple clarification or perhaps a deeper insight into a verse, but it should not greatly alter the meaning or harmony in which the Scriptures were written. Remember, the Bible was written so that even a child could understand.
They have a very big disadvantage. If they want to follow Jesus, they should make every attempt to learn to read. They have NEED to read the Bible.
With the exceedingly deceptive preaching that goes on in most churches, it is nearly impossible for such a person to stand firm in the faith in this generation. Two hundred years ago, the Bible teaching in the good churches had much more Scripture. Thus, an illiterate person would at least hear lots of God’s pure Word when they attended church. It is not this way today in this latter day generation. How can such a one turn to God’s Word and learn what God’s will is for their life or look up verses on how Satan deceives or on other subjects? How can they study to show themselves approved?
The Scriptures on cassette tape are a wonderful asset. A person, whether they read or not, can listen to the pure Word of God day after day. These are highly recommended. Alexander Scourby’s are probably the most popular.

These headphones do not have speakers and, therefore, cannot be connected to an audio source.
These headphones are ideal for sportsmen or craftsmen where ambient noise levels can be damaging. These headphones may also be helpful for people living with tinnitus or autism. The HP-25 headphones provide 25db of sound isolation which is very helpful for anyone sensitive to loud noises.
The headband is adjustable allowing children as young as 4 or 5 years old to be able to use these headphones.
The manufacturer provides a 1 year warranty on all of their headphones. The terms are simple. If anything breaks, and it’s not intentional damage, they will fix it for free. After 1 year they still offer low cost replacement parts if you ever need to repair your headphones.

Well I didn’t feel like posting all these yesterday, but I figured I might as well just in case someone had any interest in non-terrible youtube quality views of the UI and ingame what-nots.
Well, it came as a surprise to me, but there was a stress test scheduled today from 11am to 6pm PST for Guild Wars 2. I managed to get on and make the 3 classes I wanted to try, Mesmer, Necromancer, and Guardian. I started out playing the Mesmer first, and instantly fell in love. You start out with a sword, which was odd to me, but hey, I went around beating things down with it no problem, not to mention with a pretty purple glow effect to boot!
I decided to make a video for each character while playing them, nothing to special, and a lot of failure, but here it is none the less for Mesmer!
I had a lot of fun playing the necromancer, mostly when I would get knocked down and do like 5x more damage than I was when I was live, no big deal…anyway here is the necromancer game-play video!
That’s pretty much it, I didn’t really have time to play to much else, although I did make an elemetalist to mess around with, but by then the stress test was starting to have issues so I just called it a day.
Well this wasn’t really meant to be much of a post, as I didn’t have much time to prepare, but I wanted to at least share a little bit of my initial experience with Guild Wars 2. It should hopefully turn out to be a really great MMO!
As I stated in a previous post, Deer and I have been playing a bit of Guild Wars in order to get some cool unlockables in Guild Wars 2, when that finally comes out.
We’ve been at it for a bit, and we’re both doing pretty well. So far I’m at 38 out of 50 points, my goal, for obvious reasons, being the title reward of “Legends of the Mists”. Deer is a little bit ahead of me in points, but I refuse to accept that it’s because she is better than me, so I chock it up to her having played the game longer than me!
We started out pretty well, we had a lot of help from people in world, surprisingly, after playing many other MMOs, are actually quite nice and helpful. Deer the money bags had a decent supply of ‘Globs of Ectoplasm’, which are an alternative form of currency in Guild Wars.
So we set off trying to get the easy ones, armor, weapons, pets, the easy stuff. I still need 1 more set of armor, and some pets for a few more easy points, and to get around to getting our heroes their Hero armor for those points. I figure once we both get those points, we’ll be at 43 points, and then we only need to gather a few titles. I’ve been working on Hard Mode dungeons as well, got a pretty good hero comp that works for almost every single hard mode.
My Hero group, 3 Mesmer, 2 Necro, 1 Rit, and one Smiter Monk. I sometimes add a pure healer when needed, which is rare.
As Guild Wars 2 gets closer to release I suspect I’ll be playing a bit more as well. I know Deer’s mom, aka Afternoon Songbird, is trying to get 30 points (and last I heard, has 30 points), as she loves to play games with us. I had never played Guild Wars until these last couple months, and I wish that I had. It was pretty fun playing in both groups, and by myself with my own Hero groups. If anyone would like to get down sometime, I’m in-game as Fully Operational most of the time, and rarely I’ll play my Ranger, Ethereal Hurricane.
I would suggest anyone seriously considering playing Guild Wars 2, at least give Guild Wars 1 a shot. The game-play wont be the same or anything, but the lore is rather interesting, and really easy to get into. (And even more fun when your B.F.F. is a nerd-gushing lore-master! )
So it has come to my attention that listening to Linkin Park is considered “emo”. I mean I listen to Linkin Park when I’m not emo so maybe I’m just emo all the time? Well anyway, I figured that can’t be true, and I think I found some proof!
So, not really sure what to make of this, but I blame Deer for FORCING me to listen to Britney Spears. Maybe I really am emo!
So after missing the first beta weekend due to my own idiotic ways (Deer can attest!), I decided to pre-purchase Guild Wars 2. I have been informed that there will be another beta weekend happening at the end of this month so I thought I would try the game out. I normally don’t really care to much about playing betas of games, but I figured I might as well try out the classes and see what one of the three I have in mind I like the best.
Anyway, this post isn’t much, just a quick update as I’ve had a few people ask me what I’ve been doing.
I’m sure Deer and I will be playing Guild Wars 1 from time to time to try to finish off our achievement points that transfer over to GW2. Hit me up on Ethereal Hurricane, or Fully Operational if you wanna get down!

During the last Ice Age, mammoths and mastodons roamed Florida. Today, fossil hunters like James Kennedy of Vero Beach, Florida find their bones. “I'm not a scientist,” said James in a recent interview for National Public Radio. “I just go out and dig up bones good. I'm good at finding them." But I’d contend that James is a scientist – a citizen scientist. Many people collect fossils. I like to think of these fossil hunters as “citizen paleontologists” and they can play important roles in scientific discovery. For example, one of the bones James collected is more than just a fossil. It’s also prehistoric art. An image of a mammoth is engraved on the bone. Scientists estimate that the engraving was made at least 13,000 years ago. It’s an important clue to how humans lived at the time. Several research projects are combining the skills and interests of citizen paleontologists with those of scientists in order to help us understand more about earth’s history and evolution. Here are a few examples of projects that are getting citizens and researchers working together and leading to scientific discoveries. … Read more

2016 US Women's Open champion Brittany Lang is one of the most naturally athletic golfers you will encounter on the course. Putting as much energy into her fitness of the course as she does her practice on the range, her game revolves largely around her athleticism, and a combination of visualization and feel regarding the shots she wants to hit.
While many golfers get caught up in the technical aspect of what they need to accomplish to shape draws and fades, the truth is that most golfers will see much more success understanding the goal of any given shot, and reacting to it accordingly.
In the video below, Brittany explains her process for hitting not only draws and fades, but also high draws depending on the situation.
For a low fade, the most important thing for Brittany is visualizing the shot, and reacting accordingly. She sets up with her feet and body aligned to the left of the target, and then focusing simply on not letting the clubface rotate through impact. She does this with the "chicken wing," keeping her hands ahead of the ball, and keeping her lead elbow from folding through impact. This holds off the clubface, and keeps it from rotating through impact.
For a high draw, you can see that she sets her feet up well to the right of the target, and does the opposite of the high fade. She swings out to the right of the target, and lets the clubface rotate through the shot so that the clubface is left of her club path at impact. She focuses on hitting down on the ball to get it up to her desired trajectory.
When it comes down to it, shaping the shot is all about the direction of the clubface in relation to the direction of the club path (and to a much lesser degree, where contact is made on the clubface). If the face is right of the path, the ball will fade. If the face is left of the path, the ball will draw.
Brittany, however, doesn't focus on these technical aspects. She focuses instead on the feel of the clubface, and being sure that her body simply reacts to the mental "video" she visualized in her head before the shot.
Next time you get a chance to hit some range balls, try working on various feels for the clubface through impact- hold off some and let the clubface rotate through the shot on others. You will be amazed at how the ball reacts accordingly!

(1) That the broad framework for joint implementation of "Supporting People" between Hampshire County Council and the eleven District Councils be approved, subject to the need for each member authority to agree the proposals;
(3) That the Association nominates five District Members to serve on the Panel, at its Annual Meeting on 1 June.
"Supporting People" is a Government programme which brings together funding for people living in various types of supported housing. New "ring-fenced" Government funds, amounting to £0.3m in 2001/2002 are being allocated to Hampshire authorities for a development programme leading up to the planned implementation date for the new system in April 2003.
The new system, and the development programme, require collaboration between County and Districts. The Housing Officers Group, Social Services Department and Chief Executives’ Group have brokered a scheme which is currently being signed off by Members in each Hampshire authority.
This report recommends an overall management and review mechanism to ensure that Members "own" the somewhat complex arrangements which are intended to lead to a better quality of life and greater independence for vulnerable people.
1. Hampshire County Council has prepared the detailed proposals for "Supporting People" in Hampshire in close consultation with:
2. The Chief Executives’ Group has considered various options for implementation. Funds available to individual District Councils are in the region of £20,000 each (see Appendix 1 of the Annex). Put together with Social Services funding of £116,000, these funds give sufficient to implement the new system in a co-ordinated way and provide new staff - bringing in a new system - the chance to work together as a team and develop a successful process for implementation in 2003.
It is considered that for the year starting April 2001, six staff can be deployed across Hampshire, working for the District Councils in four basic groups:
In subsequent years it is planned to move to a position where larger Districts such as New Forest have their own allocated "Supporting People" member of staff.
3. Funding is proposed to be centralised, with the County Council technically employing all the staff, but the District Councils having control over local arrangements.
4. It is proposed that a joint Member/Officer Steering Group be established to oversee implementation of "Supporting People" in Hampshire. This Steering Group would represent:
With 11 representatives in total, it would be possible for each District to be represented. The Group would be purely advisory. Executive decision would remain with individual authorities. However the Steering Group would provide:
* an important "sounding board" for the County Supporting People Manager (see page 13 of the Annex, where the Steering Group is shown as the "County Core Group").
* a method for District Members to see that District Council aims are being achieved at Hampshire level.
"The online training on cultural awareness was straight to the point, provided helpful examples and enabled me through understanding cultural differences to work with my clients and colleagues more effectively."
"Nadège has helped me build my confidence using her systemic coaching approach via Skype, it did not only impact me, but also the people around me. I cannot thank her enough for that."
"Nadège sincerely took interest in me as a person and tried to answer all of my side comments. She clearly loves what she does and is so passionate about helping others. It is not just “a job” for her."
"Nadege was excellent at demonstrating and explaining any questions asked in regards to understanding both cultures"
This week-end, after the results of Brexit, must have been a very difficult week-end for a lot of People, and I would like to share not only what I went through but what some of my fellow European and pro Remain British friends may have gone through too....
Hi all, We all have woken up with the sad news that the British public has voted to leave the European Union. We have to respect the public’s vote even if we disagree with it and trust that the UK has a prosperous future ahead...

Innovations are, by now, widely recognized as a key source of economic growth and as a useful instrument to face the competition brought about by the forces of globalization. Not surprisingly, innovations have acquired a crucial role in the growth and competition strategies of many firms, as indeed of many countries and economic regions.
A strong trend of internationalization of R&D and even globalization of innovation ("Global Innovation") may be observed across all countries actively participating in the global economy. Traditionally, there have been examples of R&D work by foreign companies in developed, industrialized economies. For instance, affiliates of foreign-owned firms spent nearly 3.5 billion euros on R&D in Germany in 1993. Latest figures (available for year 2013, released 2015) suggest that R&D expenditure by affiliates of foreign firms in Germany had increased more than three-fold to 11.9 billion euros (22.6% of domestic R&D expenditure). Thus, almost one-fourth of R&D-spend in Germany is carried out by affiliates of foreign firms. This development has been, however, stagnating for some time, which is an interesting development. On the other hand, R&D spend by foreign affiliates of German firms has increased. They spent 17.3 billion euros on overseas R&D efforts , which constituted 31.3% of the total R&D budget of domestic MNCs. While Germany's pharmaceutical industry spends more than 52% of its R&D budget abroad, the automotive industry, now, also spends 22.6% of its R&D budget at overseas locations, up from 18.3% about 4 years back in 2009..
This phenomenon has also been spreading more and more towards "emerging economies" known for their scientific capabilities. This trend is reflected in the increasing number of offshore R&D centers located in emerging economies such as China and India and in the increasing number of patents granted to multinational firms on inventions made at such foreign locations, as a recent analysis (March 2012) by us shows. For instance, most of the DAX-30 firms in Germany that conduct in-house R&D, have established R&D presence in India, as a study of ours showed. The activities are often organized in the form of an offshore captive center, an international joint venture, a third-party offshore outsourcing contract (contract R&D), or a cooperation with academic and/or research institution abroad.
Under the aegis of Research Programme "Global Innovation" we seek to observe, analyze and forecast developments in the field of globalization of innovations. This programme is an initiative of the Institute of Technology and Innovation Management (TIM) at Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) and was launched in January 2007. It originally consisted of two major studies to understand the impact of Offshore R&D. In the meantime its scope has been extended to include trends like "Bottom of the Pyramid" (BOP), "Grassroot Innovations" and "Frugal Innovations". Additionally, we also monitor outward foreign direct investments (FDI) from emerging economies, especially in their technology-seeking aspects. India and Indo-German economic relations stand in a particular - though non-exclusive - focus of our studies at present.
30.03.2016: New publication: "Frugal Innovation in Scholarly and Social Discourse: An Assessment of Trends and Potential Societal Implications", authored by Rajnish Tiwari, Luise Fischer and Katharina Kalogerakis, a joint working paper of Fraunhofer MOEZ and TIM/TUHH as a part of the BMBF-ITA project.
Nov. 2015: Hamburg celebrated an "India Week", where TIM/TUHH is actively invloved. Among other things we co-organized a symposium on renewable energies in the Indian context. Also listen to a radio interview of our team with the External Services Division of All India Radio on the topic of "Indo-German Collaboration in Technology"

I would suggest to make a new Section of "Reviews"[/i] where anyone can submit their Spreadsheet, model or any other work for the review of other members. Where people can highlights the mistakes (if any) and make comments for improvements.
Like for example, i am doing a project and want second opinion from you guys. i am not facing any problem but want others to review the work anyway may be there is a chance of improvement or may be i made a mistake and it is not evident to me..... and if some one has the time and some one wants to reviews it .. fresh eyes always picks mistakes a lot earlier and easier.
Completing my point of view, I think that you could change the name, putting together the PROBLEMS and REVIEWS. (something like REVIEW/PROBLENS).
If we have a huge movement, in the future we could consider separate then! (or create sub-sections inside)
As the example of the post of ASUMI recently, my opinion is that a excessive number of sections causes more confusing than organization.
I feel in the last days something like aftershock (in earthquake terms) and less participation. For me the problem is the lenght of the first page (and I work in very high resolution).
My suggestion for Admin is: the main page will include only the main sections and every one will open in a new page. In the free space of the first page you must put a disclaimer about the use of software only for try and not for production and the rules in a more visible manner. I'm not sure the users don't read the rules because they are lazy or they don't see this row. In my vision the first page is like a gateway for the content.
We are not a small family today and I cannot send everybody private messages but sometimes giving warns I ask my self if the user is guilty or we didn't give him enough support.
I agree with BennyP on the index page. Sometimes I login to the forum with my mobile phone and with new long index page it takes time to check and roam.
Any content in the links of this post is for evaluational purposes and not to be used in any other way. If you don't agree that, you must not use it. If it's not free and you're using it in any other way than evaluational purposes, you have to buy a licence.
but you can minimize each section by clicking +, & have a small home page & enter each section that you wants by clicking its title,
anyway i will try to make smaller home page, but it need to change our script that i don`t have enough knowledge ...
The last posts at the bottom of page was important. This was the rapid way to identify the last posts and to see if need moderation. Now we need to search all posts.
The Board Statistics we can see at Forum Stats (Most replies and Most views) but the last post not and this one is verry useful. This is a must in every forum for founding fast without opening every section.
Let 2018 be a very special year for you, filled with pleasant events, enjoyable encounters and new achievements! Hope you have a truly amazing holiday season. May your most cherished dreams come true in the New Year, and may every day be filled with inspiration, love and warmth!

So I'm at home for a bit on the sunny Isle of Wight, taking a bit of a break from everything. There are some stunnng bits of countryside and you can really feel the freshness of the air
I'm currently planning a few projects and trying to figure out which ones I should give priority to. As soon as I have something to show, I'll put it up.
My lovely girlfriend Amber gave me her old camera, so there should be some more photos going up on this page soon.
In other news, I'm off to new york in may! There will be many photos and drawings to put up. The drawings will probably stay here, but I think I shall put the photos on my Dad's website which is over here ----> www.cheesybits.com which is well worth a poke around anyway.
I'm currently working on some new pieces that I can't wait to put up here, but in the mean time I thought I'd mention the great review the Forbidden Planet gave 'Tales from the Deep.' (The graphic novel I worked on recently with the Drawn Chorus collective)
That's all for now, though I'll be updating this page on a semi-regular basis with news, works-in-progress and sketchbook stuff.
Eyes on Net is pleased to offer complementary consultations to prospective clients. We will gladly walk you through our SEO services and methods, and together we will create a plan to increase visibility to your site.
Technology has become a vital part of our day-to-day lives today. As a matter of fact, it is safe to say that people nowadays use technology in over 60% of their daily routines. A very good example of a major technological change that has become a major part of everyone’s life is the internet. The Pope once referred to it as ‘the other universe’. He was right. Today you can get anything from the internet; from shopping to the latest music. There are millions of websites used for various purposes. The problem is getting your website to be recognized. This is where Search Engine Optimization (SEO) comes in handy. It is basically used to enhance the visibility of your website which in turn increases the traffic flowing into your website.
If you have a website, then using SEO is a must. Basically, SEO helps increase the number of people that visit your website. Think of it this way: the higher the traffic, the higher the rank of your website. This is the only way that your website can get recognition. Research has shown that most people only get to look as far as the second search listing page. The rest only come as by-the-ways. In that case, it is important to make sure that your website is in the first or second page for even more traffic.
On the other hand, being on the first two pages of a search result means that the users take the information you give them more seriously. This mainly implies to sales websites. People will go for your products just because you have a higher rank. They believe that your goods have a higher value for money than those sold by those with lower ranks. As a matter of fact, the use of SEO is one of the major strategies used by most of the highly ranked online shops.
In addition to this, SEO tends to improve the general structure of your website. Most people tend to think that SEO only helps at increasing the traffic and improving the rank of the web portal but this is not the case. Though indirectly, it also helps improve the structure by ensuring the content of your site is hundred percent relevant. In order for your site to find its way up the ranks, SEO requires one only to use relevant content through details such as the keywords used. This forces publishers to go through the content of the websites removing any unnecessary information and replacing it with the relevant items. At the end of the day, you find that your website is complete in such a way that its users are satisfied with the information you provide them with.
Lastly, technology is gradually changing and so is the SEO sector. A lot of changes are being made to improve on its efficiency. Sooner or later, it will become compulsory for one to use SEO for his or her website instead of waiting till the last minute. Why not start now and enjoy the benefits later instead of waiting, it might be too late by then!

You are here: Home / We are Gulag Bound / *Resisters' Log* / Diana West Fest, ‘Who Betrayed America?’
Diana West is an American national treasure. She makes the very relevant and totally valid point that Soviet communism was dictating US foreign and domestic policies during the 1930s and ’40s.
Diana West speaks a fundamental and basic truth. Her book American Betrayal: The Secret Assault on Our Nation’s Character is a must read.
West is correct and her critics like old Marxist turned “conservative,” Ronald Radosh, are completely wrong.
To push my own barrow, my own book The Enemies Within: Communists, Socialists, and Progressives in the US Congress, carries West’s theme into the modern era.
Not only does the United States face huge Islamic infiltration, but the communist infiltration of the ’40s was never rooted out properly and in many ways is even worse today.
The premise of the book is that communists have heavily infiltrated the US Congress and are dictating the laws that rule the lives of 300 million Americans. Today, not 50 years ago, but in 2014.

About the trajectory of this, we must pray, communicate, keep calm, and do not become the first to engage. If it comes to it, do not even respond in kind, until after the after the first times that extreme, anti-American violence is done by them. It calls for an attitude of self sacrifice -- first cheek, second cheek, then no more.
And speak out about the potential and strategic "sense" of the Obama/NWO's DHS carrying out false flag missions of violence, blaming it on American patriots, perhaps upon our militia movements.
We are in a real war, right now (of which others and I have been trying to alert fellow Sovereign Citizens for years) and the prime war is for the minds, hearts, and wills of the American People. We are opposed by an anti-American insurrection using any means of power (see Gramsci, Frankfurt School) including government power, as they are granted that opportunity.

In terms of conceits, John Done remained an invincible and unparalleled poetyr his conceits got refinement through experiential point of view and gave the references from every discipline of knowledge including science, religion and medicine.
His originality was one of treatment and technique; he forged a more rapid and brilliant short short essay on metaphysical poetry than any of his predecessors had done, and for brief intervals and along sudden paths of his own he carried English poetey to a higher refinement, a metapjysical glittering felicity, than it had ever achieved.
And there are several instances in which 17th-century poets used the word ‘metaphysical’ in their work, meaning that Samuel Johnson’s description has some foundation in the usage of the previous century. Done cannot be held illogical and absurd in defining love through conceits because he addressed the concept through the reality of love in a short essay on metaphysical poetry and similarly appalling way with the aid of the conceit of the compass.
He draws the material of his figure of speech from highly unpoetical sources. How about make it original? Academy of No Poets Educator Newsletter. Among his juvenilia appear imitations of Cowley.
Instead he was repeating the disapproval of earlier critics who upheld the rival canons of Augustan poetryfor though Johnson may have given the Metaphysical ‘school’ the name by which it is now known, he was far from being the first to condemn 17th century poetic usage of conceit and word-play. Unknown September 14, at 6: Essay specifically for you.
The poet evokes hush: The metaphysical poets were eclipsed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries by romantic and Victorian poets, but twentieth-century readers and scholars, seeing in the metaphysicals an attempt to understand pressing political and scientific upheavals, engaged them with renewed interest. Retrieved from ” https: Eliot did much to establish the importance of the school, both through his critical writing and by applying their method in his short essay on metaphysical poetry work.
It was from short essay on metaphysical poetry use of conceits particularly that the writing of these European counterparts was known, Concettismo in Italian, Short essay on metaphysical poetry in Spanish.
As you can see, the temptation to be merely clever must be hard to resist, while the difficulty in making such a conceit truly effective is quite considerable. In contrast, Vaughan’s images are more universal, or cosmic, even to the point of judging man in relation to infinity. October 10, at 5: The poet, however, manifests his beloved through the geometrical explanation as it is most vivid and persuading like one part of compass moves around and the other part revolves in central point and the two souls of lovers get freedom to roam in short essay on metaphysical poetry infinite vista of love and emotion.
A technique Herbert introduced was the ending of a poem with two quiet lines which resolve the argument in the poem without answering the specific points raised by it. Although in no sense a school or movement proper, they share common characteristics of wit, inventiveness, and a love of elaborate stylistic maneuvers.
He wrote many metaphysical poems following Donne. Views Read Edit View history. These poets were not formally affiliated and few were highly regarded until 20th century attention established their importance.
There is a question how could two people die by both fire and water? Anonymous March 14, at Mohammad Gouse Attar August 29, at 1: And you should, if you please, refuse till the conversion of the Jews.
Leave this field blank. Sahil Jaggi January mehaphysical, at His poetry shows that to a large extent he followed the lead offered by Donne, but he also made contributions which were quite distinct.
Metaphysical Poets made use of everyday speech, intellectual analysis, and unique imagery. Eman Gamal May 7, at Accessed October 27, At the end of the 19th century and in the beginning of the 20th century, interest in this group picked up, and especially important was T.
He affects the metaphysics, not only in his satires, but in his amorous verses, where nature only should reign; and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with nice speculations of philosophy, when he should engage their hearts, and entertain them with the softnesses of love.
It seems like every entrepreneur I meet these days is quick to proclaim themselves a visionary, expecting that will give more credibility to their startup idea, and improve their odds with investors. In reality, I’m one of the majority of investors who believe that startup success is more about the execution than the idea. Thus, unless the visionary highlights a cofounder who can take the vision and execute, I assume the worst.
It’s true that gifted visionaries bring many good things to an organization, including big picture ideas, seeing around corners, and a hunter mentality. Yet they also come with a set of shortcomings. These were outlined well, with some good recommendations for overcoming them, in the classic book, “Rocket Fuel,” by Gino Wickman and Mark C. Winters, both with a wealth of experience in this domain.
My bottom-line recommendation and theirs is that every visionary entrepreneur needs to be matched with a cofounder or key team member who has the required execution attributes. Let’s take a hard look at the key potential weaknesses of a visionary, and the value of an execution-oriented partner, which the authors call an integrator:
Staying focused and following through. Visionaries tend to get bored easily. To spice things up, they start creating new ideas and direction, which gets everyone excited. This may cause a wonderful 90-day spike in performance, but in the end often sabotages their original vision. Many projects get started but few are completed, and momentum is lost.
To compensate, every visionary entrepreneur needs to find a partner who gets great satisfaction from results, and loves the discipline of making things happen on a day-to-day basis. This person is the glue that can hold the people, processes, systems, priorities, and strategy of a developing startup together.
Too many ideas and an unrealistic optimism. Most true visionary entrepreneurs have unusual energy, creativity, enthusiasm, and a propensity for taking risks. This can be disruptive, as they love to break the mold. They often show little empathy for the negative impact this can have on capacity, resources, people, and profitability.
Again, the solution is a partner who is the voice of reason, who filters all of the visionary’s ideas, and helps eliminate hurdles, stumbling blocks, and barriers for the whole leadership team. Titles for this role in a startup are not fixed, but usually show up as president, COO, or chief architect.
Cause organizational whiplash. Due to founder visibility, the team is so tuned in to the visionary and current direction that every turn to the right to pursue a new idea turns the whole team to the right. The organization can’t keep up the pace of change, and soon loses motivation, productivity, and all sense of where they are headed.
Every organization needs a steady counter-force that is focused on directional clarity, and great at making sure people are communicating within the organization. Good integrators are fanatical about problem resolution and making decisions. When the team is at odds or confused, they need this steady force to keep them on track with the business plan.
Don’t manage details and hold people accountable. Visionaries typically don’t like running the day-to-day of the business on a long-term basis, and aren’t good at following through. Even communicating the vision itself can be quite a challenge, since it’s so crystal clear in their head that they can’t imagine having to repeat or clarify for others.
Balance here comes again from the operational expert, who is very good at leading, managing, and holding people accountable. They enjoy being accountable for profit and loss, and for the execution of the business plan. When a major initiative is undertaken, they will anticipate the ripple of implications across the organization.
Tends to hire helpers and not develop talent. Idea people are so bright that they don’t see the need to leverage the capabilities of others, or hire people smarter than they are in any given domain. They are usually too self-centered to see the need for developing skills and leadership in the other members of the team, or building a succession plan.
Here also the solution usually is a partner with prior experience, who has learned how and when to hire real help, and implement metrics and processes to measure results. They enjoy the coaching and development role, and are able to match work assignments to people’s strengths, promoting both people and company growth.
Of course, many will argue that the visionary entrepreneurs can simply fix their shortcomings, and thus save resources by satisfying both roles. But in my experience, very few entrepreneurs have the bandwidth to make this work, and the adapted entrepreneur ends up doing both jobs poorly.
I’m a proponent of capitalizing on your strengths, rather than focusing on fixing your weaknesses. If your strength is being a visionary, use that vision to attract a complementary partner, and make it a win-win opportunity for both of you.

Xcode 10 is a fantastic update to an already great piece of software for developing and debugging apps. Xcode allows you to easily create an iPhone app or a Mac app that you can launch and sell on the App Store.
Xcode 10 brings many improvements to the editor experience including multiple cursors, multiple selections, code folding, and enhancements to Playgrounds.
Error messages in Xcode have gone from unhelpful to extremely helpful with the latest release of Xcode. And if I ever do come across a strange error, searching on Google or StackOverflow has always pointed me in the right direction.
Xcode is vastly better than Visual Studio and other code integrated development environments (IDEs) because of several key reasons. Read on, so that you can understand what makes Xcode stand out.
Xcode 10 is far easier to use than Visual Studio, which is overloaded with so many buttons and hidden settings. In Xcode I can easily configure a project to work with FAT libraries (32/64/simulator/device), and in Visual Studio I have to manage every single library for 32 and 64 bit (and debug and release, which is a nightmare due to 4x the number of clicks drilling in/out of Visual Studio project settings).
Cocoapods and workspaces make it super easy to get started with an open source framework that allows me to stand on the shoulders of the giants in the iOS/Mac development community.
The Address Sanitizer and Thread Sanitizer have both helped me solve so many bugs that slipped through the cracks when I was working in C and C++ cross-platform code (Windows/macOS). Debugging threads on Visual Studio is a nightmare as the threads change randomly (as you step through code), while in Xcode it's effortless to follow and doesn't randomly jump.
I much prefer developing in Xcode than Visual Studio, even though I first started programming in Visual Studio 6 with C++ back in 2004. I grew up on Windows computers, and I didn't start using Mac computers until 2008. But now I can't go back to Windows. The experience and the development environment is better on Mac. (The only downfall is Mac gaming performance)
Apple understands easy-to-use software and manages to simplify complex tasks intuitively. The prominent "play" button is an outstanding example of why Xcode is easier to use. It doesn't overcomplicate the UI and provides a great development experience for starting your app right away. For contrast, take a look at Visual Studio and tell me what button, out of the 20+ buttons makes the project build. (Hint sometimes in Visual Studio it's not even visible!)
There are numerous issues, but every piece of software I use has bugs. Sometimes the bugs get in the way, but many times there are workarounds. Read the release notes.
I've heard that Xcode doesn't work well with large code bases (100,000+ lines), but since I'm only working on small apps, that hasn't been a problem for me. And there are probably ways to make large code bases work well and rookie mistakes that will make builds take forever. If you invest time in learning how to leverage Xcode's strengths and best practices that will help improve your daily development experience.
Right now I have around 19 bugs I need to submit for Xcode, so it's not bug-free. What I love about Apple is that they're far more responsive to bugs than they used to be. Many of my bugs have been resolved, and I'm not worried when I see a duplicate bug report, because I can now see (in Bug Report) when the original bug # gets fixed.
The visual designer in Storyboard files is extremely helpful at understanding how Auto Layout works (I'm writing a book on Auto Layout for beginners). In my apps, I use a mix of Storyboard files, .xib files, and programmatic UIs. Overall storyboards have been the best way to visually design app UIs that scale to the numerous retina displays in customer's hands.
In Storyboard files, there are some zoom and clicking quirks, but I look forward to Apple fixing these bugs. I'd love to get zoom support back in Mac Storyboard files, as right now I have to use the Accessibility Zoom to see the "pixels" I need to nudge around.
It would be nice to see Apple go through the initial "onboarding experience" to make it easier to get started. I find that there are a lot of "false positive" errors on the initial setup experience as you make your first app. Many times that means cleaning, rebuilding, enabling/disabling your development credentials, or restarting Xcode.
Playgrounds in the "Manual" mode feel far more stable than any prior version of Xcode. It was fun to write a little tool to pull down search ranking stats for my iOS and Mac apps using Playgrounds.
BUT, there are still some "indeterministic run" bugs with Playground so they can be hard for a beginner to use. They don't always run, and even sometimes will get stuck in an endless loop, preventing them from running the code.
The keyboard shortcuts don't always work to run the Playground — my workaround is to press the Play/Stop button in the bottom left corner. Hopefully, Apple will fix my bug reports and make Playgrounds even better for beginners!
I'm not sure if Apple's going to enable debugging in Playgrounds, but it feels like a missing feature.
Without debugging it's much harder to write the correct code, and with the frequent API changes as Swift has migrated the entire SDK, this has been a bit challenging at times.
My workaround when Playgrounds don't work is to use a Mac Command Line app to test Swift code, or a throwaway iOS project when I needed to check an iOS feature.
If you have a problem, submit a bug report to Apple with the expected, actual, and steps to reproduce the issue.

dealing with punk rock, speed/thrash and other music styles of the 80ies and beyond, a webpage connected to Red, Black & Green
En avant-première ( vous retrouverez l'intégralité de l'itw dans ARGYOPE)Anton, de PENTAGRAM CHILE!!!! 1)Why and how the return of PENTAGRAM Chile (after so many years)? Are you satisfied so far with the feedbacks? All of this started when we were working on a reissue of the demos which came out through Cyclone Empire Records. I was talking to different people and there seemed to be quite a bit of interest in the band so we booked a small tour of Europe and it went great. The feeling in the band was great. so we decided to try and record the album that we didn't get to record back in the 80s. At the time of typing this only very few people have heard the album, but the reactions so far have been awesome and everybody seems to agree that we really captured the vibe of the ld material. 2) Let's go back in the 80ies, how was Chile musically ( the different music scènes) then? Well, the media was dominated by pop/rock in Spanish language, but there were a lot of hard rock and heavy metal fans. There was actually a hard rock scene, but most bands just played covers, and when they played originals they weren't really good, so we started the band kind of as a reaction against all that. 3) What made you decide to pick a music instrument, learn to use it, and create a band? Which were your influences? My aunt used to be a piano teacher and my parents asked her if she would teach me lessons, but I got bored of it, so my mother got me a guitar instead. I started playing the usual acoustic stuff but soon I was playing along to Sabbath songs. My influences back then were probably Priest, Maiden, Sabbath, Metallica, Michael Schenker, etc. la suite dans ARGYOPE....

“ I see that your smarter than them. You let them come and watched me.” He says as I nod. I rush him hoping to beat his speed to no avail as he makes contact and flips me
I rotate and bring my body around as I kick him. He is able to deflect most of the damage but I hear his teammates behind me,” Damn you see that Little Foot is gonna take the kid gloves off now.” I look back dumbfounded, kid gloves? When the fuck was he using kid gloves? I turn and my stupidity almost cost me as he threw a punch and I had to duck it. I let loose with my own as I connect hearing a pop. Little Foot jumps back.
“ Thanks your pretty good. After this can we spar some more. I feel like we can be good for one another.” I asks as he smiles and nods. I hear another one
“ This isn’t a dating service kid. Find someone to fuck you on your own time.” The person says as I flip them off and answer
“ Your mom said she’d be on my dick in 10 minutes.” I respond as the oohhs and damns come while Little Foot and I swap blow for blow
About thirty minutes in we get in close for our hand to hand. I find that he can hit quicker, but not as hard about the same is true for me. About that time we both make contact stumbling backwards and I go to turn back, but he is a second faster as I feel his foot to the side of my head. I fall to the ground and I hear the count,”1…2…3…4..5..6..7“ I beg myself to get up but its to no avail,”8…9…10. and the winner is LF” I am finally able to sit up as I get to my feet, but stumble to quickly right myself. It goes dead quiet and I guess they weren’t expecting me to get up. I look at Little Foot and extend my hand
“ Good match bro. Next time though I’m gonna win.” I say as he takes my hand shaking it and I go to leave being the last loser
“ Yeah, but you took him one on one and almost beat Little Foot. He has like 15 blackbelts and none of us are stupid to fuck with him 1 on 5, but you went toe to toe and almost won. I say we take a vote. All those wanting Schoolboy to stay raise their hand.” Pol says as I watch as everyone raises their hand minus BW
“ Well majority wins. Your part of the team Schoolboy.” He says while I look back to ask something very dear to me
“ Nope, because you remind me of a snot nosed Schoolboy.” He exclaims making me flip him off before he continues “ Oh your my type Schoolboy so later baby.”
I look at him shocked as everyone laughs. I go and get fitted for my vest and clothes. I get a new ID and name. Even though I am eighteen I intend to drink with them. While I look at my new ID I see that I am listed as a twenty old year old and I smile.
While I got fitted I watched the men I was going to be teaming up with. There was Brian Johnson aka Politician or Pol. He was around 40, 6‘0, 205 lbs, short brown hair and brown eyes. Then there was Leland Scruggs better known as Brick Wall. He was a giant compared to me standing 6‘6, 264 lbs late 20‘s, shaved head and brown eyes, and a african american. He in a way reminded me of a mix of Nick and Adam into one man. His sense of humor was one only next to mine. The one I fought earlier was Michael Chen known as Little Foot.
He looked to be mid 20‘s, 5‘9, short black hair and brown eyes. He had speed and agility as I personally found out. He was lethal with his hands and feet. There was two that seemed to stand out though. Leadfoot and Drift. What I could tell in the short time of me being here was they were adrenline junkies. Hank and Benjamin Tyson both early 30’s, at 6’2, 225 lbs, with short blonde hair and blue eyes. They sat on the bench both talking about cars. I watched one cleaning his high powered rifle.
His name Larry Gunderson aka Long Range. He was the sniper of the team. Mid 30’s, 6’1, 215 lbs, shaved head with a tattoo of a skull on the back with hazel dark eyes. I was led out of the fitting room to another which I spotted a few that were cheering Little Foot on. He seemed seasoned looking to be early 30‘s also. He looked to be 5‘11, 189 lbs and fit, short brown hair and brown hazel eyes. He was talking to Jim Swartz aka $3ct10n8 I found out he was the team’s hacker and ears.
He seemed like your normal geek, but a tough geek. Mid 20‘s he stood 6‘0, 198 lbs, shory reddish auburn hair and blue green eyes. I pictured papa Tim in his spot chuckling inside. Then I was introduced to a guy that I guess was not at the fight because he ran in. His name was Fred Humpfreys nickname Blastproof. He was the team’s explosive expert. He seemed wired with a scarey chuckle. Looking early 20‘s, 6‘4, 234 lbs, short dirty blonde hair with blue eyes. I shook his hand before Pol took me out to meet the last member.
I am greeted by the one they call Grizzly Bear,he looks early 40’s like Pol standing 6‘7, 269 lbs, a brownish beard with short brown hair with brown eyes and he issues me a M4 and asks for my preference to a sidearm. I look through all the goodies at my disposal with this towering man just steps away from me.He reminds of those stories papa George would tell me of mountain men that would eat you if they were pissed off.
I decide then not to piss him off or the others. Grizzly Bear is the black smith and armorer of the team. The next week is training as a team in which I surprise my team and show they made the right decision. Grizzly Bear takes me under his wing and teaches me about gunsmithing and I find I like it. I completely tweek my 1911s and add compensators and basically made some sick ass guns. He shows me Pol’s present a Colt Peacemaker.
“ Hey Schoolboy I want you to finish this since it will be your graduation test in gun smithing.” He says to me getting a nod and I work on it anytime we are not practicing
It takes me a week before I’m done and Grizzly Bear checks it out. It passes his test and he gives it to Pol, but tells me to be quiet. Pol tries it out and is throughtly pleased.
Pol gives me this look of pure unadulterated surprise as Little Foot tells them that in another month or less I’ll be able to beat him. Leadfoot and Drift our drivers for the team tell him I scare them since I was on par with them if not better and that now we had a backup driver just in case. Each member tells him I far surpassed their expectations except BW
“ Your on. The loser has to run around the block naked singing the Spongebob Squarepants theme song.” He says as I agree and we shake hands
Two days later we are on the mission. We are sent after some cartel and we go in guns a blaze. I start counting my kills,”15, 20 , 32, 39“ as BW is always a couple behind me.
“ 10,15,25,30,35..fuck me I can’t let the noob beat me.” Brick Wall says as we all laugh clearing out the place
As I go into a room I’m surprised by some tweeker that slashes my face cutting me. I kick him into the door while BW comes around the corner carrying his M249 SAW and lets loose,
“ That’s another for me Schoolboy.” He says as I flip him off before we head to$3CT10N8 our techie. He steals the cartel leader’s money along with anything valuable. I look at them as they tell me its hazard pay. I nod knowing the less questions I ask the better. As get into the copter I ask Pol who won between BW and me. BW looks to POl who tells us over the headset.
“ Brick Wall confirmed kills…..75 and Schoolboy…….I’m sorry to say this.” Pol says as I look down defeated while BW starts his celebration before Pol continued “ Schoolboy had 77. Brick Wall you better make sure the cops don’t catch you.”
I look at my newest brother as he flips me off. I blow him a kiss before we share a brohug. When we get back Brick Wall strips and runs the block screaming out the song. He gets back and instead of putting his cloths back on he grabs a couple beers.
“ FUCK THEM BITCHES!” Everyone says in unison while we drink our pain away and I smile at my new family.
I’ve been with the team about a month and a half almost two and I’ve taken both Pol and GB as my surrogate dads. Pol has thought me how to channel my anger while Grizzly Bear has taught me all about being a gunsmith. I love taking the guns apart and tweeking them to make them fire faster or hit harder. Bear shows me a database of all the guns destined to be destroyed. I look and see quite a few I want and ask him about them. He clicks every single one I want and hits a code in before he turns smiling to me.
“ Ok Schoolboy your gifts will be here within the next week to ten days.” Grizzly tells me as I look at him. He tells me we can have anything and everything we want on the list as they are gonna be destroyed so them coming to us is no big deal
I tell him most I want for my own personal collection as my godfather George always talked about some of them. He smiles and tells me they are ‘for duty’ purposes not my own collection. I smile sadly as I nod.
“ I understand Bear. I just remember George telling me about the Colt Pythons and Anacondas and thought if I ever go back he’d love to hold one.” I say while he looks at me
“ So if you don’t qualify with them they become personal use only.” He tells me as I hug him and jump back apologizing
“ Your like a fucking kid in a candy store. If I don’t watch you this place will be filled with toys just for you.” He says laughing while I nod seeing some new additions and ask Bear to get them
He looks at me as I point to Desert Eagles in 50AE and tell him they’d be good for BW seeing him nod
He gives me my own password so anything I want I can get. I ask him how much the guns are and he tells me nothing just order what I want. I tell him we better expand. He laughs as he tells me to go see the fucktards. I go see Drift and Leadfoot and they tell me we need to practice my driving skills. I laugh and tell them they better have on brown panties.
They tell me I wish as I get tossed keys to some Crown Vic. I look under the hood and see the govenor gone and everything else looks stock. The guys tell me its a work vehicle not their toys. I jump in as they get in and I start going. We go around town not doing much as we talk. The boys were the last of their family because their dad was a alcoholic and when the mom divorced him he snapped and killed her, their aunt and little sister by burning them alive. The only consulation they got was the prick died as well. I nod as I see a undercover cop car and grin.
“ Hold on bitches we gonna run.” I say loudly as I slam my foot into the gas as I crank the wheel hard
As I pull the turn off I see the car light me up while we go racing through town around corners doing sixty. We hear on the police scanner,” White Crown Vic license number FUPIG5 heading East on Garner St. Driver is skilled and knows what he is doing.” I laugh as I remember George teaching my brothers and I how to drive. Nick and I loved the thrill of the turns and could drift like no tomorrow. Adam could never do it on purpose, but when he accidently did it he made me and Nick look like newbies. We pull a quick right as my pursurer loses control and slams into a bank. I hear the brothers cussing me out as we head back to base. I pull up and they both dive out kissing the floor.
“ THANK YOU OH HOLY SPIRIT UP ABOVE! SCHOOLBOY WE ARE NEVER RIDING WITH YOU AGAIN!” They both say in unison while I laugh as I ask what
“ They’re on their periods and I just royally fucked them.” I say and they turn to look back at him and answer back
“ No our whites became brown because Schoolboy decided to turn main street into the Indy 500.” They exclaim while I laugh again as they go to the bathroom making swishing noises. BW comments it smells like shit.
I laugh as I tell them what I did. Pol calls it a day while the guys want to go home. I nod and tell them I’ll sleep here since this place feels like home and I have my own indoor range. Pol nods as everyone, but Bear leaves. I grab my 1911s and a couple hundred rounds heading to the range. I practice doing single handed shooting, weak and strong. I also practice different positons and not focusing on my sights. I am killing it as I know no matter what happens I willl be ready. Bear motions to me with a beer and I nod. I empty the last of my mag before I go out and we talk.
“ Schoolboy why did you join?” He asks while I look at the older guy who has become a father to me as I sigh
“ You know I have a daughter?” He says those words I look at him since I always saw the picture of the little girl in his toolbox, but I didn’t want to ask while he continues,” When I was married to her mother I caught the bitch fucking my CO and doing a line of coke. I filed a divorce because I had photo proof and multiple guys that came forward, and told me they had been with her. I got full custody, but her mom pulled a chicken shit fucking move. She comes up to the house and I have my daughter behind me.
I tell her that Lisa isn’t going with her. Joanie my ex-wife pulls out a gun and then proceeds to blow her brains out. I stood there dumbfounded as I had watched my one time best friend kill herself and our daughter had to watch as well. My daughter was ten and told me she wanted nothing to do with me. I sent her to live with Joanie’s mom since my own parents had died. She would be about twenty now. I haven’t talked with her since then. She blames me for her mother’s death and she isn’t completely wrong”
I sit there and take in everything he has told me as I tell him about my family not wanting me, how my godparents took me in, and how I had graduated halfway through my senior year. I ask him if he can take a couple pictures of me.
“ Hey Schoolboy I love ya but I don’t like sausage.” He says laughing as I flip him off. I tell him they are for my god family.
He tells me to suitup and I do. He takes several pics and I laugh at each one. I look like I’m a action hero. I go over to $3ct10n8’s computer and put the memory card in and print off several 8x10s. I think back of my graduation disc and call him up. $3ct10n8 answers and I ask him if his computer could make a couple copies of my graduation disc. He laughs at what he considered a stupid question..
He tells me to put it in and open SDB and hit how many copies. I nod as I thank him and hang up. I pop the disc in and open the program. It fires up and I enter two discs and it only takes it 2 minutes to fully burn the disc and pops up, All copywrite codes have been removed. Enjoy your pirated disc. ;-)I laugh as I ask Bear to drive me to the local store to get some envelopes.
We get them and some more beer while we enjoy each others company. Bear drops me off as we talk for a couple more minutes and I head into HQ. I put the pictures into the envelopes and the discs into theirs. I write a letter home telling my god family that I was safe and I loved them. I congradulated my brothers on passing. I tell them I want to see them, but know that right now would not be a good time since my pain is still fresh.
Mom, Aunt Sarah, Kelsey, daddy, and I all got dressed up real nice. Dad has apologized for the things he said about Matt.We didn’t care because he has to be after some pussy. He does tell ud he is proud of Matt and even tells us he is gonna buy him a new car for graduation gift. We get to the field that graduation is going to be held at. Matty hasn’t talked to us in five months since Christmas. Adam, Nick and their parents keep saying they haven’t seen him. We walk in and see my god parents and wave.
Susan and Chelsea act like they’re better than us…fuck those bitches. I smile while we take our seats and I can’t wait to see Matty walk down that aisle as he becomes a young man. The principal talks about what today means and how each are taking their first steps into the adult world. He reads a speech from some unknown author about loyalty and respect and how love can drive you.
I feel so inspired as he finishes, but he doesn’t say who the author is. I chat with my family and they feel the same, but also wonder who wrote such a moving beautiful speech . I ask if anyone has seen Matty as I have kept scanning faces, but I don’t see him. Mom,and Kelsey tell me the same while Aunt Sarah cries praying the man she saw get on the bus wasn’t my baby brother. We comfort her while the principal starts calling names for there diplomas. We applaud when they call Daryl and Wayne’s names.
We all stand and clap when Adam and Nick was called because I knew Matty would be next as they were always together. Then the next name and it isn’t Matty. It’s Holly’s name as she makes her way. I see her head lowered and all the sudden I feel the guilt run through me. I look at Kelsey then at Aunt Sarah who looks sad. Other names are called after her, but no Matt.
We watch as they go through the rest of the class. The principal congradulates the seniors who played on the football team for their win at the national tournament. I keep wondering to myself as why Matty wasn’t there and where could he be. I look at my family and they have the same looks. I look over at my Aunt Chelsea and Susan who have tears coming down their faces, but smiles as well. The principal then calls Nick and Adam back to the stage.
“ I would like Nick Dakoson and Adam Everhart to please rise and come back to the stage.” He says and I watch as the two young men that I also considered brothers get up and come to the stage
I then notice that they have yellow armbands on as does the facilty and all the football players. The principal begins to talk again.
“ It is not customary to hand out diplomas to those who have graduated early, or taken GED, or High School Equivlency test, but this is a special exception. The speech I read earlier was from the young man whose diploma these two will accept. The young man’s name is Matthew Hartigan and he graduated in December. He chose to start his life a little earlier than his classmates. Matt was an exceptional student who was both loved and respected by those that knew him. He was both strong in physical attributes, but even stronger in mind and spirit.
Although he may not have walked with his friends and classmates I ask that he receives a hand as well…” He tells us and I hear clapping as I see my aunts stand and applaud. The rest of the bleecher stands to applaud my brother as we stand and join in while the principal waits for us to die down to continue,” Matt wanted me to offer some advice to his peers…love deep and never be afraid of the future. He also wished for me to to tell every one of you graduating tonight that he wished you the best of luck as he would have been your valedictorian if he had stayed.”
Hearing this I start to cry as the principal gives Matt’s diploma to Nick and Adam. They go to step down the football coach stops them.
“ Hello many of you may know me, but for those that don’t my name is Coach Rinnert and I coach the football teams. Matt was an exceptional young man and a better person off the field as he would help everyone from the star athlete to the little guy just starting. I have petitioned the school board and they have accepted my arrangement. This is the last year that number 30 will be used with the purple and gold.
Matt Hartigan was the perfect example of what it meant to be a Bulldog . He was a great person and had a never say die attitude. His nickname was the Army Tank with the Ferrari Engine. He was quick as could be, but god help you if you tried to stop him because you better bring an army. Nick and Adam, I ask that you accept Matt’s jersey on behalf of us and a proud community.” He says and I watch as Adam walks over and picks up Matty’s jersey before he turns it around to show us the name before he speaks
“ BULLDOGS FOREVER…FOREVER A BULLDOG.” He says with tears while the crowd responds because the Bulldogs had a fierce loyalty. After the ceremony ends my family and I rush to meet Adam and Nick and find out about Matty…….
“ You both lied to me. You knew exactly what happened to Matt.” Mom says while they all turn to look at her and us
“ First off the reason he left was because of you all.” Aunt Chelsea says getting shocked faces before she continues “ We don’t know what you all did besides not wanting him, but you hurt him badly. He graduated early just like the principal stated, but he went and joined the military.We didn’t find out until February when he called the boys.”
“ My mother isn’t lying. He did leave for the Army. We don’t know what it is will hebe doing but he left for his own reasons.” Adam says and I feel the sadness start to intensify
“ Nope as if he wanted us to know he would write or call telling us. He hasn’t called since that day though.” Uncle George says as my dad pulls out his phone
We all stand as Susan, Chelsea, Mom, and Aunt Sarah talk while Wayne and Daryl come over to Kelsey and I. Daryl places his arm around me and I feel disgusted for some reason. Wayne does the same to Kelsey while Nick and Adam look at us with disgusted eyes. I guess Daryl caught notice before speaking up.
“ Aww what’s wrong Nick and Adam are you both jealous?” He asks as Nick and Adam just shake their heads
“ Over what douche? If I remember correctly you and your boyfriend there got thrown through double plated glass.” Nick says as Kelsey and I look at each other before looking at Daryl and Wayne
“ Oh they never told you. Wow well let me bring you up to speed. Matt’s last day of school those two taunted Matt about you all. How they loved Matt’s family, and how you were glad he was hardly home.” Adam says while my eyes grow wide and he continued “ And for Matt’s own little revenge he planted both of them through the windows of the science room.”
I feel some kind of anger as these to idiots made fun of my baby brother. I hold my temper because I don’t want to cause a scene in respect of Matt. Since Christmas Kelsey and I have eased off giving them ourselves. We have been sleeping with Mom and Aunt Sarah. Kelsey and I only give dad, Wayne, and Daryl sex twice a week in which has gone down to once every week. I guess missing the one person that loved us was having a effect on us.
“ My friend said he would call back. Do you think we can go some where and talk to wait for his phone call?” My dad asks as George looks at Susan who just nods

The problem is that the Vista version of the Windows Installer does not assign your system account name to have write/modify access rights to the files or the installation directory. Instead it assigns two generic groups access rights of which only the "Administrators" group has full control and the "Users" group has read only rights.
Note: Just because you gave your system login account system admin rights doesn't mean you have real system admin rights. For lack of a better description Vista has levels of "system admin" and you don't have the God mode level rights like you did with XP/2000/NT when you gave your login account system admin. (Overly simplistic answer).
#2: The Windows Installer doesn't assign your login account the write/modify rights for the directory that the files are installed into. This also means that the server can't even create the needed log file when it's run from your account as is.
#3: Your system login account also will not have sufficient rights to install the service program. You will get an error saying "Unable to open the Service Manager" if you try doing the service install process.
This will allow your system login account to modify the INI file or any other files created in the same directory, which will happen as you run the program.
I'll be reviewing the Windows Installer scripts for the next major upgrade to see if this can be avoided.
The University of Nairobi and German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) have reviewed their partnership that has existed over 40 years.
This happened when the DAAD regional Director, Dr. Helmut Blumbach paid a courtesy call on the UoN Vice Chancellor, Prof. Peter Mbithi in his office on Monday October 31, 2016.
Dr. Blumbach said that German universities are interested in partnerships with Universities in the East African region. The East African region has recently had an increase in foreign investors and hence the education sector is also interested in partnering with top institutions such as the University of Nairobi.
Dr. Blumbach said that there is need for more detailed discussions to have a closer look at the doctorate study and possible areas of collaboration, joint initiatives, PhD supervision, quality assurance among others so that DAAD as an organization can give UoN specific German institutions to partner with.
Prof. Lucy Irungu, Deputy Vice Chancellor, Research, Production and Extension speaking on behalf of the Vice Chancellor, said that the University has benefited from this partnership; Capacity building, staff development and quality of the output has increased due to the scholarships that UoN has received from DAAD.
Prof. Irungu said that Internationalization is one of the objectives in the University’s strategic plan. The target is 20% of the student population to be foreign students. She said that UoN has many DAAD alumni and she welcomed the interest in expanding areas of collaboration and using this partnership to achieve the strategic plan objectives.
Dr. Blumbach said that internationalization is a great move and through the Kenya-DAAD Scholars Association-UoN Chapter, UoN and German universities can hold forums for discussions on how the University can achieve its 20% population of foreign students.
Prof. Enos Njeru, Principal, College of Humanities and Social Sciences (CHSS), Prof. Peter Ngau, Principal, College of Architecture and Engineering, among others were present during the courtesy call.

/r/cld/ - craigslist diaspora - general personals advice from casual encounters e real women looking for real contact with real guys in the world. The past 10 days, i have found myself immersed in craigslist’s “casual encounters” section — a forum for soliciting any type of sexual experience you may desire on the surface, it seems sketchy, and, like most people, i thought the site would be filled with less-than-attractive social rejects, 40-year-old virgins and disease. It was on craigslist personals that i happened to meet the only girl who i've ever been 100%, completely in love with - so i'm kind of biased to say yes" to this one. A review of the online personals at craigslist find out the positives and negative features of this dating site plus, see what singles have written about craigs list.

ERATO (pronounced AIR-uh-toe) is the Greek Muse of lyric poetry, including love poems and erotic poetry, and mimicry. The nine Muses are the daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, and they accompany Apollo in his role as God of the arts. According to one source, she has a son named Azan by Arkas, the King of Arcadia, while another source states that she is married to Malos, the lord of Malea, and with him has a daughter named Kleophema. Erato is usually depicted holding a lyre, and sometimes with a wreath of roses. Her name means "beloved," and her epithets include CLEAR-VOICED and WHO CHARMS THE SIGHT.
OURANIA (pronounced yu-RAIN-ee-uh) is the Greek Muse of astronomy and astrology. The nine Muses are the daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, and they accompany Apollo in his role as God of the arts. She is usually depicted holding a sphere in her left hand and a stylus in the right. Ourania is also honored by philosophers, lifting their souls to heaven by inspiring great thoughts. She is said to have had two sons by Apollo--Linos, who personified songs of lament, and Hymenaios, who personified wedding songs. Ourania's name, which means "heavenly," is also seen as URANIA.

A little over two years after he sold Letco, a high profile distributor of respiratory drugs and related products, to the Harvard Drug Group, he's running a technology company, Dream Software, and developing products intended to make HME providers more efficient.
"Everything we are doing here is built around one thing: We believe for you to survive long term, you have to generate more revenue and service more patients with less people," Letson said. "If you can't do that, you will never survive the next 10-year transition."
Letson acquired WDE Solutions in April and renamed it Dream Software. The company's first product, Dream Sales Tool, helps HME companies manage their sales teams and improve performance, allowing managers and reps to determine: average sales calls a day per rep; which programs generate the most revenue; seasonal selling opportunities; and much more, Letson said.
The company's second product, Dream Referral, should be out sometime this fall. It's designed to walk a physician through the DME prescription process to make sure it's completed correctly the first time.
"You can deliver or ship your products and bill the insurance provider the same day," Letson said. "There's no more chasing paperwork."
After selling Letco to Harvard, Letson stayed on as a shareholder and to help manage the company. He left Harvard last January.
"I told someone the other day that I stayed retired for about two months and just about went crazy," he said.

Captain John Smith was an adventurer. In 1596, at age 16, Smith left his home in England to fight against Spain in support of Dutch independence from the Spanish Crown. Two years later he signed on as a crew member of a Mediterranean merchant ship. In 1600 he joined Austrian forces fighting the Turks in Hungary. Captured by the Turks, Smith was enslaved and transported to Istanbul. He escaped by murdering his master, returned to Hungary and rejoined the fighting. Released from military duty with a large reward, Smith made his way back to England in 1604.
The twenty-five-year-old Smith soon grew restless. The Virginia Company had recently been granted a charter by King James I to colonize Virginia and Smith eagerly joined the expedition which left England in December 1606. The voyage lasted four months during which the abrasive Smith so irritated his fellow colonists that they placed him in irons. Arriving in Virginia in April 1607, the expedition leaders opened a locked box containing the names of seven men selected by the Virginia Company to govern the new colony. We can only imagine their shock when they discovered Smith's name on the list.
The inexperienced colonists struggled for their survival in the harsh environment they now called home. Disease, severe weather, Indian attacks, laziness, internal squabbling and starvation all threatened to destroy the colony. Smith's firm leadership (he was soon elected president of the colony) held the colonists together and narrowly avoided extinction. Wounded by an explosion of gunpowder, Smith sailed to England in late 1609 to recover. He never returned to Virginia.
He did return to the New World, however, as part of an expedition to explore Maine and Massachusetts in 1614 giving the area the name New England. His independence and abrasiveness disqualified him from any further royal sponsorship and he spent the rest of his life in England writing of his adventures. He died in 1631 at age 51.
The story begins when Smith and two English companions are ambushed by Indians. After killing his two companions, the Indians take Smith to their chief, Powhatan. After two months in captivity, Powhatan determines to have the Englishman clubbed to death in a ritual ceremony. According to Smith, the plan is thwarted only when the chief's daughter, Pocahontas (then aged 11 or 12), throws herself between him and his attackers causing her father to relent. Smith published his account of the incident in 1624. It is the only description of the event we have and some historians doubt its authenticity. However, the account permanently etched his name in American folklore. Throughout the account; Smith refers to himself in the third person:
"And now [1608], the winter approaching, the rivers became so covered with swans, geese, ducks, and cranes, that we daily feasted with good bread, Virginia peas, pumpkins, and putchamins, fish, fowl, and divers sorts of wild beasts as fat as we could eat them: so that none of our tuftaffety humorists desired to go for England
But our comedies never endured long without a tragedy; some idle exceptions being muttered against Captain Smith for not discovering the head of Chickahamania River, and taxed by the Council to be too slow in so worthy an attempt. The next voyage he proceeded so far that with much labor by cutting of trees asunder he made his passage; but when his barge could pass no farther, he left her in a broad bay out of danger of shot, commanding none should go ashore till his return: himself with two English and two savages went up higher in a canoe; but he was not long absent but his men went ashore, whose want of government gave both occasion and. opportunity to the savages to surprise one George Cassen, whom they slew, and much failed not to have cut off the boat and all the rest.
Smith, little dreaming of that accident, being got to the marshes at the river's head, twenty miles in the desert, had his two men slain, as is supposed, sleeping by the canoe, whilst himself by fowling sought them victual: finding he was beset with 200 savages, two of them he slew, still defending himself with the aid of a savage his guide, whom he bound to his arm with his garters, and used him as a buckler, yet he was shot in his thigh a little, and had many arrows that stuck in his clothes; but no great hurt, till at last they took him prisoner. When this news came to Jamestown, much was their sorrow for his loss, few expecting what ensued.
Six or seven weeks those barbarians kept him prisoner, many strange triumphs and conjurations they made of him, yet he so demeaned himself amongst them, as he not only diverted them from surprising the fort but procured his own liberty, and got himself and his company such estimation amongst them that those savages admired him more than their own Quiyouckosucks.
He demanding for their captain, they showed him Opechankanough, king of Pamaunkee, to whom he gave a round ivory double compass dial. Much they marveled at the playing of the fly and needle, which they could see so plainly and yet not touch it because of the glass that covered them. But when he demonstrated by that globe-like jewel the roundness of the earth and skies, the sphere of the sun, moon, and stars, and how the sun did chase the night round about the world continually; the greatness of the land and sea, the diversity of nations, variety of complexions, and how we were to them antipodes, and many other such like matters, they all stood as amazed with admiration. Notwithstanding, within an hour after they tied him to a tree, and as many as could stand about him prepared to shoot him: but the king holding up the compass in his hand, they all laid down their bows and arrows, and in a triumphant manner led him to Orapaks, where he was after their manner kindly feasted, and well used.
At last they brought him to Werowocomoco, where was Powhatan, their emperor. Here more than two hundred of those grim courtiers stood wondering at him, as he had been a monster; till Powhatan and his train had put themselves in their greatest braveries. Before a fire upon a seat like a bedstead, he sat covered with a great robe, made of raccoon skins, and all the tails hanging by. On either hand did sit a young wench of sixteen or eighteen years, and along on each side the house, two rows of men, and behind them as many women, with all their heads and shoulders painted red, many of their heads bedecked with the white down of birds, but every one with something, and a great chain of white beads about their necks. At his entrance before the king, all the people gave a great shout. The queen of Appamatuck was appointed to bring him water to wash his hands, and another brought him a bunch of feathers, instead of a towel to dry them. Having feasted him after their best barbarous manner they could, a long consultation was held, but the conclusion was, two great stones were brought before Powhatan: then as many as could laid hands on him, dragged him to them, and thereon laid his head, and being ready with their clubs to beat out his brains, Pocahontas, the king's dearest daughter, when no entreaty could prevail, got his head in her arms, and laid her own upon his to save his from death: whereat the emperor was contented he should live to make him hatchets, and her bells, beads, and copper; for they thought him as well of all occupations as themselves. For the king himself will make his own robes, shoes, bows, arrows, pots; plant, hunt, or do anything so well as the rest.
Two days after, Powhatan having disguised himself in the most fearfulest manner he could, caused Captain Smith to be brought forth to a great house in the woods, and there upon a mat by the fire to be left alone. Not long after, from behind a mat that divided the house was made the most dolefulest noise he ever heard; then Powhatan, more like a devil than a man, with some two hundred more as black as himself, came unto him and told him now they were friends, and presently he should go to Jamestown, to send him two great guns, and a grindstone, for which he would give him the county of Capahowosick, and for ever esteem him as his son Nantaquoud."
"Captain John Smith is Saved by Pocahontas, 1608," EyeWitness to History, www.eyewitnesstohistory.com (2003).
Jamestown's economic viability was precarious until the colony began to export tobacco to the Mother Country in 1613.
In 1612, Pocahontas was captured by the English and taken to Jamestown. She converted to Christianity, married John Rolfe and traveled to England in 1616. She met King James and unfortunately died of smallpox before returning home.

Amid the torrential rain within, and the jerky gusts of wind, in the darkest undergrowth of my sodden soul, I was surprised and then amazed and then stunned to find a candle burning.
This was not a candle I had lit or knew of; nor had I protected it against the downpour. It was just a candle I discovered, burning away without a care in the world.

This small patch fixes several script bugs, a CTD while dismissing a character in a city, diplomacy checks calculation and some potential errors in early game.
Two years has passed since the last update but. Can i ask you to upload the patch one more time, please?
with the same mod but an older version and also before all of that i copied udk`s folders into my off-road drive folder and i overwrited some of the files
sooo idk but i know that the editor mode of the game was not enabled without the patch if you do this correctly in the main menu on the bottom you get a debug window with 2 buttons 1 is editor 2 is console so yeah it has numbers 1and2 this is probably a built in editor that even the makers of this game dont know about .
not that i dont want to be happy that u might have found something but at the same time it does look pasted in.
Would you mind clearly typing out all the steps you took and where you obtained all the files. The more people we have working on this, the better. What version of the ZBL Patch do you have?
I am beginning to think this is a hoax. Do you have any pics of the map you created or any actual photos of you working in the editor?
i figured out that the game REALLY I mean LITERALY has its own built in editor all you need to do is go to google search for zed`s patch download that and then on the shortcut of the game right click->target and at the end add one space and add -editor works for me im happy I made my own flatmap and now im making it into a real crawling map also I will be editing the other maps so yeeeeeeeeeeeeeaah(the who) for the editor controls go to
Calling BS on this. I have already tried this, long before. The -editor flag has no effect on the exe shortcut. the editor (with no dash) flag does, but that is where you will get the error it is looking for the exe.config file. I have looked at the dll that comes with drzeds patch and it really isnt helpful.
To recharge I say, I want step by step instructions on what you did to get it to work, AND a video of you going into the editor, and creating a "flat map". OR a video of you playing ORD on the "flat map" you "created".
I do hope that you have found something but HIGHLY doubt what you claim to have found and be able to do. Waiting for your instructions and video.
anyway I am making a trainer so that even the noobs can do this stuff i will not give anymore instructions
he was blowing smoke. and it was just a paste on the main menu to make it look like he unlocked a editor,and if ne one here is a cheat happens unlimited member they have a trainer up and i know a few other sites do as well.
There are many different areas for improvement and the development team is working to make the existing game better by improving its core features. Currently the team is working on the patch to improve the game. It will be available soon, and the additional announcemnet will be made

Parisian dwellings can lack space, causing tenants to go without the comfort of a pet. Additionally, the cafe feels the concept provides more than just animal company.
“Purring produces vibrations which relieve arthritis and rheumatism, which lower your blood pressure and your heartbeat,” Margaux Gandelon, cafe manager of Les Cafe des Chats, told the source.
The cafe opened in September and has seen a positive response, with lines around the block requiring 300 people to be turned away the first weekend, according to the source.
Les Cafe des Chats takes extra steps to ensure the welfare of the animals that were adopted from rescue centers.
The cafe includes a tea room and restaurant where Habby, Djenko, Lovely, Oreo, Rosa and other felines roam around and greet patrons. The website features a reaction page where patrons can post their thoughts of the intriguing concept. Much of the feedback is positive and one cat lover was inspired to post a poem by the French artist Charles Baudelaire.

Joe Fitzgerald likes to be on the move. If he’s not peddling his bike, he’s often tooling around his New Scotland Avenue neighborhood on an unusual contraption known as an “Irish mail.”
The bicycle gives his legs a workout, and the Irish mail, a four-wheeled cart he propels by pulling on the handlebars in the manner of a rowing machine, keeps his arms strong and limber.
“The most boring exercise going is working out with weights, lying on your back on a bench, going ‘one, two,'” says Fitzgerald, 74, explaining the appeal of the quadricycle. “This way I can get my upper body exercise and my aerobic exercise simultaneously. On alternate days, I ride a bicycle.”
This week, Fitzgerald’s exercise hobbies bring him into the Advocate spotlight. His regular travel on both of his non-motorized vehicles has given the retired research biologist a unique perspective on a safety hazard that grows as bicycles increasingly share the streets with cars.
It’s a concern mainly related to bicyclists, but it started dawning on Fitzgerald when he was riding his low-slung quadricycle.
“Of necessity, I ride this on the sidewalks,” he explained. “It puts me so far below the line of sight of any driver that it would border on suicide to ride it in the street.”
Because Fitzgerald travels mainly on the sidewalk with the Irish mail — a design he recalls from his childhood as a toy and that, perhaps, is named for its use by mail carriers in Ireland — he needs to keep his eye out for those who are on foot.
“I go out of my way to be courteous to pedestrians,” he explained. “I say ‘excuse me,’ which is no problem with an oncoming pedestrian, but with people walking away, I’ve found that, frequently, if somebody has earphones or earplugs in their ears as I am approaching them, I will bellow, ‘Excuse me. On your left!’ — and I do not have a delicate, soft voice — they don’t hear me.”
This is particular situation is one he can resolve safely on his own. “I just slow down to a crawl, and I wait to ease around them so I don’t scare the daylights out of them,” he said.
But lately, Fitzgerald has been noticing bicyclists wearing earphones while they ride on the street — and that’s more troubling.
“Having a good set of ears protects you,” he said. “You want to know what’s going on behind you, how big it is, what kind of vehicle it is, how close it is, how fast it is going.”
When he hears a vehicle closing in, he says, he’s extra-careful not to drift to the left and may take a line of travel farther to the right, if possible.
Fitzgerald’s experience underlines a piece of safety advice that also is offered by government transportation agencies and cycling organizations.
“A bicyclist’s sense of hearing is their second most important sense, after sight,” noted Jennifer Ceponis, a transportation planner who works with the Capital District Transportation Committee‘s bicycling safety campaign, Capital Coexist. “Listening to your surroundings can alert you to an approaching vehicle, charging dog or other road hazard or obstacle.”
This is one cycling safety tip that may get overshadowed by appeals to wear a helmet while biking — which, I hasten to add, also is a very good idea.
In fact, while wearing a bicycle helmet is only legally required for children in New York, keeping at least one ear free of sound from an earphone is required by law for everyone, including motorists and cyclists of all ages.
Here’s the exact text of Vehicle & Traffic Law Section 375, Paragraph 24-a, which predates our recent flurry of anti-distracted driving laws focused mainly on cell phones and texting:
“It shall be unlawful to operate upon any public highway in this state a motor vehicle, limited use automobile, limited use motorcycle or bicycle while the operator is wearing more than one earphone attached to a radio, tape player or other audio device.”
Research conducted for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found in 2009 that quiet hybrid electric cars are more likely than models with internal combustion engines to crash with pedestrians and bicyclists, especially at low speeds when hybrids are more likely to be running only on electricity.
Clearly, walkers and cyclists do make adjustments or take evasive action when they hear motor vehicle traffic around them approaching — and that’s particularly important as more streets are designed to encourage all varieties of folks in motion to “share the road.”
While its rare, Fitzgerald’s Irish mail even makes its way onto the streets occasionally where traffic is quiet or to cross.
The traffic lanes on New Scotland Avenue are marked with so-called “sharrows,” double chevrons pointing in the direction of travel for both cars and bicycles on the street.
They are intended to show where cyclists should be able to ride without being hit by a suddenly opened car door, but cyclists don’t need sharrows to legally share a traffic lane.
We’re all out there together, now, traveling by car, on foot, by bicycle, and, occasionally, by Irish mail.

This 64 furthermore webpages of prepared material by Anne Smith was attained by me from General Service Archives in New York by authorization of your Trustees Archives Committee, on the advice of the.A. GSO Archivist Frank Mauser, Nell Wing, and Sue Smith Home windows, daughter of Dr. Bob and Anne Smith. Some sections are tricky to browse. Some were being typed up
by Sue Windows for her mother. Some had been duplicate pages. Plus some have very long been lacking.
Anne started recording her teachings in her journal in 1933 and ongoing until 1939 when Wilson’s Big Guide was posted. Anne was an ardent Bible student. She had been a school
attended Oxford Group conferences in Akron right until the founding of the.A. Group Primary in 1935. At the moment, Anne commenced Keeping Peaceful Time meetings early each morning in the Smith House. Alcoholics as well as their family members attended these meetings. Anne opened them with prayer, then go through the Bible, then led group prayer and looking for God’s assistance, and after that conducted topical dialogue from her journal, and about the Bible, and on topics in devotionals much like the Upper Room. You can find a lot of substance in Anne’s Journal that carefully resembles the contents of Bill Wilson’s Twelve Ways of 1939 that it's both of those doable and sure that Anne shared the journal teachings with Invoice and Bob in the Smith Dwelling over the summer time of 1935.

Sharing for launch (confession).” (7) “There is nothing inside our lives that we're not ready to share. It's the standard
of willingness.” (eight) “Share exclusively, uncomfortably so.” (9) “Pray prior to deciding to share, quietly.” (10) “Share your lifetime completely with just one individual at any given time, in order that there's nothing that you've not shared with someone at a while.” (11) “Hazards of sharing: “Can it be unpleasant? Can it be unsafe to me, or my reputation, or to Christ? The earth is full of witness concerning the hazards of not sharing. . . .

Sharing burns out the delight of self.” (14) “James—Confess your faults just one to another five:sixteen & pray one for another that ye could be healed.” (15) “I need to share to be truthful with God, myself & Many others.”
Step Six: (one) “Conviction. . . . Stay with him until eventually he makes a choice and claims it out loud.” (two) “A lot of people go into tirades about sin from the countrywide lifestyle, but refuse to manage it in their own individual life.” (3) “Lives depend upon our openness to try and do.” (four) “Obedience is among the crucial-words and phrases with the Christian lifetime. Refusal to obey blocks the channel, and stops even further term from God.” (five) “Boundaries to an entire surrender. “Is there something I gained’t stop trying? Is there any apology I gained’t make?” (six) “Be prepared to talk to God exactly where I am failing and to confess sin.” (seven) “Watch out for denials, protests, self-justification, evasions, undue feelings.” (8) “The following stage will be the Cross. Get them towards the place where they appropriate it. Get them to resist the matter that is definitely their cross in everyday life. Pray aloud with them. . . . It's not necessarily ample to surrender sin, but we must also assert the victory of your resurrection everyday living. It can be God that does it. Nothing at all you can do is of any use.” (nine) “Have you ever a Christ which will rid you of your respective sins and ship you in your way rejoicing.?” (ten) “What exactly is it that gives you the ability to come up with a ideal analysis? The truth that you've got had a deep conviction on your own. . . If This can be to happen, men have to acquire absolutely free minds, and also to smash old modes of assumed and details of view that have been built up with a rigid interpretation of the Bible. The Holy Spirit is able to dictate an excellent strategy.” (eleven) “A small sense of sin suggests a small feeling of Christ. The closer you can get to Christ, the greater sensitive you develop into to sin. The whiter the cloth, the greater effortlessly it is actually stained.” (12) “Is there anything in us which block’s God’s operate. . . . Marginal areas of self-control should be so crystal clear which you don’t occur inside a mile of temptation.” (thirteen) “It is mainly because We've overlooked sin inside our presentation in the Gospel which the message with the Gospel has lost it sting and blasting electric power. Our first want can be an emetic, not a narcotic.” (14) “Comprehensive surrender provides us to the point where by essentially the most trivial of incidents will witness to your love of God. You'll be able to’t surrender sin for those who won’t confess it. . . . The difficulty is to run away or surrender. Surrender to Christ or criticize the team. The welling up of criticism is the externalization of a lot more sin.”
Action Seven: (1) “Conversion. This is actually the turning to God, the choice, the surrender. (two) A maximum expertise of Jesus Christ brings about a radical improve in individual daily life, bringing a few selfless marriage to people about 1, which can be a problem to People we are available connection with.” (three) “God is willing to consider my past spiritual working experience and weld it into a new spiritual expertise.” (four) “God has spoken. The instant I listen to and obey His voice and are available to the place of total surrender on each and every spot of my lifetime, is The instant of rebirth, reunion with Christ plus a start out on an incredible revival marketing campaign. Rebirth, reunion, revival involves choice, self-discipline and dare. Surrender entails the explosive encounter of a Holy Ghost conversion, the expulsive power of a new passion.” (five) “Christ only can take out them and switch which has a new Standard of living. Browse Romans 12.” (6) “Face the reality. Never fake you could go on lifting on your own by your own private boot straps. In all humility to God, “What would thou have me to try and do? I'm Mistaken Father. You recognize a lot better than I, you've got a mala matura lot more wisdom, clearly show me how.’
Phase Eight and 9: (one) “Any restitution I won’t make?” (two) “Resentments to generally be confronted and set correct.” (three) “Restitution being created.” (4) “Help them make an index of factors.” (5) “Restitution. Within the matter of restitution, Global retraction must be made by a favourable, community statement equivalent in scope to the quantity of harm finished.” (six) “God can make me keen while in the day of His electric power.” (seven) “This includes and enterprises discipleship under the steering in the Holy Spirit, running up our shades, and assisting Many others to operate up theirs.”
Massive news!! Lo Five finally joins the Upitup family! All hail one of the best electronic producer in the Liverpool scene, also very active on the local scene with his own Emotion Wave imprint which serves as a label and some quality music events (like "A Day In The Sun" that’s happening on 25th of August in Birkenhead with a stellar lineup including Reedale Rise, S>>D, Isocore, Upitup Djs, Breakwave and many more!).
“My House Is My House - Volume 2” its the second episode of the “Dance Music You Can Fall Asleep To” saga, which shows a different side of Lo Five’s sonic powers: 8 tongue in cheek studies on the theme of Lo-fi House, Broken Car Stereos, Take A Break Magazine and 4 track recorders. I’ve tried and i delightfully fell asleep to these, but also listened to these sober and crashed into a lamp post.
More news: If you can speak italian you can check the reviews of our latest release “GeneratA” by Acchiappashpirt, on Vice's Noisey and The New Noise, the album is available to download here.
Also you can check all our lovely faces on these great pics by Andrew Bates of Upitup XV Birthday rave!
We’ve got more releases in the pipeline by Sert ONE, Germanager and a special project which will be out very soon signed Canary Warp (which will be a physical release, so save some dollahs, still free tho!)
Not very active online.. but very active IRL. Our 15th year started with a bang with our set at Bangface Weekender and our huge XV Birthday Weekender in Liverpool (pictures out very soon!) and now we have lined up an incredible series of new albums from new signings, is goin to be a good summer!
We start with Rome based art duo Acchiappashpirt formed by Albanian poet Jonida Prifti and sound artist SDT, a pillar of the Roman noise scene. And they are here with their first “trap sound poetry experiment”. The duo, inspired by the work of photographer Julius Eb, create a catchy combination of noise sculptures and evocative auto-tuned spokenword poetry (in albanian and italian). GeneratA is a full lenght ode to the post-reconstruction “New Generations” of the whole world, with deep industrial vibes and nods to dance culture.
After a year of gestation (and procrastination), the infamous KNOBHEADS compilation is out now on Upitup Records!
A pure labour of love, for the city and the scene, we've managed to bring together some of our favourite artists from our 10 years in Liverpool.
Featuring tracks from artists familiar to fans of Upitup alongside some fresh faces, including Upitup debuts for ASOK, Reedale Rise, Joe McLaughlin and Bantam Lions. Representing some of Liverpool's best crews - including Postmusic, Cartier 4 Everyone, Deep Hedonia, Emotion Wave, M62 and Less Effect - the compilation presents a cross section of the electronic music scene in Liverpool. From ambient to footwork, and techno to chillout donk, we've got you covered.
The slogan "Up It Up!" can be comprehended as a battlecry of digital culture. Unless you "up something up to the network", it stays where it is, unshared (in your brain, on your pc etc.). To "up it up" equally means to "go for it", to "make it hot".
Based in Rome, Stuttgart, and Liverpool, we initially just wanted to make our sounds accessible to the public. The idea was to create an open platform for sharing ideas and staying/getting in contact with people. We later realized we're running what's considered a netlabel.
Upitup remains completely uninfected by commercial interests - to the contrary, we love to see the music industry trying to catch up with new technologies while suffering from their self-imposed politics. We are proud to be able to supply our music for free.
With artists all around our polluted globe, from Down Under to Uptown USA, we will turn any party into a raving disco fuss. Feel free to contact us about anything:

When he was asked to describe his motivation for using samples, cutting them up and glueing them together to create a plunderphonic wacky-world, Vernon compared it to "the feeling when you step into a garage, jam-packed with all types of junk, getting squeezed by the dazzling impressions that make you -as David Lynch puts it- dream; it means making an emotional experience, giving yourself up to a certain sentiment..."
And boy does he have fun incorporating all those junk elements into his music! When performing his trailerpark polka live, Vernon seems to become one with his sound, an element himself, wearing a wife-beater and gesturing like a gipsy fotuneteller's raven.
The Berlin-based philosophy student regularly airs his show "Bekteshi's Grillstube" on Hyperground Radio, and recently just did a special for Phuj Phactory which was played by Ergo Phizmiz on New York's WFMU Radio.
Is Vernon's music an artform? I don't know, I'm not an artform critic. But I can surely tell you it's a crime!
Upitup has been giving away free music since 2003, and in order to be able to continue to do so we are asking you to make a donation. If you enjoy our music this is your chance to give us something in return. Buy one of our selfmade icons below (ranging from € 4.00 to €xpensive!) and it will be placed on the city you live in on our map. When somebody clicks your icon it will show a link to your website.

This image isn't finished yet, but it emerged so quickly that I wanted to share it in this stage, I started drawing it in the train to work today, and have worked half an hour on it tonight.
I saw it during the meditation I did for Isilringare, some weeks ago. This is the text from the notes that I took afterwards:
(...) and then she walked me back through her halls. Then I had some really beautiful and detailed views of parts of her halls .. it was quite amazing actually. There was a stair, winding down in a long arc outside of the building, the rock was sort of black and shiny, and there were white shrubs - leafless now - growing on it, like ornaments almost. At one vantage point we had a great view of Ithil - the moon - and the slope of that hill was adorned with many of a sort of white feathery plants, that all seemed to reach out to the Moon to greet her. "here you can go back easily" she told me, and so it was.
Wow, you made this on a train? I am impressed! Of course this is coming from someone who cannot draw so well hehe! I do better with a crochet hook Thanks for sharing, this is a great rendition!!
well, maybe I should explain that I didn't put up an easel in the train and used oil or acrylic paint on a canvas for this one
It's made in a paint program called Artrage. I use that quite a lot, it's good and very handy because you can work with (partly transparent) layers, which is of course impossible in traditional painting. It works very well together with a graphic tablet; it's almost like using real paint.
This is a lovely drawing, Melleth. There are some key similarities here between you rendering of Nienna's hall and what I've seen on my journeys to it. I have not much regarded upper levels, but do see them from the surrounding courtyard. The fence you've drawn comes through to me as a row of arched 'windows' on the lowest level of the hall. I do hope to make more drawings or paintings before too long; it's been awhile.
Here's the third version: I think I stop working on it now, because it feels finished enough. I could go on a long time detailing those plants ever more but that probably would not contribute a great deal.
Your drawing is beautiful. The plants somehow make me think of memories of trees, if that makes sense.
I, too, just love how this has developed, with more detail! It is a beautiful vision of Nienna's halls, really!
I just wanted to mention that to both Dineen and I, when we saw your first picture, the tree-objects reminded us strongly of hoarfrost.

2. Little league contact person is unknown regarding where to send their check. Suggestions were to contact Erna and Kevin Keller or Jim Mitchell of Troy who is the director.

8. The treasurer will be attending an end of year training in Bangor and will then meet with the auditors.
2. Gordon Fuller of the DEP has contacted Jay regarding the Skidgell property. A copy of a letter written to Steve Packard, attorney for Skidgells,to Gordon Fuller is attached. This letter relates some of the findings the DEP found with a limited investigation of the property inside and outside of the building which was done on December 12, 2006.
i. Phase 1 and 11 Environmental Assessment be performed by an environmental consultant. This would be helpful to the owners and any potential buyers as well as the MEDEP.
ii. If the Town is interested in the property they could explore requesting that the State Brownfields Program consider doing the Assessment. Jean Firth heads up this department, but the Town has to show an interest. This necessitates a letter from the Selectpersons to Jay which would be forwarded to the DEP and would need to be done before the next DEP visit.
iv. It is essential that the Town not procrastinate on the protection of the salt-sand pile with silt fencing and hay since according to Clint Spaulding hot ash spray will be difficult to obtain. David Bridges offered 100 feet of silt fencing he has.
B. Anderson trailer on Stevens Rd: Stakes have been put in by a site engineer relating to a septic system. Dave Schofield has been involved in this. Deeds are needed related to this property and others in the surrounding area. Set backs need to be met. If the Town has none then the State statute would have to be followed.
C. Cy Reynolds has been upset by the possibility of a septic system being installed and has said that he would get a lawyer and his wife voiced that DEP would be contacted. There is a contentious relationship between the plumbing inspector and the Reynolds.
1. Stevens RD property: The deed of property of Irene Anderson and her mother are needed before it can be put out to bid. A copy of these should be in the office.
3. Junkyards and Automobile graveyards: Discussion as to whether to adopt the State Statute or create our own ordinance. It was felt that the State Statute was too vague. According to Lynn Hadyniak, the Town could make it more restrictive, not less. This was questioned.
4. Jane Fasculo Property Offer: If the offer were accepted, the Town would lose taxable property unless some plans were made for some kind of income producing product. The conservation plan by Lissa Widdoff has not been received. There are 78 acres in this property divided into three lots.

B. Possible way to change this increase is to appeal it and show a decrease in the price of property. Steve Bennett discussed this with Mike Rogers and we had no ability to make a good appeal.
D. Valuations are based on property transfer information that Jeff Kendall receives. This information is then put into a ratio formula and the percentage of the assessment gives the municipal value.
8. TIFS: State has negative feelings regarding them. They decrease the valuation of the Town. Only Unity is know to have TIFS in the surrounding area.
10. Legislative staff of Micheau, Collins and Snow letter advising that through the US Department of Agriculture that there may be a grant available for the performing arts center at the new high school.
12. Irene Raven: Wants to move in to the trailer on Stevens Road. There currently is a mal-functioning septic system and she would also need a leach field. The area has been seen by David Schofield and a permit would depend upon where the property lines were. The area would really need to be surveyed. It would be up to the applicant to have the lines surveyed.
13. Special Town Meeting is scheduled for December 20th at the town office. A motion was made by Tim Biggs to have a special town meeting at 6:00PM on the 20th of December to vote on additional funds of not more than $3,000 to pay the Town Clerk. Motion was seconded by Steve Bennett and carried.

Accounts payable: $100,658.80; $95,752. includes payments to SAD 3 for October, November, and December.
1. Gerry Spaulding was present to discuss his tax bill and had many questions as to how the amount was arrived at, including how a house was classified. He was informed by the Selectors that they were trying to go by the Assessors manual. There were two mathematical errors found in his bill and an abatement form was made out. This has not been signed by Mr. Spaulding.
1. Seminars recently attended or will be attending sponsored by the Maine Building and Inspectors Association:
2. Phone call recently received from a CEO who had been contacted by an attorney regarding the Skidgells property and wanting an assessment done. A second CEO had been contacted. In the past the Skidgells had declined to allow anyone to enter the building. DEP has been notified of

10. 12/6/06 Letter sent to Skidgells regarding Phase 2 of the clean-up to be done. DEP is involved in this. The site was visited and much work had been done. There is wood there the owners would like to burn. However, there is a lot of hazardous material and Val Whittier of the DEP will contact the DEP person dealing with hazardous material.
11. Jay would like to contact the Town Attorney, in the future, to protect the Town, if it is agreeable with the Selectors. This letter would be to reiterate and document what has been done. Since Jay has been denied entrance to the building he will wait and see what happens with the DEP. He has noted salt on the Skidgells property.
1. Application for a snowplow driver has been received. This needs to be discussed with Clint Spaulding. Steve Bennett would be agreeable to this.
2. In the discussion that followed it was felt that they should have been considered as part of her regular work hours and there is no line item for training. She had been informed on two occasions that she was close to the allotted hours for pay.
3. In order to pay her above the budgeted hours there will need to be a special town meeting. If she were to be paid now, it would be an unauthorized expenditure and it would be illegal to do this.

3. Discussion continued by various citizens with input on the section of Beaver Hill RD in question for nearly an hour. It was felt by the Selectors and some of the audience that this was a civil issue.
4. Sallyann Hadyniak who lives in the area in question will bring in the information that had been provided to her.
A. Tax map he brought in and noted errors on; has any corrections been done? Also who makes the changes on the tax maps? The assessors do this with the help of Tony Neves. There is a need for updating the tax maps. Some of this has been done according to the Selectors.

She also felt that the last appointment to the appeals board should be rescinded because of a conflict of interest.
4. Valuation letter from Maine Revenue Service: They will increase the valuation by about four million dollars bringing it up to $40,500,000. There is a 45 day appeal length of time. A letter will be drafted and sent to Jeff Kendall to learn how they arrived at this amount.

The Town will then submit the bills for re-imbursement. This party must also provide evidence that 2 jobs per week have been applied for and check into other sources of help.
1. Mitchell Rd property: Asking price was too high. It was felt that he might be willing to agree to a lower price. Will bring up to the Budget Committee meeting.
2. Website: Still having problems. Sallyann and Marion have been unable to find minutes of the Selectpersons meetings. Also e-mailed minutes have been returned using the puppets@acadia.net site.
1. A group of concerned citizens questioned their denial of traveling on a part of Beaver Ridge RD. They presented minutes of a vote taken at an annual Town meeting in 1955 to discontinue a section of the road for maintenance which referred to a the road from O.B. Wards in a direction leading over Beaver Hill. There is a trail leading off to the right which leads to Oak Lane, (previously called Under the Beaver). The road above OB Wards referred to in E of this document has not been historically abandoned. When a road has not been maintained at public expense for motor vehicles for a period of 30 to 35 years prior to 1965 it is effectively abandoned by public statute and by common law reverts back to the private owners. Tim Biggs was able to give these citizens copies of the law that pertain to their right to use this road.
2. Carrie Bennett announced her resignation from the Recreation Committee and the Planning Board because of recent attacks on her horse which resulted in the animals demise. Carrie has been an outspoken advocate against the wind turbines. Those in the audience who were unaware of this uncalled for violence were all disturbed.

3. A letter from David and Glen Bridges was presented to the Selectors regarding the co-mingling of two parcels of property. They are filing for abatement and will meet with the Assessors on Saturday.

A motion was made to go into executive session by Steve Bennett and seconded by Tim Biggs to discuss this offer of a sale. Upon return from the executive session the Selectors stated that they had had a good discussion regarding this property which consists of 6 acres with 1000 ft of frontage. Currently there is a trailer, shed, well and septic system in place.
Glen Bridges suggested that they inform landowners of possible fire station there. This comment lead to a heated discussion regarding information being available to abutters.
5. Maine Revenue Service and State Planning Office document that required signing by the Selectors. This was done by Tim Biggs and Lynn Hadyniak.
1. Attendance in Augusta on November 9, 2006 for local health officers; meeting was very informative. Going back to statutes from 1918 showed how important this position was. Currently the group is trying to update or remove antiquated statutes.
1. Skidgel property: Jay Guber letter related to his re-inspection of the warehouse site was presented. Phase 1 has been accomplished as requested. Phase 2 needs to commence in the Spring of 2007. Letter is attached.
2. Attorney for Town for Planning Board: A motion was made by Lynn Hadyniak to hire Bill Kelly and associates as a company on behalf of the Town to work with the planning board on the CES application. Motion was seconded by Tim Biggs and carried. Steve Bennett was absent.
3. Attorney Kelly charges $145/hr regardless of what he is doing related to the case. He can be at the Planning Board meeting on the 20th and or the 29th. He will mail a contract and his CV. He has had 16 years of experience.

1. Hilary Fleming spoke on behalf of TOPS, a non-profit group, who has to find another meeting place since they no longer can meet at the Freedom Congregational Church because of changes in the insurance the church now has.

The Planning Board had no right to grant a 24 month waiver as had been requested. This had been the opinion of Ed Bearar, the attorney, who represents the Bennetts. MMA agreed with this as well.

However Steve will be moving; the trailer is not moving which means that a new leach field will be needed. The amount of land is insufficient unless he were to acquire the land next to him which has a dilapidated Town barn on it. The barn could then be removed and a new leach field could be created.

This area encompasses the end of the pavement on Sibley RD to the gate on Ron Prices land. There has been a question as to whether this is a road that has been discontinued for maintenance.

Sandy Pond Dam presents the most concern regarding a breach because of possible increased pressure and it has one weak area. The DOT had fences erected in the past for safety reasons on the bridge. However they could catch debris if the dams failed. This could possibly take the bridge out.
Lynn Hadyniak suggested that they contact the State regarding this fence and the potential problem with it.
We have not received official ownership of the dam, so who is responsible for taking care of it? Lynn Hadyniak will contact Tony Fletcher the hydraulic engineer at the State, DOT, Dale Rowley and Dana Murch of the DEP.

However, a mobile home such as this was can not be pro-rated. Pine View which owned the home needs to pay the rest of the due taxes.

1. Carol Richardson petition: Steve Bennett spoke with a legal representative from the MMA regarding this. There is a problem with Article 3. This Article requests an illegal and unenforceable action, because it is considered an ultra vires act (an action beyond town meetings authority). The Maine courts have held that it is impermissible for one legislative body to limit the ability of a future legislative body to act.
2. Further questions that were asked were related to a moratorium, and road abandonment and since the Selectman, Steve Bennett, calling MMA has a vested interest as a private citizen, in each of these issues no further answers were forthcoming, since this would be a conflict of interest and he will recuse himself in any thing related to the wind turbine project and not to vote on any petition to be put on the warrant so related.

6. Ron Price has done some research on a road leading to his hay field on Beaver Ridge. It is not passable with his farm equipment as it is. In the past he has spend money on this road. There is the possibility that it is a town road that is not maintained. Others feel it is a private road. Lynn Hadyniak stated that there are some roads that are a big issue. These should not be allowed to slide as their designation. This is an issue that is being worked on. Steve Bennett stated that he would be willing to help, as a private citizen, in making this a passable road.

8. Workers Comp Letter: Patty Stevens of the MMA had sent a letter since no one from Freedom had contacted Workers Comp regarding the Albion fire which we responded to for mutual aid. The Town is subject to a fine of $100.00 per firefighter because they had not heard from us.

Discussion surrounding this motion was that considerations and decisions having to do with any and all tax and assessment issues regarding the windmill
application was the territory of the Assessors, not the Planning Board. It was felt that handling that issue over to the Planning Board would be contrary to our roles in Town government as assessors and that the Planning Board would have enough on their hands with all the other issues related to this application.
5. A motion was made by Steve Bennett to have the above motion written into an e-mail and to be sent to all members of the Planning Board. This was seconded by Tim Biggs and motion carried.
6.

Discussion of this subject started with a request by the CEO, Jay Guber, for a Moratorium Ordinance. The two selectmen present agreed that the town is completely unprepared to meet the challenge that this windmill application represents, or for that matter, any of a number of other industrial or commercial applications.

Steve Bennett responded to this, by giving the history of Selectmen having a three-year term and the need for removal of a Selectmen if it became necessary.

The article is to solicit voluntary donations in an annual fund raising drive to help support the Freedom Volunteer Fire Department. The Board of Selectmen approved and accepted the draft article. Lynn Hadyniak will format the language in the form of an article to be placed in the warrant.
1. The Selectmen have called for all standing committees in town to have their annual reports submitted as soon as possible. The Budget Committee is meeting regularly Thursday nights at 6:00 p.m. until the proposed 2006 budget is completed
2. Craig Costello was called in follow-up to the 2004 audit he is working on. He was not available and did not return the call.
3. Salt and Sand Survey Evaluation must be submitted by February 17, 2006. The Selectmen discussed issues related to the location of the salt and sand stockpile and the cost associated with building an approved storage shed should the town choose to stay at the current site. There needs to be further discussion with Sidney and Mildred Skidgell concerning the purchase of additional land at the current site and Davia Cluck a coordinator at the Department of Transportation, for the design and development of saitfsand sheds.
4. The town has been notified that the Unity Area Recycling Center (UARC) has applied for a grant to provide a building for the recycling of discarded TVs and computer monitors. Each town that participates in the UARC will be expected to share the expense at $23.00 per person. This will have to be supported by the majority of the participating towns. The Selectmen Will include this as a warrant item at the 2006 town meeting.
5. The Selectmen discussed the Waldo County Budget Report for 2006. Freedom has not yet received a bill for the county taxes it was noted by Tim Biggs, the town's representative to the County Budget Committee, that the proposed Waldo County budget is $6.6 million. The county can not exceed a 5.8% increase,
6. Waterville Area Humane Society has submitted its contract with The town to accept any stray animals the Freedom Animal Control Officer delivers to them. The contract price is $840.00 and is based on $1.26 per capita. The contract is to be signed and returned to the agency. However, the Selectmen must include this in the warrant in order to fund the contract. Therefore the contract will be held until the town meeting is held.
7. Every town received a new computer from the state for voter registration. Freedom's list of registered voters is loaded into the system and will be used to check voters off during each election as soon as the system is implemented state wide. The Selectmen have received a request for a laptop computer to augment the desktop system in order to have the laptop in a location convenient for a ballot clerk to check voters in during elections. Request was discussed and denied.
8. Lynn Hadyniak was requested to contact MMA to discuss the ' ramifications of changing the approval of building permits from the sole approval by the CEO to approval by the Freedom Planning Board. A second issue was discussed concerning the approval process of buildings whose cost is less then an established dollar limit, i.e.: any structure less then $10,000.
a. Touch Tone Communications was contacted regarding telephone rates for long distance and local long distance for the town telephones, including the two lines in the town office, and the lines for the fire department and garage. She reported that she accepted the promotional offer of $.425/minute with no monthly minimum. A one time monthly charge of $1.50 for more then one line.
b. Jim Waterman was contacted for an update on the activity of the Freedom Volunteer Fire Department. Jim reported that he was in the process of writing a grant for the department which is to be submitted by February 25, 2006. If it is accepted the grant will fund 50% of the project and the town must fund 50% of the project.
10. Tony Neves reported that he has completed his work on updating the Freedom tax maps and is returning the maps to the town. He has made corrections based on reading the deeds, contacting property owners and walking property lines. He noted that he identified approximately 140 errors that have been found in the past 6year's work that he reviewed. Corrections and changes were made and the maps which he presented to the Selectmen. Mr. Neves has recommended that the assessors not write the property owners names on the Mylar maps only include map and lot numbers. That can be done on the paper copies of the tax maps. He has recommended the names currently noted on the Mylar maps be erased using a very soft erasure. When this is done the maps will be given to Jay Guber to have two copies of the maps made. Sallyann Hadyniak volunteered to take the names off the maps. As soon as they are done, she will contact Jay Guber to pick them up so he can take them and have 2 copies made of each of the 11 pages.
a. Mr. Neves submitted a bill to the Board of Selectmen for the work on updating the tax maps and has volunteered to update the tax cards that are affected by the work he has completed pointing out that new cards may be needed for clarification. Mr. Bennett thanked Mr. Neves for all he has and is doing for the town. The work will allow the assessors to assess these properties in a fair and accurate manner. Mr. Neves volunteered to assist the Board of Selectmen with assessing some additional properties but is not interested in completing a full assessment of the town.
b. Mr. Bennett recommended that the town retain Mr. Neves services to research the history of discontinued roads in town.
11. Basil Bames requested the status of Irving Lane and whether it is a discontinued road. There was a lengthy discussion with Mr. Neves, Basil Bames and the Board regarding Mr. Bames property lines and assessment of his land that is encompassed by Irving Lane, Timberwood Lane and abutting the Spencer farm on Rt. 137. Mr. Batnes also asked how his property, had been assessed and if open farm lands and swamp land had been considered.
David Schofield reported that he has completed one application for a septic system grant for a system in the center of town. There was discussion of other properties that may need septic revisions in and around the center of town. However, upon inspection there was no immediate contamination noted therefore the property would not be eligible for a commercial grant. The towns' legal responsibilities were discussed.
1. Jay discussed concerns about the Shaw subdivisions on the North Palermo Road and the lack of any documentation that the property ever changes hands. This is a problem for the town that may need to be discussed with an attorney. The town should state their position.
2. David Pottle has been asked to attend the Seleetperson's and the Planning Board meetings on February 1, 2006.
3. On January 13"Jay has received a request from an attorney for any and all town ordinances related to land division and development. This appears to be related to the land on Beaver Ridge which currently has a windmill testing for wind power generation.
5. Mr. Guber handed in his expenses related to seminars he recently attended including the cost of the seminar, mileage and meals. He also requested permission to attend another seminar and to join the Mid-Coast Code Enforcement Officers Association with dues of $10.00.
Others present: Clint Spaulding with Clint Jr. and Christopher, Jay Guber, Basil Barnes and Marion Bowers.
Mr. Barnes is going to have one of his lots surveyed to compare to what the Town says the acreage is. He refers to this lot as the Smith lot, which runs from Timberland RD to Dave Spencers line. According to his deed there are 175 acres in this parcel. He will have the other parcels of acreage done as well in the future.
A lot of his property is open hay fields which could be listed as farmland. It was unknown by Mr. Barnes if this is the way it is listed. If it were farmland the tax rate would be lower on that acreage.
Another issue he had was with the Irving Lane RD which is a discontinued or abandoned road. There is a bridge he has to cross to get to his hayfields and it no longer is safe to cross with his hay equipment. He would like help with this or else some help on the other end of the road. Steve Bennett explained that the Town could not help him with this since it is illegal for the Town to do this according to state law. The Selectmen will have Tony Neves check out the acreage.
2004 Audit: The auditor and his assistant were here all day on January 5, 2005. The State is requiring that fixed assets, know as GASBY 34, with a valuation at the time of purchase or given as a gift in the amount of $2,000 or more be listed. Article included would be land, real estate, and equipment. The value and when such articles were acquired would need to be listed.
All of the Town land was given as a gift with a valuation at the time of the gift as less than $2000. The Town Garage was given as a gift.
Abatement/ Supplement work session: Saturday January 7th the Selectpersons met with Tony Neves. This was not a secret meeting.
Budget Committee workshop will be on January 12th at 6PM. It is open to the public. There is a preliminary budget that Hilary and Steve have worked on.
He has on disc ordinances related to building, rentals, and sub-divisions. This was done several years ago so that he could know what he was enforcing. He has offered to update this with research; put it on floppies and the hard-drive and do a print-out for the price of $275.00 A book of Freedoms ordinances would be created.
Steve Bennett felt that there were very few new ordinances and if the Town had the floppies we could do the rest ourselves. David Schofield will discuss this with his wife, who has helped him in this project.
A grant application has been applied for sub-surface drainage for Stanley MacDonald. Reimbursement is requested at 100%. It is unlikely this amount would be forthcoming. A 10% fee is generally required of the homeowner. We now have to wait for State approval before any action can take place.
Waldo County Budget Report for 2006: This budget is for $6.6million. They were allowed increases that would not go above 5.8%.
Solid Waste Program: The Town needs to get involved in one of these programs mainly because of the cost of disposing of TVs, monitors, etc.
Workers Compensatation: No claims have been submitted and in view of this, our bill has gone down to $2,270.00.
Sullivan Contract: A contract that had been done in 2001 will terminate 2006. Mr. Sullivan would like to have us sign up for another five years. He would like to have us pay a surcharge for fuel of $75.00 per week for a total of twelve weeks, $900.00 he would be willing to forgo this amount if we were to sign up with him. At the annual Town Meeting the amount he is requesting for the surcharge can be put on the Warrant. It was also pointed out that this contract needs to be put out to bid.
1. A revenue and expense report was available to peruse. A Homestead check has been received in the amount of $18,622.00+. This was higher than anticipated. This was done in 2005.
1. The amount in the sand pile is getting low. More than one-half of it is gone. We had bought 2000 yards and had a 1,000 that had been left from last year.
2. Obtain more sand: Clint will see what John Works in Jackson has. The Town would have to haul it. It would be wise to hire some trucks to do this. Clint will look into getting a 1,000 yards of sand.
3. Need for a new truck: Clint will look into this. The cost would be put on the Annual Warrant and paid for with a low-cost revolving loan.
2. His work load has increased and he would like to have a raise. He has yet to put in for his mileage, fees, and meals. He would like to make the same amount the plumbing inspector does.
3. The building code whereby you need a building permit should read, 100 square feet, not 200 square feet. An example of this error has led Lori Hess to built a place thinking that she did not need a building permit, since her building would be less than 200 square feet. This error needs to be corrected.
4. Problems related to the Ken Shaw sub-division: He has a protective covenant which has not been put in the hands of the buyers. There is a lot of wetland in this subdivision.
b. Jim and Sylvia Moody of North Palermo RD , lot #6, building permit and plumbing permit. Have encountered major problems because of the wetland. Some of the wetland was filled in for their septic system. Work stoppage order given by Jay.
Jay has spoken with Ken Shaw and instructed him that he was to send a certified letter to buyers of property which would include a map and th protective covenants related to this subdivision.
7. There is a need to have a policy whereby the Planning Board approves building permits. This would require all applicants for a building permit to go before the Planning Board for approval. This would include applications for new homes, mobile homes, shoreline zoning and commercial or new businesses.
Mutual Aid to Knox: The Freedom Fire Department responded to the dwelling fire in Knox. Our fire-truck slid off the road when it hit an icy patch but no damage was done to the truck or to personnel.
Steve Bennett checked the Selectmens manual regarding disbursements. There was only one page and nothing there mentioned keeping a disbursement book.
Letter from Maine Property and Casualty: Letter of explanation was requested related to issues with the Fire Department and the Town Garage. Steve Bennett will take care of this
2. Augusta Business Machine related to upkeep of the copier; $301.60 for renewal and it was felt to be well worth it. The present machine is cranky. It may be getting close to the time that a new one is needed. The contract for this upkeep was signed by the Selectmen.
3. Sullivan Brothers has a $300.00 surcharge. It was questioned as to whether this was in the contract if there is one. He will be informed that it will be put on the budget for 2006 to pay this bill for 2005.
Currently there is no clear title to the earthen dam. Dana Murch of the DEP has given his permission to remove several trees that present a potential problem. In lieu of an engineers study, these offending trees need to be cut down which could cause more damage.
When there is an adequate amount of ice, the trees need to be removed. Craig is willing to monitor the depth of the ice. When there is a dept of ten to twelve inches he would be able to get a group together to saw them and lower them slowly to the ice. He will notify the Selectmen when this is able to be done.
Committees be informed that budget requests and annual reports be made by February 1, 2006 and turned into the Town Office. This motion was made by Steve Bennett and seconded by Tim Biggs. Motion carried.

It is pretty common for most people to end up wasting money when they are starting a construction project. Frankly, most of us tend to hire service companies and professionals based on their service rates. If you are more worried about your expenses than the job quality, you will eventually have to spend more and more money trying to fix things down the road. Instead, you need to consider hiring the right people so that you will get the job done with a high efficiency level and also, your final result will be much better. Even though it seems pretty straightforward, you will have to put some effort when trying to find the ideal construction company with the right expertise. Instead of relying on scams and unreliable recommendations, you should invest time to find a professional on your own. This brief guide will definitely help you identify the right type of service providers based on a few factors and they will guide you in the right path.Professional reputation of construction workers should be your first concern. Even though you can find dozens of different construction companies quite easily, only a handful of those service providers will have a trustworthy reputation. Whether you are looking for a company with a bigger workforce or modern equipment such as a good boom pump, you should always consider their professional record before jumping to conclusions. Hiring a reputed worker or a company will always be a good step.Reputation plays an important role, of course, but it does not matter if you cannot afford the service, right? That is why you have to focus on your investment limits and expense plans before hiring a professional.
When you have filtered out suitable construction companies by their professional reputation, your next goal should be talking to them and getting comprehensive quotations about their service rates. Most of them will have the same price tags but that all depends on how good your investment is and how much you are willing to spend.Make sure to check their expertise before hiring a company. If you want your construction to be done with heavy duty steel bars and shotcrete Hunter Valley, you will have to identify companies and contractors with the right expertise or else, you will be disappointed with the end results.Completing a construction project is a real relief, of course, but if you can save more money down the road together with an efficient result, your project will be an ideal one. Plan everything ahead and hire a few consultants or engineers to help you out with planning as well.

Edgecam is a market leading computer aided manufacturing (CAM) system for NC part programming. With unparalleled ease of use and sophisticated toolpath generation, it's the only CAM system you'll need for milling, turning and mill-turn machining. Edgecam utilises your in house knowledge and experience to drive the CAM process with automation tools to suit different applications - allowing you to maintain your competitive edge.
Edgecam 2018 R1 introduces 'Detect Undercut Stock' which enhances the already powerful stock detection command by analyzing previously undetected areas of stock. This option helps to avoid 'fresh-air' cutting and thus reduces machining time. In certain case cycle time can be reduced by as much as 50%.
Automatic collision detection has been added to the Rough Turning Cycle. Prior to this enhancement, a user would manually apply profile extensions to avoid collisions. As the user no longer has to intervene, time will be saved in initially creating the CAM instructions. Moreover, strategy manager authors may now use this new function produce safer toolpaths.
A major enhancement is the removal of unnecessary CAM regeneration. Specifically, when a user makes an edit to an existing command, Edgecam will not automatically regenerate the remainder of the instructions. When editing a tool command, users will notice that there is zero regeneration if the alteration doesn't affect the corresponding cycles e.g. coolant, high-speed condition
Profiling cycle offers new 'Spring Cuts' command where the user can add extra cuts if required to improve accuracy. This is particularly useful on materials where elasticity is an issue.
Cycle time calculation has been improved through the new 'Adjust Feedrate on Arcs' command. The function will lead to both correct code and a more accurate cycle time calculation.
Edgecam 2018 R1 reacts to the growing popularity of a new, lightweight 3D model format by introducing support for JT Open file. Datum identification has become easier by way of different display markers. Users can now comprehensively edit a manually created milling feature. Formerly when extra edges were required, the feature had to be re-created.
Edgecam 2018 R1 provides support for 'Deep Hole Drilling' - also known as 'Gun Drilling'. When activated the new 'Deep Hole' strategy will empower the user to control entry, exit and intermediate drilling conditions.
This technique is particularly important where specialised 'Gun Drilling' tools are used and the process requires accurate and precise code output.
The Chinese New Year started January 28, 2017, the Mints of the World have released innumerable versions of the popular Lunar Year gold and silver coins.
In Chinese astrology the Zodiac is rotating in 12 years’ cycles. This year is The Year of the Rooster. The Zodiac animals are always bringing with them the elements of metal, water, wood, fire and earth. Each year, however, the animal is assigned a certain element. This means that the elements are rotating in 60 years’ cycles.
Astrologers claim that both the sign and the element of your birth year affect your personality and most important of all….. your Destiny. The Year of the Fire Rooster. Loyalty, commitment, hard work, family values, and cool appearances are characteristics that will be rewarded. People born in 1957 are also Fire Roosters.
Astrology tells us that the lucky numbers are 5, 7 and 8. Something you should take into consideration if you are superstitious and investing in gold and silver.

Last year on this date I put out a few ideas on Switching from Warhammer 8th edition to Kings of War 2nd edition. I wanted to take a look at it, and share just a little with you, my readers.
Why? Because that single post generates (and that is current tense, not past) 11% of the traffic to my meager little blog by itself. To share some numbers, when I looked this morning, I have managed to get 89,175 page views for my blog since I started it on February 15th, 2015. Of those, that single post is responsible for 9,820 of them. The next biggest was last month, and has about 1/4 of that (2,526 (the initial pre-release pictures of the new Empire of Dust)).
I find that when I can get new pictures out (especially before Mantic releases them) than I get a lot of views because people - well gamers - are always wanting the next new thing.
I decided to just take a look at my old post - and of course the very first thing I see is a typo on the second line that has been there for a year (a missing closing ')'). (I like to use parenthesis because I often have side thoughts (and side thoughts to my side thoughts) that I set aside with them). (My son often points out typos to me after I put up a new post - which often means I'm scrambling to correct them from my phone because I'm not near my computer (yes, these are written ahead of time (or on my lunch hour) and scheduled))
This post has almost no pictures. A quick graphic I made up and a shot of one of my dwarf units. So it wasn't shiny new pictures.
I did put in some tables to help people translate from one game to the other. Looking at one of those I see that some of the names of the new armies have changed, and of course Uncharted Empires came out in November, so those new armies are not longer in an upcoming supplement. Time to update.
One thing I've noticed is that I have to share any of my posts heavily on facebook (I try to only do it to relevant groups - so I don't share posts on Deadzone to Kings of War groups, and the (ok rare) non-Mantic post does not go to Mantic groups) for people to actually read my new posts. I'm satisfied when a single posts gets more than 100 views, and happy when it hits over 200. Without sharing, a post gets less than 40. (So I honestly don't expect many people to read this one, because it isn't one that I'll be spamming around facebook (that will be tonight's regularly scheduled post) :-) ).
"So what?" you think? Well the W->KoW post is still getting hundreds of views every week, and is quite often still the most viewed page on my site for any given period of time. New pictures may beat it for a little while, then it climbs back on top. And beyond when I initially posted it, I have not been promoting it.
I have linked to it a few times - people would specifically ask how to convert so I'd give them the link. I've also seen other people link to it (that always gives me a little warm feeling in my heart). Word of mouth and people sharing it are what keeps it going.
The environment has changed. AoS, The 9th Age have both come out to fill the void, alongside of Kings of War, that Warhammer Fantasy Battles left behind last summer when Games Workshop blew up the old world and discontinued the game. They have also since discontinued their entire Tomb Kings line - and Mantic is releasing the Empire of Dust for all those who wanted a dry, dusty undead force. The wounds that many players feel from the death of WFB are not healed, but they aren't fresh either. Most players have now moved on - either from the hobby entirely, away from large scale fantasy gaming, or to one of the alternatives. It surprises me that there are still so many people who are looking to convert a year later.
I have found that I tend to be on the outside with many of my opinions. I used to ask the question "Is it just me or do others think <some thought>". Well I stopped doing that because the answer was always, inevitably, yes, it was just me. When I find a blog post about Kings of War that I find interesting, I add that blog to my RSS feed so I'll see any new posts they put up. With the low readership without me spamming new posts to facebook - yeah that is just me.
Anyway, I didn't do anything when I hit my first anniversary. (yes, I have added and backdated a lot of old posts from other sources - with the idea being that eventually all the stuff I have written about Kings of War will be in one place. It is a slow, tedious and boring process, and no one else seems to actually care (a lot of which I can count the number of views on one hand)). But reflection is good at times.
It is hard to say why I write this. Yes, the fame and glory are all well and good (in my head at least). It isn't for the money. Let's just say that I won't be quitting my day job anytime soon (so far I've accumulated a whopping $22.82 in add revenue from the blog (realizing that Google won't cut a check for less than $100 - so maybe in a couple more years I might actually get a check). Part of me just wants some sort of outlet for my thoughts, and to share. I figure with my kids all moved out of the house I need to generate another source of stress (What am I going to write about now - and going to posting twice a week (at least) makes that even worse).
So I can't say why one post is so popular. As a whole this seems to be growing, if slowly. A few people seem to enjoy my ramblings on games, so I don't plan on stopping.
With the release of the rules and starter lists for Kings of War 2nd Edition (if you don’t have these – you can download them at Mantic web site), as well as the release of Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, many people are looking to try Kings of War with their existing Warhammer armies.
This post will attempt to describe the differences between the games. The list may seem large, but in practicality it is quite an easy switch from Warhammer 8th edition to Kings of War 2nd edition. Plus there is nothing stopping you from playing both games, or using your miniatures to play any games you want. I will be posting more a tutorial on how to play Kings of War later, this however is just the differences.
First Kings of War is NOT Warhammer Light. It is not based on Warhammer. It was written by Alessio Calvatore, who wrote Warhammer 7th edition and many Warhammer army books. But Alessio also writes historical war games, and the idea of ranked of units has been around since H G Wells published “L…
At Gencon, I asked Ronnie Renton himself when the Historical supplement for Kings of War was coming out and he said next month.
This may not be the final cover, but for everyone that wants to field their Mongol Hordes or Spartans, the book will be out next month
With Kings of War Historical players can now enjoy their love of both Fantasy and Historical massed battle games! This supplement will allow for numerous armies from past ages to be played on the table top. From Samurai, Vikings and the armies of the Crusades, you can recreate your most loved periods in history!
We've heard the rumors, we've seen the open day pictures and renders. We've been told that the studio models are being painted and we should have pictures of them soon.
But since when have we ever been content with waiting. Mighty Ape, an online retailer in Australia has pre-orders for the new Empire of Dust, which I believe is scheduled for release the end of July (remember that when Mantic gives a release date it is the date it BEGINS shipping, not when it hits retail stores)
I do want to also clarify that these are all pre-production images and lists - and they may be subject to change. The prices are my estimates - Mighty Ape has the australian prices - but those aren't in US $ and may be discounted (so I'm trying to guess at US MSRP). Also all of these come with bases for everything and mantic points, so I'm not listing those with each entry.
June sees some big releases from Mantic for Kings of War. When I say big, I mean BIG. Monstrous even.
First, in June the forces of the abyss are finally getting a model for the living legend Chroneas. Now a Chroneas is a monster, and while not unique, they are rare enough to never encounter more than one. Of course with Fireball 20, Piercing (1) and the special rule that it is NEVER disordered (i.e. the only way to stop it shooting at you is to kill it) they do seem to show up in almost everyone's list.
To help balance this out, the good armies see the release of the final dragon variant funded by the Kings of War 2nd Edition Kickstarter - the Basilean High Paladin.
The neutral players need a bit of loving as well - so the Forces of Nature (ok, the Brotherhood can take one as well) get the next Greater Elemental - water. (This leaves only the air elementa…
The new nameless faction is coming for Deadzone. You can currently pick up the faction starter and three of the leaders from your FLGS or the Mantic webstore.
So what do you get for the Nameless Deadzone faction starter? There are 12 plastic pre-assembled minis (these are the same as you get in the minion booster, and are also the same ones that are in the upcoming "Terror in the Deep" Star Saga expansion. However the deadzone starter also included six additional resin models.
So to start off are the scuttlers. Some of the weakest of the troops - these little crabs are your cheap options to fill out your troops.
September Releases Set for release in September (remember Mantic usually does their releases on the last Monday of the month).
Kings of War Of course I'm going to start with Kings of War (if you wonder why - seriously, have you been reading much of this at all?)
No one is interested in this new Hardback rule supplement with 30 army lists ranging from ancient to around the 1500's (I think war of the roses is the most recent). Ok, seriously folks. Pre-order this NOW. I put up a little post a couple of weeks ago that wasn't much more than this picture and saying it was coming out - well that is now the #2 most view post in my blog with over 2500 views (my average is a few hundred).
If you want to see all the details about this what is coming in this expansion - just watch this space.
If you are like most gamers, you will someday find that you are out of room. Whether it is for the newest miniatures or board game, often physical space can get to be an issue. Even if you dedicate an entire room (or half your basement) to gaming, the number of games you have will ALWAYS increase to fill all available space.
Gamelyn Games was built to fill that very niche - with their Tiny Epic games. (OK, they have done one 'normal' size game). The Tiny Epic games are small boxes that easily can fit into your game shelf. But the games inside are anything but.
The latest in their lineup is Tiny Epic Zombies. I just received my kickstarter copy, and it is scheduled for general release in October, just in time for Halloween. Now there are a LOT of zombie themed games out there - but some of them are so overflowing with miniatures, boards and cards that you need a push cart just to carry everything (Zombicide being a great example, with more miniatures and expansions tha…
The fecal excrement is about to impact the rotational cooling device. And if you don't believe me, just look back at last year.
Yes, the new edition of the tournament 'recommendations' - Clash of Kings 2018 is coming. It has a release date set for January 22nd (Mantic seems to be moving to Monday releases instead of Fridays). This book promises to have the new narrative concluding this (or, by the time it comes out, last) years summer campaign, including the new map of Mantica, changed by the campaign. Of course this will be mostly ignored by most competitive players, as they will be turning immediately to see what changes have been made for the upcoming tournament season. New & changed units, spells and artefacts.
I can already hear the gnashing of teeth, the pulling of hair, and the clinching of sphincters as opinions explode across the internet. However since this was not able to be release in December as originally …
So it looks like another ManticOpen Day has come and gone. Not only am I an ocean away, but I headed in the opposite direction this weekend, visiting family in Oregon.

Some of the greatest temptations come not from the devil trying to make us bad but rather from our own attempts to get what we feel we should have.
Many times we are tempted with a sense of entitlement. This is the reason why most people feel justified in their sin. It’s an “I’m doing this because” or “I deserve it” or “It’s mine” kind of justification.
Sometimes the devil tries to make us fail and at other times he tries to make us succeed. However, he is powerless to do either without our help.
These truths are mirrored in the account of the temptations of Christ. “The devil took Jesus to an exceedingly high mountain, (Matthew 4:8), and showed Him all of the kingdoms of this world and their glory.”
9 And the tempter said to Jesus, "All these things I will give You if You will fall down and worship me."
10 Then Jesus said to him, "Away with you, Satan! For it is written, ’You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve.’"
I was 14 years old the first time I remember seeing a person do something wrong for what they said was the right reason. I was working hauling hay for a guy who was 19 years old and admittedly the wildest boy I knew. My mom didn’t like me being around him because he was so unpredictable. I’m going to call him Bill instead of using his real name because 15 years later he and I had both changed and I became his pastor and he often still watches me preach online. And, I have never shared this story with anyone, including him, but perhaps he will remember it, or maybe not. Nonetheless, it was a singular moment frozen in time for me … we all have them.
I always remember being a deep thinker. I hardly allow a moment to go by in my life which I am not analyzing to see what wisdom or understanding I can squeeze from it. I don’t always follow the wisdom I glean from these moments but I do catalogue it and am able to vividly replay it over and over in my mind. That summer day holds just such a memorable molten moment for me.
Bill, as I’ll call him, owned a 1955 Buick 2 door hardtop with a 322 cubic inch V-8 that turned out a whopping 236 horsepower. Buick boasted it to be the fastest model on the market, series for series. My dad had owned one just like it in 1959 and 1960 when we lived on Peyton Street, just off Homestead, right down the road from Houston Gardens Elementary in east Houston, where I went to 1st grade. That year I rode with my dad from Houston all the way to Plattsburg, NY in an emergency run to help his little sister who was about to deliver her 3rd child when her Air Force husband was killed in a car wreck. Man that car would run! I’ve got some other memories of that car I think about on occasion.
Well, Bill did have a wild nature and living with his sister he was void of any parental oversight as well. He was a strong and good looking boy, intelligent but quick tempered and a bit of a smart-aleck. We broke off hauling hay for lunch that day and hopped in the Buick for a fast ride to the only store in Corley, Texas - population - maybe 50. The whole store was only 20’ by 30’ and stacked high with food and supplies the owner thought the little country community might need. The coke box was on the back wall, hidden from view of the cash register and lunch meat counter.
When we walked in Bill told the owner that we wanted two thick bologna and cheese sandwiches with mayonnaise, and then we proceeded back to the coke box. Bill pulled out an RC Cola for himself, opened it quickly, looked to see if he was hidden from the owner’s view and drank it like he was pouring it down a hole. He then put the bottle in the case of empties which always sat beside the coke box, got out two more, opened them and handed me one. He noticed the look on my face and said: I’m not going to pay for that first one because I was in here yesterday and he overcharged me for lunch. I’m just making up for it.
I can remember it like it was yesterday. All of the sudden I felt challenged to make a judgment. Was this right or was this wrong? I mean, if the man overcharged Bill why not simply even the odds by taking something from the store. My thoughts demanded attention and decision. I felt, like at other times before and since, that whatever I decided was going to last me a lifetime. That’s not the kind of decision I could make in 10 seconds while standing at a coke box waiting to get accused of stealing. I decided that I would have to chew on this one a while to come up with the right answer. Like I told you earlier, I am by nature a deep thinker. To give you a little insight into how much I like to think: my oldest grandson gave me a riddle to think on over a year ago and although I haven’t had the time to devote to figuring it out, I still won’t let him give me the answer – I want to save it to think about when I get some time … I like to think.
It’s wrong to do bad to accomplish good. The good you accomplish will always have a bad shadow over it. I decided that there just had to be a better way, even if it cost more or even if some things don’t ever get fixed.
Now you might think, “Everybody knows these things!”, but you would be mistaken. Many people live their lives justifying their behavior because they feel some sense of entitlement to do whatever they need to do in order to get whatever they feel they deserve. And it is sad to say that they often surround themselves with friends who agree with them and often, in their minds, they even imagine that God agrees with them.
The devil tempted Jesus to do just that; to get what He deserved the quick and easy way – a shortcut to success without all the paperwork – all of the kingdoms of the world and all their glory … it is what Jesus wanted and what He deserved and all Jesus had to do to get it was … just do a little wrong. Certainly God would understand …
Oh come on now – Jesus was out in the wilderness by Himself – who was going to know how He got what was rightfully His anyway. There was nobody there to tell on Him and really, who would care anyway. Wouldn’t He make a better king than all the other kings who were in place? What was the downside … it’s not like Jesus was going to continue worshipping or listening to satan – all He had to do was bow just this once and from here on out He could do whatever He wanted … and besides that – nails hurt and people don’t like Me anyway! Surely God understands – can’t you see - we both get what we want and nobody has to get hurt. I can’t imagine God being against the devil losing all of those kingdoms … what kind of God would want His Son to be crucified anyway if He didn’t have to be? Who would want to serve a God like that?
Well, this is the problem – it may not be the picture of “your god” but the picture of your god might not be an accurate portrait of the one and only, true and living, ever faithful “Almighty God”, Ruler of heaven and earth, Supreme Creator of the Universe. Only God can paint that picture.
Don’t work on your own or with others to create and fashion an image, even if it is a mental image, of a god who agrees with your notions, your morals or your standards of life. Rather, fashion yourself to agree with Him, Almighty God. Don’t paint your own picture of God and:
4 "You shall not fashion for yourself any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth;
5 you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me,
I would venture to imagine that your spouse would not want you to be carrying around a picture of another man or woman in your wallet, or even in your head, thinking they were better looking, more desirable or wishing you could be with them – neither will God put up with it. He is a jealous God!
Even though every one of us has sinned and God is yet willing to show each one His mercy. Today, if you will not harden your heart, allow the Holy Spirit to mercifully convict you of sin – repent – and commit to living a life pleasing to Him.
Production Note: (Once we go live I am going to ask someone to come to the platform to assist me. I will give them a flashlight and ask that the house lights be dimmed. My assistant will attempt to shine the flashlight in such a way that I can make some shadow hand puppets on one of the big screens. We will want to capture these images on camera for viewers and post production edit potential. After making a few, hopefully recognizable shadow puppets and getting the congregation to guess what they are – I will conclude by revealing what they already know but aren’t focused on. These are neither dogs, nor rabbits and turtles … rather they are all shadows of my hands. I will conclude and lights will come up and I will make brief application as we turn to our beginning text.)
16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:
At one time, a shadow set in stone was the only reality known to the children of God. However, just as a shadow is but a dim outline of a body, the law was but that same dim outline – a shadow of the truth – but now we have the body, Christ Jesus, with all the clarity and detail which no shadow could ever reveal. The law was but a shadowy resemblance of a solid substance upon which the light was shinning.
Why embrace an obscure representation or attempt to make a lasting relationship with but a dim outline of the truth when the truth itself has been revealed unto us. The law is the shadow of Christ, the shadow of truth, set in stone, without depth, without dimension and without life.
Hebrews 10: 1 For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with these same sacrifices, which they offer continually year by year, make those who approach perfect.
A shadow set in stone can no more save a man than can the blood of bulls and goats. It takes life to begat life and no stone has that power. The law was meant only to represent a truth which it could never reveal. A shadow cannot touch you, comfort you or have relationship with you. We know the difference between a solid substance and a mere outline set once and for all in stone. Christ is the truth revealed while the law was but a shadow of that truth during which time the truth was kept concealed.
Only when the light is come and we have seen the substance can we ever truly understand the shadow. And by the way … the shadow is not alive and the shadow knows nothing … it is but a shadow. The shadow does not determine nor design the body, rather the body defines the shadow.
Part One of this series asked and answered the question: Why? Why did God give us the law? As the Apostle Paul put it: What purpose does the law serve? (Galatians 3:19ff) Our studies Sunday revealed the law was a schoolmaster which was designed to bring us to faith. Once we come to faith, we are no longer under the law or its punishments, penalties and curses. However, this in no way encourages a person to become lawless.
When I was a child my mother taught me it was wrong to lie. When I lied she punished me. Today I am no longer under her law or subject to her punishment. However, it is still wrong to lie and lying can set me up to fail in life. She taught me right and it is now my responsibility to live right.
Let’s begin this evening’s study with a simple survey of the First Table of the Law as recorded in: Exodus 20
By the time the Children of Israel get to Mt Sinai in Exodus 20 it has been 45 days since they celebrated the first Passover and came out of Egyptian slavery, crossed the Red Sea and began their journey through the wilderness. God had provided manna in the mornings and meat in the evenings. The number of days are important here because they are a shadow of things to come. They will add up to 50 days between the killing of the Passover Lamb and the appearance of God in the fire on Mt Sinai.
The New Testament revelation of this Old Testament shadow confirms that Salvation came at Passover but the Power and Presence of God comes at Pentecost – 50 days after Passover, both in the OT and in the New!
The Ten Commandments were written on two tables of stone, written with the finger of God. (Exodus 31:18)
When Jesus was questioned by the young rich ruler, recorded in Matthew 19, Jesus first recounted those commandments which were listed on the Second Table of the Law – those Commandments which deal with how man should treat man. Even though the young rich ruler had kept those specific commandments, he still felt empty and unsatisfied with his life and relationship with God. It was then Jesus pointed the way to eternal life … the key to eternal life is contained on the first table of the law – let’s read:
It is vitally important in understanding the law that we understand God’s intent and how God is revealing Himself, His heart and His hope for the relationship He is offering to His Children. He begins:
When I was a much younger man, serving in the military, I was continually around very important and high profile world leaders. As a body guard for high ranking US and Foreign dignitaries and a personal driver and primary security for the Commander in Chief of All Allied Tactical Air Forces in Europe who was also the Vice Commander of NATO during the Cold War, I was continually surrounded by the most important figures and decision makers of the day.
Although I was a nobody, my boss was a somebody. Once while I was visiting with him in his office I saw a plaque on his desk, it read:
“In an official society where one man is officially superior to another, the superior, if he is a gentleman never thinks of it, and the subordinate, if he is a gentleman, never forgets it.”
In other words, you should never make your boss feel like he has to say, “I’m the boss!” It is a bad feeling to be forced to defend yourself or remind your followers that you are in charge. And yet, this is exactly what God is doing … why … evidently because He feels they need to be reminded.
It is important to remember who paid the price when they didn’t have to … at least, God thought it an important prelude to giving His commands.
Nobody else did this for you – it was Me! That should be enough to show you how I feel about you … when I could have chosen anybody … when others would have loved for Me to choose them … I chose you! (Deuteronomy 7:6-11; John 15:16; 1 Peter 2:9)
Now all God wants is for us to choose Him back! He is fully committed to the relationship, first and most, and He is asking for the same level of commitment from those whom He has rescued.
And, by the way, He has rescued you and me … all He still wants is for us to choose Him back! This is the shadow of a marriage to come – God is talking to the Body of Christ and every member in particular.
Every commandment, each set of instructions, all laws of God and any decision God makes is always aimed at the good and the future of His Children.
God knows that no other god will love you, care for you, devote themselves to you or treat you the way He will. He can’t stand the thought of you marrying or being devoted to something else you worship more than Him. He is a jealous God … but a God who love you and is wholly devoted to you. (Exodus 20:5; Deuteronomy 4:24; Exodus 34:14 – His Name is “El Qanna” – A Jealous God {not the God of jealousy, but a jealous God})
God is acutely aware that all other gods are false gods with empty promises who are only in the god business for their own benefit and who in the end will leave you out in the cold to fend for yourself.
One of the gods men choose to replace the Lord of Glory is money. There are others, but money is at the top of the list. In fact, God says that the love of money is the root of all evil. ( 1 Timothy 6:10) And, those who serve money will end up straying from the faith and pierce themselves through with many sorrows. Jesus further said:
"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.” (Matthew 6:24)
Don’t allow anything to become more important to you than God. God does not like anything that demands or receives His time, His attention or His affection from you. He loves you and He knows:
I will venture to say that many people, most of them Christians, are afraid of the Ten Commandments. They are concerned that God might really mean them. One reason why pastors don’t often teach on them is because many don’t understand them and how they apply to the Believer’s life. Yet, the Bible is very plain when it comes to explaining the continuing role of God’s law in our lives.
16 Now behold, one came and said to Him, "Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?"
17 So He said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."
18 He said to Him, "Which ones?" Jesus said, "’You shall not murder,’ ’You shall not commit adultery,’ ’You shall not steal,’ ’You shall not bear false witness,’
21 Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."
This morning it will become clear, once and for all, why God gave the law to His Children. Before we attempt to understand the law itself, we need to understand what God intended when He first decided to give it. Without this knowledge it may be impossible to embrace the New Testament revelation and the grace-filled application of the 10 Commandments. So today we will discover: Why?
It’s not hard to imagine that there was a time when people did not know what God expected of them. (Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 10:16) For generations their hearts had been darkened by sin and separation from God and they had no inner witness guiding them in the right ways, (Ephesians 4:18; 1 John 2:27), and - there was no Bible … no written record of God’s interaction with man. Left to themselves, people have no chance of finding, understanding, or pleasing God. (Proverb 29:15)
When we first meet the chosen people in the Bible, it speaks of them as children, God’s Children, (Psalms 82:6), – but children nonetheless and children who need a teacher to instruct them. (Galatians 4) It is no different with anyone’s children, including God’s. Children possess an innocent, although destructive, “self will”. The deficit of wisdom and the knowledge which exists in a child’s mind serves to make them dynamically unprepared to successfully manage life and its complexities. In addition, as children grow through adolescence and into adulthood, their life experiences don’t always serve to make things better – life, left as the only teacher, often results in people being wounded, disappointed and bitter.
Children cannot be left alone to guide, guard or grow themselves by themselves. Children are incapable of making the right decisions at the right time for the right reasons without being given guidelines. The dangers were just too many and the risks too great for God to abandon His Children to the elements of this world and leave them without instructions for life. For this reason, God gave His Children the law.
Once, when my children were children, there was a law in my house. In fact, in the summer of 1981 Brenda and I took a sheet of paper from a legal size yellow tablet and thereon we inscribed our law and posted it on the bedroom door as a reminder for our 2 year old son and 4 year old daughter. They could not even read but I hoped that someday they would. But even though they could not read, they could understand that we had clear expectations for their lives and that we intended to govern their behavior.
Now some might think it strange or overkill to write out a set of rules for young children to follow but I think it more strange to raise a family with no defined expectations and no clear instructions. The scriptures tell us that before the law there was no sin. (Romans 7:7ff) This simply means that where there are no expectations there can be no infractions. In other words: Instruction before correction. Children should be taught the unchanging rules of life.
And, lest someone think that 2 year olds are too young to learn the do’s and don’ts of life … rethink – By the time a child is two they learn to recognize people, eat, sit, crawl, walk, talk, form their own opinions, make their demands known and even have the capacity to speak multiple languages. Don’t imagine they can’t understand what “no” means! Say it early and say it kind … but mean it when you say it. Nothing will pay off quicker, better and longer than kind yet firm consistency.
On the top of this yellow sheet of paper we wrote our heading in big letters. It said, “Hammonds’ House Code of Conduct”. Below was a written list of rules to follow along with a punishment assigned to each rule if the rule was broken. The list contained things which would be wrong in anybody’s house and also things which we considered wrong and would not allow from our children in our house.
Lying was on the list … it would get you 2 spats with the well respected, “Rod of Correction”. Stealing was also on the list as was disobedience and being disrespectful. Along with the biggies, there were also some annoyances I wanted to curb. Among these were fussing, whining, allowing the screen door to slam behind you, having to be told twice and getting back up out of bed … which only received 1 spat, never aimed at hurting but only as a consistent form of discipline to remind and train their soul to obey the rules. (Proverbs 22:15; 23:13)
Every time there was an infraction of a rule, Brenda or I would calmly and kindly remind them that the behavior was unacceptable, take them to the door and show them where it was on the list, (providing we were home), ask them to get the “Rod” and bring it to us, administer the proper correction, set them in our lap, verbally forgive them, then pray for them to remember the rules in the future, give them a big confirming hug, put it behind us and forget it.
One night I had to administer that same discipline 21 times in a row to Ashley for getting back up out of bed – and we had company … it was another pastor friend and his wife. They were amazed with the level of kindness and consistency which we administered correction. Years later they commented how it affected them and their image of God as a loving Father who patiently corrects His Children whom He loves. (Hebrews 12:6-11)
You know what the hardest part was? Brenda and I disciplining ourselves to follow the rules. You see, we committed to each other, to God and to our children that we would also follow the rules which demanded each time our children broke one that we stop what we were doing and pay attention to them. Letting it slide because we were too busy would send the message that we were not committed to our word or that they were not important.
You might think that this took a lot of time from our family but you would be mistaken. It so happened in our family and in every family that I have ever seen employ this tool, that if consistently followed by the parents, every home will come into order and be a peaceful and happy place with happier children and healthier relationships within 6 weeks. I would trade 6 weeks of work for a life time of rewards in any arena of life. And, that’s what happened in our home. We realized that we weren’t raising children, we were raising adults – adults who would hopefully one day be raising our grandchildren and perhaps decide what nursing home we live in.
So, if my son disobeyed the rules, I taught him it was wrong and I disciplined him; If my daughter hit her brother, I taught her it was wrong and I disciplined her; If one of them lied, one of us would teach them it was wrong and discipline them; If they disrespected or talked back to their mother, I taught them and disciplined them. Never to hurt them and not one time did I discipline either of my children in anger.
We consistently taught them and disciplined them, not for our own good but for theirs. It was our hope that they would have a good life and it was up to us to give them the keys to this good life.
Today they are sitting here at 32 and 34 years old with kids of their own. You know, I’m not going to punish them for fighting with one another but I sure do hope they don’t … I certainly taught them that it was wrong.
I taught them how to have a good marriage, deal with disappointments, keep a job and manage life – if they don’t, I’m not going to hope they depressed, divorced, get fired or fail in life. In fact, I’m going hope the opposite. I was given to them by God to teach them and guide them in their formative years and to hopefully be a trusted counselor to them for the rest of their life. But, they are no longer little children, they are still my children, but grown children, and I no longer have any desire to punish them. If I hear them cuss, I no longer wash their mouth out with soap – why … because they are no longer under my law – I taught them right and it will be best for them if they do not forsake instructions.
Our rules protect and guard our children while they are children. If they are given no laws, where is their guard? If, when they are older and on their own, they stray from the commandments of their father or the instructions of their mother, it is their choice – but we hope they don’t. (Proverbs 6:20-23)
23 But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
Romans 3:31 Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law.
The whole reason I taught my children right is so that when they grew up they would live right and establish righteousness in the earth.
Once we lived under the penalties, under the punishments, under the curses of the law. (Galatians 3:13) However, when we come to Christ, we are no longer under the law,(Romans 6:14), neither are we expected to become lawless, (Romans 6:1-2), however – God is not out to punish us … but … living without respect to the commandments of God will set a person up for failure in life. God is not the sinner’s enemy, but rather His friend.
God won’t make you fail, but He might allow you to fail … the choices in life are squarely yours. God loves you and hopes you will follow His instructions. That’s grace! But, if you are His Child, He will love you whether you do or don’t!
In case you aren’t sure how the law of God applies to you as a Believer under grace. This Wednesday evening we will begin to discover the New Testament revelation and the grace-filled application of each one of the Ten Commandments.
We will start where Jesus left off talking to the young rich ruler of Matthew 19, with what is referred to as the first table of the law. If you want to study and get ahead, read Exodus, chapter 20.
However, to leave you with something of value to consider this week, let me say: You know right from wrong. (Hebrews 10:16) Stop justifying your wrong decisions like a little kid and start doing what you know is right. (Isaiah 1:16-20)

Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency said "many bodies" had been found along the shoreline of the Indonesian city of Palu on Sulawesi island which was hit by a major quake and a tsunami on Friday.
Disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said the waves reached as high as 6 metres (20 feet) in at least one area, according to a report relayed by a man who called to say he survived only by climbing and clinging to a tree.
Buhari told the Indonesian government that "my administration and the entire people of Nigeria are with you at this difficult and tough moment when you struggle hard to minimise the impact of this tragedy and in your efforts to provide temporary relief and comfort to the affected victims".
The first wave of rescuers and emergency aid arrived yesterday in Palu, Central Sulawesi, as the Indonesian province begins to count its losses after it was hit by a 7.4-magnitude quake a day earlier.
"We are having difficulty deploying heavy equipment to find victims under the rubble of buildings because numerous roads leading to Palu city are damaged".
The festival was in Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi province, which was strewn with debris from collapsed buildings and pooled seawater Saturday.
CNNreports that rescue workers are still searching for survivors after the quake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi and triggered a subsequent tsunami.
The agency on Saturday was widely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, though officials said waves had come within the time the warning was issued.
A remote fishing village is feared to have been wiped out after a 7.5 magnitude natural disaster rocked Indonesia, killing at least 384.
After a local hospital was damaged, medical staff opted to treat dozens of wounded residents just outside the building, Sutopo said.
Injured people are treated outside at Army hospital following earthquakes and a tsunami in Palu, Central Sulawesi.

Almost 400 people have been confirmed dead after a tsunami triggered by a huge natural disaster hit Palu, in Indonesia.
JAKARTA-The death toll from the quake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi jumped to 384 on September 29, authorities said, with many of those killed swept away by giant waves as they played on the beach.
Numerous earthquakes have struck the region in recent months. Even aid deliveries by sea have been a challenge since Palu's port was badly damaged by the tsunami.
The death toll from the massive quake, which sent tsunami waves crashing into the island of Sulawesi, now stands at more than 420, but authorities expect that number to rise sharply as reports come in from remote areas that have been cut off from communication.
"We hope there will be global satellites crossing over Indonesia that can capture images and provide them to us so we can use the images to prepare humanitarian aid", Nugroho said.
An air traffic controller at Palu airport died ensuring a plane took off safely after Friday's quake.
"We're now getting limited communications about the destruction in Palu city, but we have heard nothing from Donggala and this is extremely worrying", he said.
United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said United Nations officials were in contact with Indonesian authorities and "stand ready to provide support as required".

Canada's First Quantum Minerals plans to invest over $1 billion in a new smelter and modernisation of a copper mine in Zambia, a senior Zambian official said on Wednesday, but the company said the investment was "very conditional".
Zambia's high commissioner (ambassador) to South Africa Emmanuel Mwamba told Reuters by telephone that First Quantum Minerals Chief Executive Officer Phillip Pascal had announced the investment on Wednesday when he met Zambian officials attending a mining conference in Cape Town.
First Quantum planned to invest $700 million in a new smelter whose location the company did not specify and $350 million would be invested in modernising its Kansanshi copper mine, Mwamba said.
First Quantum owns 80 percent of the operator of Kansanshi, Africa's largest copper mine in northwestern Zambia.
Clive Newall, First Quantum's president, told Reuters in Canada that the possible new investment was "very conditional".
"Our intentions are at some point to invest a lot of money," Newall told Reuters by telephone, without confirming the $1 billion figure.
"But there are a number of conditions that need to happen before we do that, some of which are our own, you know balance sheet issues," he said. "Some are practical: We are building a very major project in Panama, which is taking up a lot of our energy."
"We need demonstrable fiscal stability in Zambia over a period of time before we do it," he said, summarising what he said First Quantum had told the Zambian officials.
Zambia proposed measures in November to curb its budget deficit at a time when slumping commodity prices have seen the country face mine closures, rising unemployment, power shortages and soaring food prices.
First Quantum had invested $5.7 billion in Zambia as of 2015 with $2.6 billion going into the Kansanshi Mine, $1 billion in the Kansanshi smelter and $2.1 billion in the Trident Project, which includes the Sentinel and Enterprise mines.
First Quantum has asked a Zambian court to dismiss a $1.4 billion claim by a state-owned firm, which accused the Canadian company of irregular transactions with its local subsidiary, according to court papers

Born 26 May 1837 in a manor Macie near Grodno (presently territory of Belarus) of Polish-Lithuanian nobility. His nationality in earlier sources was wrongly quoted as Russian or Hungarian, as it was in case of other prominent Poles who lived in these times. Poland was then divided into three parts being occupied by Russia, Prussia (Germany) and Austro-Hungary.
Having completed his civil engineering studies in 1859 he began working at building the Petersburg - Warsaw railroad line. In 1863 he took part in an uprising against occupying rulers (the so-called January Uprising) and, after the fall of the uprising, to avoid being arrested by Russian tsarist police, he left on ship to Great Britain with passport for the name Leon Warnerke, under which he is well recognized.
He settled in London about 1870 and soon started lively scientific activity in the field of photography, fully devoting himself to that discipline. In his private laboratory he experimented with various chemicals, in attempts to improve light-sensitive layers as well as with camera designs to simplify photographing process.
In 1875 he designed a camera with a special roll cassette, enabling to take 100 images on paper "film". The camera used Warner-invented silver bromide collodion stripping paper "film" and its bellows extension moved on a single rail. An orange-colored glass control window in the back allowed visual numbering the frames.
Warnerke founded manufacturing companies in London and Petersburg to produce his paper "film". However, in spite of excellent photographic results, the high production costs made the enterprises commercially unsuccessful. Also, for some time he published a technical journal.
At the end of 1870s he investigated gelatin silver bromide emulsions and discovered the tanning action of pyrogallol in the development of silver bromide plates. This property was later used in the bromoil process.
For improving production of silver bromide collodion emulsion, he received in 1877 in Belgium a prize from Association Belge de Photograpie. Four years later The Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain awarded him with a Progress Medal for his works. In these years he used to keep contacts with various photographic organizations throughout Europe, giving numerous lectures before the photographic societies of England, France, Belgium and Germany and propagating most recent achievements and novelties from the field of photography. He was the first to bring to England description of Gabriel Lippman's interference method of color photography (a Nober Prize winner in 1908) and to demonstrate the results, or early effects of Lumiere Brothers' works on color photography material called autochrome. He personally introduced in England the Goerz double anastigmat lens, manufactured by C. P. Goerz in Berlin.
The year 1880 brought sensitometer of his design and make, that was marketed in England where it was approved as a standard and used till the end of 1890s. The device using 25-degree scale proved very useful for both photographers and plate manufacturers to determine sensitivity of photographic materials. For example - 'wet collodion plates' average sensitivity equaled 10 Warnerke degrees.
Another type of camera, with improved features of the cassette, was designed in 1881. The paper "film" length was reduced to allow 40 images and it bore kind of perforation (one hole for each frame). The holes served as checking points to electrically control the number of the frames - advancement. Each frame was signaled with an electric ringer powered by a battery located inside the roll holder.
Having been accused, though not sentenced, of passing counterfeit banknotes in 1898, he retired after this to Geneva where he spent rest of his life in almost complete solitude.
All Warnerke's devices, instruments, apparatus and designs that were owned and taken care of by his daughter were lost in Nazi heavy bombing of London during WW II.
Game is so broken - I feel sorry for those who take it seriously - World of Tanks Game Related Discussions - World of Tanks official Asia Forums
The game is so broken at the moment its not funny. No I am not complaining because I am doing badly - that hasn't changed and I do not blame WG but how many times have I been 1 shot only to find that the same tank has hit and penned me 3 times in that last shot! How many times have I been moving rapidly across the field only to hit and be stopped dead by an invisible object..... I'm not even going to talk about the vision mechanics. Does anyone know how to tell the difference between a bush that does work and one that doesn't?
" many times have I been 1 shot only to find that the same tank has hit and penned me 3 times in that last shot!"
Who the [edited] are you? Get Spoofed! "wouldn't be a proper WG balance change if they didn't [edited] something up after all "
To be fair, there has been the issue of "no sound hits" where getting shot at does not produce any sound. Wargaming still hasn't gotten around to fixing it yet, which is annoying.
The open field invisible object thing might be on Tundra, since the rocks there have broken collision models. Which again is stupid.
Wargaming somewhat screwed up vision mechanics with the bushes, I have no idea how they accomplished this.
I seem to recall WG indicating they were aware of the issues and working on them. Sadly their comms has been mostly PR around unpopular stuff like kill pref MM tanks. Would love to hear some good news about them actually fixing stuff for a change.
Side note OP, not sure anyone has taken it seriously in a long while. WG made it pretty clear some time ago that they were going to break balance and most stuff since then has been aimed at PR wins rather than game improvement.
OP, 121 HP will be you firing HE. The other points are valid though, sound registration hits are dodgy since 1.0 & the terrain collision models are not correct in some places. Still, it shouldn't stop you from winning or excelling at the game.

I'd be yoloing, Ezz would be ramming, Robin would tk siggy, everyone else would likely afk at base as we'd struggle to get more than 5 on at one time. Shit did I just let out our master tier 4 strat?" - King Yolo, PBKAC
1. get shot it front sprocket while peaking around a corner, don't get tracked but rather engine sets on fire .
not to mention that multiple bushes suddenly are totally transparent (even if you in LT spotting), not to mention hit boxes than mysteriously hang in space
WOT has become a 3rd rate, badly designed arcade game that essentially only survives because it is click-bait and there are still idiots out there that download and install it. But going by recent registration statistics, that inflow of new player are drying up fast, as fast as you can say "Russian Refund"
Helljumper, Helljumper, where you been? Feet first into hell and back again! When I die please bury me deep! Place an MA5 down by my feet! Don't cry for me, don't shed no tear!
Just pack my box with PT gear! Cuz one early morning 'bout zero-five! The ground will rumble, there'll be lightning in the sky!
To be fair. It was a correct observation. 390 alpha guns don't always do 390 alpha. A big whooosh of course, but not wrong.
I wasn't firing HE unless the game loaded it for me and I don't have adrenalin rush and I don't last long enough to run out of AP.....

(a) our Privacy Policy that sets out how we will respect your privacy and how we use data collected by the Resources;
(e) other Wargaming rules and policies (together with the Game Rules, Forum Rules and Clan Rules, the “Rules”).
2.2. In order to access and use any Game or Game Forum, in addition to accepting this EULA, you must also accept the Privacy Policy and the Rules applicable to the relevant Game and Game Forum.
2.3. You must also accept and comply with all rules of external platforms applicable to the Resources or specific Games, including but not limited to Xbox Games and other Xbox services rules, PlayStation®4 licenses and other Sony rules, Apple Appstore and Game Center rules, and Google Play rules (“Third Party Terms”). Any breach of any Third Party Terms shall be regarded as a fundamental breach of this EULA.
3.1 You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Resources. If you are under the age of 13 or you do not agree to this EULA, then you are not granted a license to use or access the Resources. By agreeing to this EULA, you represent and warrant to us: (i) that you are at least thirteen years of age; and (ii) that your registration and your use of the Resources complies with all applicable laws and regulations.
3.2 You agree that you will not knowingly allow any individual under the age of 13 or other minimum legal age where it differs under local legal requirements to use or access the Resources.
4.1 From time to time, at our sole discretion, we may amend, modify or replace this EULA, for example to reflect new products or services or because of changes in the law, without prior notice. If we make a material change to this EULA, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you and, where required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent. We may provide notice through a pop-up or banner within the Resources, by sending an email to any address you may have used to register for an Account, or through other mechanisms. Material changes to this EULA will take effect upon the earlier of (a) your actual notice or (b) thirty (30) days from posting of such change. If we make a non-material change to this EULA which does not reduce your rights, we will post a new version of this EULA and the new version of this EULA will take effect immediately upon the date of posting. The latest version of this EULA will always be available on the Sites, so we recommend that you check for updates to this EULA each time you use the Resources. If you continue to use the Resources after a new version of this EULA takes effect, then you shall be considered to have accepted the latest version of this EULA (other than for those material changes where your consent is required). Disputes arising under this EULA will be resolved in accordance with the version of the EULA in place at the time the dispute arose. This section does not apply to changes to the Rules that are addressed in Section 4.2.
4.2 From time to time, at our sole discretion, we may also amend, modify or replace the Rules, for example to ensure that the Games and Games Forums operate smoothly and to reflect the needs of the community using the Games and Games Forums. The latest version of the Rules will always be available on the Sites. Any new version of the Rules shall take effect immediately upon the date of posting on the Sites. If you continue to use a Game or Game Forums after a new version of the applicable Rules takes effect, then you shall be considered to have accepted the amended Rules.
5.1.1. In order to use the Resources, you will need to create a Wargaming account. A Wargaming account is a collection of data associated with a particular person that is required for his or her use of the Resources, including authentication (authorization), access to settings, statistics and other information, and use of rights to Additional Features (the “Account”).
5.1.2. To create an Account, you must have an email address and will be required to provide certain information. (The details of the information that you may provide are set out in our Privacy Policy). You agree that you will provide all information truthfully and accurately, so that we have correct details about you and your Account. You will maintain and update this information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.
5.1.3. When creating an Account you will also be required to provide a 'user name' and/or 'persona' to represent you in connection with the Resources. User names and personas are tied to your Account and are non-transferable (meaning they cannot be transferred to anyone else). You may not use a user name or persona that is used by someone else, is vulgar or offensive, imitates any third party, infringes on any proprietary right of any third party, or otherwise breaches this EULA or the Rules. If you have questions about Account registration, please contact us at https://na.wargaming.net/support/ or, for Gods & Glory, support_en@godsandglory.com.
5.1.6. In certain cases, including some iOS and Android Games, you may also log in through some third party system, if expressly permitted in the Game.
5.1.7. Also, if expressly permitted by Wargaming, a “demo account” is possible in certain Games. In this case, you receive no separate username or password. The authorization for the Game is made through the specific technical device (mobile phone, tablet, etc.) that you use.
5.1.8. However, you are strongly advised to set up a standard Account in accordance with the above provisions. If a "demo account" is used, we are not responsible for keeping your progress in the Game, ensuring availability of game items and Additional Features, or maintaining the safety of any monetary or valuable assets in the Account. Cases when an Account and all connected assets may be lost entirely include the loss of the technical device, loss of password or any unauthorized modification of the operating system ("jailbreaking") or of the software.
5.2.1 You must keep all information relating to your Account confidential. At no time should you disclose your account ID or password, secret question or answer to anyone. This includes your friends, relatives, parents, children, spouses, co-workers, clan members and clan leader. In case of such disclosure, clause 5.2.2 will apply.
5.2.2 You are fully responsible for the conduct and actions using your Account and for all breaches of this EULA committed using your Account. We shall have no liability to you for any loss or damage arising from disclosure of your Account data to anyone, any unauthorized use of your Account, or any unauthorized access, use, alteration, modification and/or disclosure of your personal information.
5.2.3 Any sale, purchase, lease, rent, exchange, other commercial exploitation of Accounts is prohibited.
5.3.1 You must ensure that you secure your Account, computer, mobile phone or other device from third party access. Please notify us immediately at https://na.wargaming.net/support/ or, for Gods & Glory, support_en@godsandglory.com if you become aware of:
5.3.2 We may employ certain physical, electronic and managerial procedures designed to help safeguard and prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration, modification and/or disclosure of your personal information. Although we use procedures reasonably designed to safeguard the security of your personal information, transmissions made on or through the Internet and personal information stored on our servers or the servers of third parties that we use are vulnerable to attack and cannot be guaranteed to be secure. In addition, submissions made by email are not protected by encryption and are vulnerable to disclosure to third parties, including due to interception during transmission.
6.1 The software, technology, text, forum posts, chat posts, profiles, widgets, messages, links, emails, music, sound, graphics, pictures, video, data, and all other elements of the Resources, as well as the design and appearance of our Sites and the Games (collectively, the “Content”), provided by Wargaming are protected by all relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights and applicable laws.
6.2 As between you and Wargaming, Wargaming and its licensors own the Content and all of the intellectual property rights in it. Except as expressly authorized by Wargaming, you may not make use of the Content or the Resources. Wargaming and its licensors reserve all rights in and to the Content and the Resources not expressly granted in this EULA. Any unauthorized use of the Content or Resources for any purpose is prohibited.
6.3 Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions herein, Wargaming grants you a personal, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, limited right to access the Content in connection with your access and use of the Resources. Unless and to the extent that we have expressly authorized you in writing, you must not:
6.3.1 copy or download any Content from a Resource (except as part of the proper use or operation of that Resource);
6.3.6 interfere with the proper operation of or any security measure used by the Resources or Content;
6.3.8 use the Resources or Content in a manner that suggests an unauthorized association or is beyond the scope of the limited license granted to you; or
6.4.1 we can only make Content available to you if it is legal for you to have access to that Content in your home country;
6.4.2 you may only obtain Content from us (or from any person or third party that we authorize for this purpose) and you must not obtain Content from any other person or attempt to do so;
6.4.3 we reserve the right to refuse your request(s) to acquire Content, and we also reserve the right to limit or block any request to acquire or obtain Content for any reason;
6.4.5 once you have redeemed or activated Content, including without limitation any Additional Feature, it is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable for other Content, cash, goods or services;
6.4.6 we may change, replace, remove access to or update the Content at any time at our sole discretion; and
6.4.7 we may monitor use of the Resources for a wide variety of different purposes, including preventing cheating and hacking, reducing toxic player behavior and improving the Resources.
7.1 You do not have to pay any registration or subscription fees to create an Account. However, some of the Resources or parts thereof may require you to pay a fee. If you decide to purchase or to subscribe to any such Resources, you must ensure that:
7.1.2 you are the authorized Account holder for the Account from which you are subscribing to the Resources;
7.1.5 you agree to pay all the fees that you incur, including all recurring subscription fees, unless and until you cancel your Account or any particular subscription to any of the Resources in accordance with this EULA.
7.2 Any applicable fees and other charges on your Account are payable in advance and are not refundable. We may, from time to time, without prior notice modify, amend, or supplement payment methods offered within the Resources. We will post those changes in the corresponding section of the relevant Resource(s).
7.3 The final price of the purchase and/or subscription may vary depending on the selected payment method. To see the final price, click the button for the selected payment method. Please check currency exchange fees and charges in case payment currency is different from the currency of the selected payment method.
7.4 Prices for the purchases of the Resources are published in the corresponding section of the relevant Resource(s). Wargaming reserves the right to change the price at any time by making a respective change on the Resource(s). By making a purchase you are considered to demonstrate consent with the price. Price changes for any subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Resources after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the service prior to the price change going into effect. Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.
7.5 We do our best to describe our services, Resources and prices thereof as accurately as possible. However, we are human, and therefore we do not warrant that product specifications, pricing, or other content on the Resources is complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free. In the event of any errors relating to the pricing or specifications, Wargaming shall have the right to refuse or cancel any purchase or subscription in its sole discretion. If we charged your credit card or other account prior to our cancellation, we will issue a refund in the amount of the charge. If you have already used your purchase or subscription has already expired, Wargaming reserves the right to block access to your Account until you reimburse the full price of the corresponding Resource(s). If a subscription or service you purchased from Wargaming is not as described, your sole remedy is to cancel the purchase and receive a refund in the amount of the purchase price.
7.6 Please remember that your Account is personal to you and cannot be transferred or traded with any other user.
8.1 Additional Features. The Resources may permit you to acquire and accumulate rights to certain additional virtual game content, features and functionalities (including rights to in-game assets and points) as made available by Wargaming (“Additional Features”) which you are granted a license to use pursuant to the terms of this EULA. Additional Features constitute a limited, non-transferable, revocable right to use features of the Resources when, as, and if allowed by Wargaming and solely as governed by and permitted under this EULA. Subject to this EULA, Additional Features may be exchanged for access to upgraded features, may be exchanged for other Additional Features, or used in connection with other features made available by Wargaming through the Resources. Additional Features are not real-world currency, have no monetary value, and cannot be used, exchanged, or redeemed except as provided in this EULA, and cannot be transferred, in any case. For avoidance of doubt, Additional Features are not redeemable or refundable for any sum of money or monetary value from Wargaming or any third party at any time; provided, however, if and to the extent that any Additional Features are determined by applicable law to constitute real world currency or property, then they are the property of Wargaming.
8.2 Acquiring Additional Features. You may accrue Additional Features in a variety of ways. Wargaming may distribute or provide access to Additional Features in exchange for taking certain actions (either directly within the Resources, or in connection with a third party service), for a fee, or without any fee or required action, in its sole discretion. Wargaming may charge fees for the right to exercise rights associated with Additional Features. You agree that you do not "own" the Additional Features and that Wargaming has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Additional Features in its sole discretion, in any general or specific case, and that Wargaming will have no liability to you based on its exercise of such right. Wargaming allows you to accumulate and manage your Additional Features, and may use terms such as "buy" and "sell" to refer to the grant or transfer of rights to use the Resources. Use of terms such as "buy" or "sell" does not indicate any ownership right. The total amount of a purchase may be adjusted by adding a fee, if any, applicable to the payment method you selected and for mandatory tax payments, if any, required by law. If adjusted, the total amount of the purchase will be recalculated automatically and displayed before you confirm the purchase, provided, however, that such functionality is supported by a chosen payment method. If your payment is in a currency other than that of the purchase amount shown on the Site, the exchange rate applied will depend on the selected payment method.
8.3 Additional Terms and Conditions. Without limiting the foregoing, the following rules apply to Additional Features:
8.3.1 Additional Features may only be redeemed for other Additional Features where permitted in the Resources;
8.3.2 Once you have purchased Additional Features, those Additional Features are non-refundable and non-exchangeable (whether or not you use them);
8.3.3 Additional Features cannot be sold or transferred to anyone, but you may buy Additional Features for another user of a Game through the gift shop applicable to that Game;
8.3.4 Additional Features cannot be exchanged for cash or any goods or services (except other Additional Features as permitted in the Resources);
8.3.5 To acquire Additional Features, you need to follow the instructions provided in the Resources; this can include making a payment and providing personal and financial details (which you represent shall be complete and accurate).
8.3.6 The price payable for the Additional Features (including any value added tax or other applicable taxes of duties) will be as set out on our Sites or as part of the Resources (as applicable), but we reserve the right to change the price of Additional Features at any time at our discretion;
8.3.7 We do not make any promises about how or when Additional Features may be available and can update or change Additional Features at any time;
8.3.8 If you receive Additional Features or achievements free of charge, at a lower price or without performing the actions that are normally required for receipt (e.g., experience points without playing the Game) (i) due to a technical error (a bug), you must report this to Wargaming immediately; or (ii) due to hacking, fraud or other illegal actions, you must report this to Wargaming immediately and pay for such Additional Features to the extent already consumed. In each case, Wargaming may delete such Additional Features and achievement without any notice to you and, if you have already consumed the Additional Features, to block access to your Account until you reimburse the full price of the corresponding Additional Feature(s).
8.3.9 You may only acquire Additional Features from us (or from any person that we authorize for this purpose), or from another authorized user of a Game through the use of a feature included in the Game by Wargaming expressly for such purpose (such as a gift through the gift shop applicable to that Game), and you must not obtain Additional Features from any other person or in any other way or attempt to do so; and
8.4 Non-Refundable Purchase. In the event you purchase Additional Features from Wargaming, we will transfer the Additional Features to you only once that payment has been processed, and you may start using Additional Features as soon as you have completed the purchase process. You therefore have no right to cancel any transaction to purchase Additional Features after completion of the purchase process and being entitled to download the Additional Features.
8.5 Restrictions. You agree and acknowledge that Wargaming may deny or place limitations or restrictions on any purchase, issue, or redemption of Additional Features, individually or with respect to general volume, at any time and for any reason. Wargaming may halt, suspend, discontinue, or reverse any Additional Features transaction (whether proposed, pending or past) in cases of actual or suspected fraud, violations of other laws or regulations, or deliberate disruptions to or interference with the Resources, or the service of any affiliated or related third party.
8.6.1 As of the latest ToS update, gifts are only available in World of Tanks, World of Warplanes and World of Warships. Please check for updates.
8.6.2 Please note that gifts can be made within the same game server region only, i.e., gifts from an account on the North America server cannot be made to players on the EU server.
8.6.3 Within 24 hours after a gift is sent, the recipient will receive a notification via email. To receive a gift, the recipient must go to the My Gifts page in the Premium Shop and accept the gift.
8.6.4 A recipient may accept or decline a gift. A recipient has 30 days to accept a gift. If it is not accepted within this period, the sender will automatically receive compensation to their account as in-game currency equal to the price of the gift as at the time of purchase.
8.6.5 Within 24 hours after a recipient accepts or declines a gift, the sender will receive a notification via email.
8.6.6 If a recipient of a gift already owns a vehicle included in the gift, that vehicle's full cost in gold as at the time of purchase in the Premium Shop will be automatically compensated to the recipient. The vehicle will not be transferred to the recipient's account.
8.6.8 If the sender of a gift cancels the payment or fails to pay after the recipient accepts the gift, both accounts will be blocked until the circumstances are clarified. Please do not accept gifts from unknown senders.
9.1 This section relates to any fan web site that you may create or operate regarding any of our Games or Resources (collectively, "Fansites," and each a "Fansite").
9.2 At some of our Sites we expressly designate certain Content, such as Wargaming game-related images, graphics or artwork and trademarks, as being "for fansite use" (for example see: https://worldoftanks.com/en/news/announcements/world-tanks-fansite-kit/). In this EULA we refer to this specifically designated Content as "Fansite Content".
9.3 Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Wargaming grants you a non-exclusive, revocable, personal, non-transferable and limited license to reproduce and display Fansite Content on Fansites owned and operated by you and solely for non-commercial purposes. This license is further conditional upon you complying with the following provisions:
9.3.1 you acknowledge and agree that Wargaming retains ownership of the Fansite Content, and any and all derivative works thereof, and has the right to amend, delete, add to or otherwise modify, or to revoke the foregoing license with respect to, any items of Fansite Content at any time;
9.3.2 you agree to include Wargaming's trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights notices when displaying Fansite Content if we request you to do so and in the manner that we request you to do so;

9.3.6 the Fansite will not post material that is disparaging, illegal or infringes on the rights of any third party or that damages (or that might damage) the reputation of Wargaming or of any of the Games;
9.3.7 except as expressly permitted in this EULA, you shall not rent, lease, reproduce, modify, translate the Fansite Content, or make an adaptation of (including without limitation fiction or visual art), or in any way exploit, any of the Content without our express written permission; and
9.3.8 you must not make, or seek to make, any commercial use or profit out of the Fansite Content (including for example by selling subscriptions to your Fansite) without our prior written consent.
9.4 If you fail to comply with any of the terms set out in this section, we reserve the right to terminate your license over the Fansite Content and also to close your Account.
9.5 All goodwill arising from your use of Fansite Content, including from use of any trademarks owned by Wargaming, shall inure solely to the benefit of Wargaming.
10.1 General. Some Resources permit you to create or upload content which you own, have created or otherwise have appropriate rights in (which we refer to in this EULA as "User Generated Content" or "UGC"). UGC includes, for example: Account personas, forum posts, chat posts, voice chat, messenger type features, profile content and any other content or materials contributed by users to, on, or through the Resources. If Wargaming believes that your use or uploading of UGC breaches any of the terms and conditions set forth herein, then Wargaming may remove, block, edit, move or disable such UGC in its sole discretion. If you contravene any of the terms and conditions herein, Wargaming reserves the right to suspend or permanently remove availability of your UGC and to take any other steps that we consider appropriate.
10.2 License Grant to Wargaming. By posting or publishing UGC, you grant Wargaming a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free right and license (with the right to sublicense) to host, store, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify, and distribute your UGC, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels (now known or hereafter developed). Any such use of your UGC by Wargaming may be without any compensation paid to you.
10.3 License Grant to Other Users. By posting and sharing UGC on the Resources or otherwise with another user of the Resources, you hereby grant that user a non-exclusive license to access and use such UGC as permitted by this EULA and the functionality of the Resources.
10.4 You are solely responsible for your UGC and the consequences of posting or publishing UGC. By posting or publishing UGC on or through the Resources, you affirm, represent, and warrant that:
10.4.1 any part of the UGC which comprises or incorporates any of our intellectual property rights remains our property and, as between us and you, we own the UGC which you create that is a derivative work of our intellectual property rights;
10.4.2 you are the creator of or otherwise own the rights in the UGC that you make available to or through the Resources, or, for any UGC that is owned by a third party, you have the express authorization of such third party to upload such UGC to or through the Resources;
10.4.3 no item of UGC that you upload infringes the intellectual property rights or privacy or any other rights of anyone else or is illegal or breaches this EULA;

10.4.6 you must not in any way claim or suggest that any UGC is endorsed, supported by, or affiliated with us; and
10.4.7 Your use of the Resources or Content, including the UGC you upload, complies with all applicable laws and legislation and is not harmful, offensive, defamatory, sexually explicit, obscene, violent, threatening, harassing, abusive, falsely representative of your persona, invasive of someone else’s privacy, illegal or likely to cause any reputational loss or embarrassment to Wargaming or its affiliates.
11.1 We are always pleased to hear from our users and welcome specific comments about our Resources. Unfortunately, however, our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions or materials other than those we have specifically requested. The aim of this policy is to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects that we develop might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we must, regretfully, ask that you do not send us any original creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts or other information such as game ideas or original artwork ("Submissions").
11.2 Any and all Submissions that you send to us, whether at our specific request or notwithstanding our request that you do not do so, shall be deemed, and shall remain, our property from the time of uploading or transmission.
11.3 Accordingly, you hereby assign to Wargaming (including as a present assignment of future rights) all intellectual property rights in Submissions that you send to us to the extent owned by you. If for any reason this assignment is not effective, then you agree that Wargaming shall have a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, combine with other materials, publish, distribute, create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, sublicense (including, without limitation, to third party media channels, platforms, and distributors), publicly perform, publicly display, and otherwise use and exploit in any manner whatsoever, or grant third parties the right to do any of the foregoing, all or any portion of your Submissions, for any purpose whatsoever in all formats, on or through any means or medium now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed, and to advertise, market, and promote the same. You further irrevocably grant us the right, but not the obligation, to use your name in connection with your Submissions. You also agree to waive any right of approval for our use of the rights granted herein and agree to waive any moral rights that you may have in any Submissions, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. To the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the granted rights. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, you also waive any moral rights or rights of a like nature that you may have in such Submissions.
11.4 You understand that you will not receive any fees, sums, consideration, or remuneration for any of the rights granted in this section. Our receipt of your Submissions is not an admission of their novelty, priority, or originality, and it does not impair our right to existing or future intellectual property rights relating to your Submissions. You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary rights, licenses, consents, and permissions to grant us the rights granted in this section.
12.1 The Rules set out how we expect you to behave when using any of the Games or Games Forums. Please review the Rules carefully before using any of the Games or Games Forums. We may take appropriate disciplinary measures, including account termination and deletion, for inappropriate behavior including, but not limited to:

Your obligation to keep the alpha/beta games confidential will continue until we publicly distribute, or otherwise disclose to the public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you are testing.
18.3 If Wargaming notifies you that you have been selected as an alpha/beta tester for an applicable alpha/beta game, you are invited to play the alpha/beta game for the sole purpose of evaluating the alpha/beta game and identifying errors. Nothing in this EULA or the Sites shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges of any kind with respect to the alpha/beta games. THE ALPHA/BETA GAMES ARE PROVIDED FOR TESTING ON AN "AS IS" BASIS AND WE MAKE NO WARRANTY TO YOU OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
18.4 When playing certain alpha/beta games, you may accumulate or have access to Additional Features or other features referred to as treasure, experience points, equipment, or other value or status indicators.

If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness) when exposed to flashing lights, consult your doctor prior to playing. We advise that parents should monitor the use of video games by their children.

You agree that you are responsible for your use of the Resources, and you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Wargaming and its affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, consultants, and agents (collectively, the "Wargaming Entities") from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to, use of, or alleged use of the Resources; (ii) your violation of this EULA or any representation, warranty, or agreements referenced herein, or any applicable law or regulation; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your Submissions; (v) your use of a Third Party Service; (vi) any misrepresentation by you or (vii) any disputes or issues between you and any third party. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (and without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to such matter), and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim. You will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent. This provision does not require you to indemnify us for any unconscionable commercial practice by us or for our fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Resources.
This EULA and any dispute, claim or obligation (whether contractual or non-contractual) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and Wargaming agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Alameda County, California, USA for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.
25.1 Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Wargaming in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Wargaming agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this EULA shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this EULA, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this EULA. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS EULA, YOU AND WARGAMING ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
25.2 Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection 25.1, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.
25.3 Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Wargaming will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this EULA, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Wargaming.
25.4 Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("Notice"). Wargaming's address for Notice is: Wargaming Group Limited, 105, Agion Omologiton Avenue, Nicosia 1080, Cyprus. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Wargaming may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Wargaming shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Wargaming shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Wargaming in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.
25.5 Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with this EULA, Wargaming will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Alameda County, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Wargaming for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
25.7 Modifications. In the event that Wargaming makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Wargaming's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Wargaming's address for Notice, in which case your account with Wargaming shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.
25.8 Enforceability. If Subsection 25.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 25 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 25 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 25 shall govern any action arising out of or related to this EULA.

You hereby waive any applicable statutory and common law that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter. The summaries of provisions and section headings are provided for convenience only and shall not limit the full Terms. Wargaming may assign its rights and obligations under this EULA and any applicable Rules, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice.

28.3 Complete Agreement; No Waiver. This EULA, and any applicable Rules, reflect our complete agreement regarding the Resources and supersede any prior agreements, representations, warranties, assurances or discussion related to the Resources. Except as expressly set forth in this EULA or any applicable Rules, (i) no failure or delay by you or Wargaming in exercising any of rights, powers, or remedies under will operate as a waiver of that or any other right, power, or remedy, and (ii) no waiver or modification of any term of this EULA or any applicable Rules will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver or modification is sought to be enforced.

Both entities are referred to as “Wargaming”, “we”, “our” and “us” in this Policy. The term “Services” refers to the act of providing you with the opportunity to use the named games (“Games”), websites (“Sites”), Wargaming account ("Account"), any of our other products and services (including support services, forums) related to the Games ("Ancillary Services"), for example, the “World of Tanks Assistant” application.
We process personal data only when necessary for the performance of a contract with you. Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or based on our legitimate interests, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms for which require the protection of your Personal Data.
Our legitimate interests are to provide our Services in an effective, safe and harmless manner. We want to provide everyone with a fair and balanced experience when using our Services.
You can choose how we use your Personal Data using our Account Management Tool. As we need to verify your identity before we follow your instructions on Personal Data use, you need to have a registered Account in order to access the Account Management Tool. This means that if you are using a demo version of the Account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you complete the Account here.
• opt-out of receiving direct marketing, offered via email, within Games and online. Read more below in Section 7.1 “Opt-Out of Direct Marketing and Right to Object”;
have your Account, and the related Personal Data, deleted. Read more below in Section 7.4 “Right to erasure”.
We and our employees understand the need for user privacy, and we maintain reasonable and appropriate security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Data.
We may share Personal Data with our affiliates, subsidiaries, vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy. For example, we may hire companies to assist with protecting and securing our systems or services. Any vendor or agent that we retain must comply with our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. Those companies may be located outside of the European Economic Area. Read more in Section 6 “How we share your information”.
We recognise that we have a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. We will not knowingly collect Personal Data from any child, or process such information, without parental consent. For the purpose of this Policy, a child means any individual who is under the age of 18 (or the minimum legal age to consent to the collection and processing of Personal Data where this is different under applicable law).
We keep most of your Personal Data gathered and processed for the purposes described in this Policy for as long as you continue to use our Services, e.g. you have an activated Account in one of our Games. We will delete your Personal Data after you request your Account deletion and the grace period of 45 (forty-five) calendar days, during which we can restore your Account, expires. The process of erasing your Personal Data can take up to one month from expiry of the grace period and, considering the complexity and number of requests, may be extended by a further two months. Read more in Section 7.3 “Right to erasure”.
Some of the Games do not use the Account. You will not be able to exercise your rights with regard to those Games through the Account Management. For this reason, we are offering you other tools to export your Personal Data, delete it, and object to our use of your Personal Data in accordance with Section 7 “Your rights”, as well as to manage your subscriptions.
Also, there are some differences in the Personal Data that we collect about users of the Games for which the Account is created and users of other Games. For example, we do not collect your phone number and email address if you use the Games for which the Account is not created.
With regard to the Games that do not use the Account, you can exercise your rights by filing a request to that effect to Customer Support or as otherwise indicated in the respective Game.
Finally, you may link some of the Games that do not use the Account to your Account (where such function is available). Please note that control over your Personal Data in such Games is separate from control over your Personal Data relating to your Account. For example, to delete your Personal Data in “World of Warships Blitz” you will need to contact Customer Support as suggested in this Game, while deletion of the Personal Data relating to your Account shall be performed through the Account Management.
In relation to your use of our Services, we gather information either directly from you (when you provide information to us) or indirectly (e.g. through our Site’s technology).
We collect Personal Data and other information that you voluntarily provide. It is entirely your decision to provide the requested information. However, your use of certain Services is possible only if you provide required information, e.g. while creating an Account.

In order to provide you with efficient services, we need to collect, store and use various information about your activity in our Games. “Game-Related Information” includes your in-game identifier, which for most of our Games is known as “Wargaming ID”, as well as what is usually referred to as “game statistics”. By game statistics we mean information about your Games preferences, progress in the Games, participation in clans, frequency of playing, as well as information about the device you are using the Services on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings. Precise GPS location from mobile devices is collected only with your permission. Wi-Fi and IP addresses received from your browser or device may be used to determine approximate location.
We may also collect certain data (like IP address, username, etc.) that is required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and EULA violations. This data is used only for the purposes of detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game, and is deleted six months after its collection, unless the data can be used to prove that cheating has occurred. If the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud or EULA violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations. Please note that the specific data stored for this purpose may not be disclosed to you or any third parties, since the disclosure will compromise the mechanism through which we detect, investigate and prevent cheating in the Game, as well as other EULA violations.
We may use the information made publicly available, e.g. through YouTube, vk.com, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, in order to find out your opinion about Games and Services, so that we could take them into account while improving our Services.
In order to fulfil our obligation under the EULA and when processing is required in order to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject, we may also obtain information about you from our partners, e.g. from our payment and advertising partners. We also use your identifiers on other platforms like PlayStation®4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One, so that you can play our games through these platforms. We only use the data controlled by our partners in accordance with their instructions and applicable laws. When you purchase virtual items, virtual currency (so-called "gold") or time-limited premium memberships with your credit card, we may receive from our payment partners and process a part of your credit card number, information about your credit card issuer, as well as your full address for billing purposes.
We need to process your Personal Data in order to fulfil the contract with you according to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. As a user, we will use your Personal Data, unless otherwise prohibited by law, for the following purposes:
to communicate with you about your Account or transactions with us and send you information about features on our Sites or changes to our policies;
to provide support including, but not limited to, product updates, product patches and fixes and other similar communications;
to arrange your travel, receipt of gifts and awards, to which you may be entitled as a result of winning an offline competition, etc.
We will use your Personal Data for our legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR to notify you and provide you with information about features on our Sites, new product releases and service developments and to advertise our products and services in accordance with this Policy. Namely, once you have created an Account we may use your email address, nickname, IP address, mobile phone number, in order to send you emails, messages and targeted in-game and web offers about Games. Also, if you opt-in, we will send you emails, messages and targeted in-game and web offers about Wargaming offline events, co-projects of Wargaming and its partners, as well as about Wargaming games, not using Wargaming ID.
We analyse the Tracking Data, Content Data and Game-Related Information to identify how to improve the Services and our operations to make them more interesting for our players in general. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys and you have choices about the information you provide.
We may also use the Game-Related Information to send you certain in-game offers that we believe are the most useful to you. To make the offer we first collect Game-Related Information from various players, identify patterns in their behaviour, and create algorithms that identify whether you follow the pattern, if we apply the algorithm and it says that you do actually follow the pattern – we send the in-game offer to you. We make sure that such offers never have any significant impact on you or our other players. For example, we may notice that you are a player who is very good at playing with French vehicles and has registered the account more than five years ago: so, we may specifically offer you the new French vehicle for rent, but in any case not more expensively than it is offered to other users. You can unsubscribe from in-Game offers through our Account Management tool.
We use the information required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and violations of EULA and Game rules and policies only for the purposes of such detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game. If the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud or EULA violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations.
For the performance of a contract with you, compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, and based on our legitimate interests, we may share your personal data with the following categories of third parties:
Payment partners: we share your email address, IP address, information about in-game purchases requested by you at Wargaming’s web-sites, and other information you provide to us for the purpose of fulfilling your purchase requests with such companies as Adyen BV, PW Inc., PayPal (Europe) Sarl & Cie, "Yandex.Money", NBCO LLC;
Advertising and advertising measurement partners: we share your email, nickname, IP address and other information you provide to us in order to facilitate targeting, delivery, and measurement of online advertising on third-party services, or otherwise facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, or of interest to you, with such companies as Emarsys UK Ltd, Unity Technologies APS;
Data storage partners: we store some of your information using third-party data storage services, e.g. we store most of your responses to our in-game questionnaires using the services of Widgix, LLC dba Survey Gizmo, while some of your game statistics is stored using the services of Amazon Web Services, Inc.;
Research partners: we may provide access to some of your data, such as your Game statistics, to provide marketing-related and other research. We share anonymous data with our partners unless your personal data is necessary for the requested services or research;

Such companies may get access to your personal data, including personal data that you may provide in your customer support requests. Such partners include Zendesk Inc, iOpex Technologies Inc.;
Developers of applications based on the Game: we make your nickname and some of your Game statistics available to other players and our partners through Public API. The data can be used for developing and support of the applications created by the Game community, mobile applications, e.g. World of Tanks Assistant. Public API enables us to improve your gaming experience, fulfil potential of our community, and put use of our players’ statistics under our control by creating rules and requirements for their use by other players and community;
Publicly available information: our Sites may also have message boards, forums and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with each other. When posting a message to a board, forum or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line; therefore, you are doing so at your own risk. If your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, please use our Account Management tool to request its removal. If we may not be able to remove your personal information promptly, we will let you know about the reasons.
External moderators and testers: some limited data about you (such as your nickname, content of customer support ticket) may become available to third party volunteering moderators and testers who contribute to providing you with better Services, e.g. to quickly respond to your questions about the Games.
Anti-cheat and anti-fraud companies: we may share the information required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Games and EULA violations only for the purposes of detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game.
Wargaming subsidiaries and affiliates: as a global company, we collect information that may be processed in our offices worldwide. Your information may also be processed outside of the European Economic Area, e.g. in the United States, the Republic of Belarus, or any other country in which we, our affiliates or subsidiaries maintain presence.
Change of control: we may share your data as part of our company’s sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any entity which buys us, or part of our business will have the right to continue using your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
When your personal data is shared with Wargaming affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as third parties outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, Wargaming guarantees an adequate level of personal data protection, including but not limited to, by entering into standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission with Wargaming affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as such third parties. We will provide you with a copy of the standard data protection clauses upon your request.
Sharing anonymous information. We also may share anonymous information, i.e. information which does not directly or indirectly disclose your identity, and aggregated information (meaning information about groups and categories of users, including game statistics and behaviour, but which does not identify and that cannot reasonably be used to identify any individual user) with our advertising partners. We may also allow our advertisers to collect anonymous information and aggregated information within the Services and they may then share that information with us. Our advertisers may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. This enables our advertisers to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Services and on the websites of third parties, so that they can try to serve you with advertisements for products and services that are most likely to be of interest to you. Advertisers will also use this information to monitor, improve or modify their operations.
To allow you to exercise your data protection rights in a simple way we have improved the Account Management. If you are using a demo account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you create the Account here or – for Console Games – here. This means that if you are using a demo version of the Account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you complete the Account here.ef="http://wargaming.net/">here. Please visit it to make choices about which direct communications you would like to receive, as well as to exercise your rights to data access, data erasure and objection to data processing.
You can manage your subscriptions to direct marketing through our Account Management tool. Please note that even if you unsubscribe from all our emails, messages, in-game and web-offers, we may still send you some notifications (we often refer to them as “transactional”), e.g. to confirm purchases or changes in your Account, give warranty or security information, information about changes to the EULA, Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We will be able to stop all communications only after your Account is deleted. Also, even after you have unsubscribed from our in-game and web offers, you may still see them within the Games and on some web-sites: that would mean that such offers are shown to everyone and are not specifically directed to you.
You can opt-out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications, including our mobile Games, by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and selecting "limit ad tracking" (Apple iOS) or "opt-out of interest-based ads" (Android).
Where processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, you can use your right to object at any time. If you object we will no longer process your Personal Data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing or the data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold about you, i.e. the right to require free of charge (i) information whether your Personal Data is retained, (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the Personal Data retained. You can use the right to access to your Personal Data through the “Data Export” tool available in the Account Management tools. Normally, we provide the duplicate of the Personal Data retained within 30 (thirty) days upon your request. Once the archive with the Personal Data we retain is ready, you will be able to download in it from our resources. If the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the request. We also will not be able to provide you with some Personal Data that you may post or provide using our Services regardless of our request not to provide the Personal Data in this particular field, website, etc.
You control which nickname, email, phone number, country, social networks accounts, trusted sites and payment methods we associate with your Account. If they change, please modify the data in the Personal Account directly. Please inform us if any of the Personal Data we retain about you is inaccurate.
You have the right to obtain deletion by us of Personal Data concerning you by deleting your Account via our “Account Deletion” tool available in the Account Management tools.
As a result of deleting your Account, you will lose access to most Services, including the Account and Game-Related Information linked to the Account, subscriptions to Wargaming forums and the possibility to access other services you are using the Account for.
Grace period. We allow you to restore your Account during a grace period of 45 (forty-five) days from the moment you request deletion of your Account. This functionality allows you not to lose various Game-Related Information and other important information and options by mistake. During the suspension period, we will be able to finalise financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the Account deletion request.
Complicated Account deletion. In some cases, deletion of your Account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated. Namely, if you are a clan commander in the Games, it is highly likely that you will only be able to delete your Account after you have transferred the clan and placed it under the command of another user or dissolve the clan. In some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer than two further months.
Earlier Personal Data deletion. We store most Personal Data we retain about you until you request deletion of your Account through the Account Management tools. However, certain Personal Data is deleted even while you have a valid Account. For example, we will delete:
your Contact Data, clothes sizes, colour preferences, etc., you have provided for customisation, or for us to send you an award or arrange travel to one of our events, within 30 (thirty) days of us sending the award to your address;
the data about you that we have collected in the course of alpha-tests, super tests, UX tests, surveys, analysis of publicly available sentiments in social networks such as YouTube, Facebook, vk.com for the period when
we are generating the reports for our Services improvement and for 30 (thirty) days after that; technical logs such as records of communication between Services, access logs, errors logs: normally within 30 (thirty) days from their creation.
Information we retain. Upon expiry of the suspension period we will delete all Personal Data about you, except for the data that are required for our compliance with the requirements of applicable laws (e.g. tax and accounting requirements) or for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and EULA violations. We will retain anonymous information after your Account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g. through in-Games chats, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members copied out of our Services. Groups content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g. search engine results) until they refresh their cache.
We may change this Policy from time to time for various reasons, such as legal and regulatory changes, changes in industry practices and technological developments that need to be reflected.
1.01. In order to register, players must be thirteen (13) years of age or older. All players are solely responsible for their behavior in both public and battle chat. Players are responsible for protecting their accounts from access by others, and are strongly encouraged to select a hard-to-guess password and not re-use that password on any other sites where it may be read by the owners or administrators of that site. It is highly discouraged for users to share accounts with others. In the case of an account that has been lost or hacked, please inform technical support immediately through their website, Support.
If you are under 13 years of age or other minimum legal age where it differs under local legal requirements, please ask your parent or guardian to review and approve this EULA on your behalf.

Accounts terminated by Wargaming.net for any type of abuse, including without limitation a violation of these rules or the EULA, will not be reactivated for any reason. For purposes of explanation and not limitation, most account suspensions, terminations and/or deletions are the result of violations of these rules, the End User License Agreement (EULA), or other Wargaming.net policy. Players may cancel any account registered to themselves at any time by following the instructions on the Website. Wargaming.net may stop offering and/or supporting any service at any time.
1.05. Players who decide to be involved with the game acknowledge and agree to these and all other relevant rules and will abide by them regardless of the circumstances.

The account owner will not be entitled to a refund of any currency or any form of credit.
1.06. Administration does not bear responsibility for any inter-clan relationship. It is at sole discretion of clan leaders, their deputies, and officers to carefully choose clan members (especially whilst assigning clan members to important offices such as the clan treasury). By assigning a clan member to a respective office clan leader confirms his confidence in the member. Privates, from their side, confirm that they accept clan rules and regulations by entering the respective clan.

4. Inappropriate conduct in game / Fair play principles The following actions are prohibited in game:
4.03. Intentionally blocking (blocking from front and rear) vehicles belonging to a player on the same team.
4.04. Intentionally propping (blocking on one side, where the other side of a user's vehicle touches a fixed indestructible obstacle, preventing free movement.) vehicles belonging to a player on the same team.
4.05. Intentionally informing participants of the opposing team through battle, or voice chat, the location of vehicles belonging to players of the same team.
4.06. Intentionally exploiting the physics system to damage an allied tank, plane, ship or similar actions. This includes, but is not limited to, pushing an allied tank into line of fire, pushing allied tanks off of cliffs, bridges, into water, etc.
4.07. Using bots, clickers, macros, keyboard and mouse recorders, or any other similar methods to accumulate credits and experience without the participation or with passive participation of the player within the battle (excessive and repetitive passive play).
The "Automated Anti-TD/TK Reporting System" is the system that actively scans the game logs searching for players who massively cause damage to vehicles of their own team (team damage), or intentionally destroy vehicles of their teammates (team kill).
Please note that the Automated Anti-TD/TK Reporting System is not available in certain Games, for instance, World of Tanks Blitz, World of Warplanes and World of Warships. In such cases, please contact us through https://na.wargaming.net/support/.
5.01. Based on combat logs for a particular period of time, usually several days, the automated system finds players involved in friendly fire and team kill incidents. The calculations are quite complicated and the main factor that is taken into account is damage inflicted to allies to total damage ratio.
5.02. If the above ratio for a particular user exceeds a certain fixed threshold value, the system identifies the user as a violator, since his main target is doing damage to allied vehicles.
5.03. If the damage ratio for such user exceeds the verifying coefficient, introduced in order to make distinction between intentional and accidental team killers, such user is identified as an offender and goes onto the suspension list.
5.04. While calculating damage to allies / total damage ratio only the battles with team kill/damage incidents are taken into account.
5.05. In connection with the introduction of Automated Anti-TK Reporting System), listed below are set uniform measures that can be taken against offenders:*. First detection of a user as a team killer and team-damager leads to 1 hour game account suspension.*. Second detection of a user as a team killer and team-damager (recidivism) leads to 1 day game account suspension.*. Multiple detections of a user as a team killer and team-damager (systemic recidivism) will resort in escalating suspensions leading to a PERMANENT game account suspension.
The "Automated Anti-Bot Reporting System" is the system that actively scans the game logs searching for players who use automated bots, clickers, macros, keyboard and mouse recorders, or any other similar methods to accumulate credits and experience without the participation or with passive participation of the player.
5.06. In the case of detection of single or short-term signs of use of automated scripts (bot software) in user's logs, user's account is taken under thorough control by the administration. The owner of the account can be informed by special notifications sent to the registered e-mail.
5.07. In case of detection of signs of massive or overt use of automated scripts or botting software in user's logs, the user's account is suspended permanently, with a possibility of suspension being lifted in the future, after the administration conducts a complete rollback of vehicles, achievements, funds (credits) and research except premium tanks, premium consumables, premium shells and gold.
5.08. Automated Anti-Bot Reporting System is not meant to substitute the Technical Support service, the system aims at making their work easier. The most difficult cases thereby will be solved individually via Technical Support service.
In certain Games you will be able to use the Automated Anti-TK Reporting System. In this case, an automated system of violations tracking (team damage, team kill) will operate and the administration draws your attention to the following information - with the introduction of this system, users' complaints about the above mentioned violations will not be considered. From now on all punishments for team damage and team kill incidents will be executed automatically without support service workers' interference. The system has been customized, tested multiple times and currently works correctly. We also draw your attention to the fact that a multitude of all possible circumstances accompanying different violations (including extenuating and aggravating ones) has been taken into consideration. All requests relating to ban cancellation or minimizing the punishment period, laid by the system, will be ignored. Additional information on the automated system of team killers and bot users tracking you will find on this page:
7.01. General chat: The preferred language of the In Game Garage Chat & Company lobby (or General Chat in World of Tanks Blitz) is any of our supported languages (English, Spanish, and Portuguese). Players who wish to communicate in their native language are urged to do so in channels created specifically for their language.
7.02. In Game Battles and other In Game Chats: The preferred language is English, however non-English is allowed. Please be patient with players whose first language may not be your own.
8.01. Repeated violations any area of these Rules or the EULA, including the areas detailed above, will often result in permanent suspension from the game and/or forums.
8.02. This policy is not language-restrictive. Language that falls under this policy will always be subject to the repercussions listed, whether it is inappropriate in English or any other language.
8.03. Players may provide feedback or address any concerns to: Technical Support service (forum and game suspension appeals), website: https://na.wargaming.net/support/.
By creating/joining and/or managing a clan, players of the World of Tanks and World of Warplanes understand, accept and agree that all the rules, agreements, policies and other documents adopted by the players when registered (created accounts) in World of Tanks and World of Warplanes (hereinafter referred to as the "User Agreement") shall apply to creation, entry, management, and other use of the clans in the above mentioned games.

This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:
2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.
3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.
4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.
6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.
7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License.

This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.
11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.
12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.
13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you.

Just thought i'd throw my two cents out there on the matter of ranked. i must admit i was looking forward to it but after getting to rank 5 and only needing 3 chevrons till elite 5 my anger is at boiling point and reading the chat when you're about to loose *edit* I was using kranvagn most of the time and i swear to god almighty if there was 3 arty then all 3 would focus me down every single game without fail untill i was dead, death by a thousand cuts. So i says to myself i'll try arty myself and see what happens, what happens was the next 5 games were city maps and i loose another 5 games, armour is iirelivant in ranked because of all the gold. At the earlier ranks i liked it as people were'nt camping as much and played normal but up higher its an absolute campfest and matches usually time out with even maus and types camping. It also cost me over a million credits to spam gold to get that far so i just cant afford it anymore. Are you guys gonna keep playing all the ranked and if so how the hell do you afford it and keep your sanity while you're at it?

Idk who even think to play ranked anyway? Is not enough of destroyed randoms with all those super HT's like Maus/Types and ofc sky pigs.
And ofc even dumber is to pick Kranvagn in such mode, that tank have problems to pen T9 HT's and you take it to play vs so many Types and Mauses driving around?
You're right its pen is garbage even with gold but on some maps its an instant top 3 win or loose due to hull down inpenetrable turret and i dont have a type or maus.
I havnt bothered with ranked battles yet... Dont plan on doing so, this whole thing is just ridiculous.
Iam playing them just for the sweet reserves (including 5x 50% credit boosters for 2 hours) which are imo worth the day or two of grinding. And NO you dont really need prem ammo if you dont want to use it. Play a medium and 80% of tanks you meet are other mediums.
U have mentioned 1 of them.....u got enough of this sh**. And enough players who wants the Equipment will buy them.
Dont worry Im sure WG will figure out how to power creep the E-25, then theyl sell it again after hyping it up.
except bonds and improved equipment can be used in randoms, giving an unfair advantage to those who do play ranked battles.
"but after getting to rank 5 and only needing 3 chevrons".... is that why you play?... to get imaginary medals?... that is poor excuse to torture yourself....
if you want to prove you are better you have to do it against all ods, thats the point of this whole mode.... but all in all its no different to randoms so i refuse to play it until there is BIG reward for being the best.... like a new tank....
So you want to play it in order to get something that you just described as giving an unfair advantage, but you don't enjoy the play.
I guess there are many players who aren't bothering with Ranked Battles, or just aren't good enough to win the bonds. The first are probably not whinging about RB's and the second probably are.
I played the first day of Ranked , considered it a pathetic waste of time and credits . It wasn't 1 bit enjoyable even though I made credits
Yeah add an improved rammer and chocolate on your E-25, with such a crazy RoF, you'll be out of ammo in the first minute and half of the game
Haven't played a single ranked battle (might have partially something to do with the fact that I haven't bothered about buying a tier 10 tank yet).
Youre probably listening to the wrong players, the improved equipment gives rather tiny bonuses. Go on tanks.gg and compare a few tanks with normal and improved equipment and see for yourself. If Ranked really pisses you off that much, you'll probably conclude that its not worth your effort.
I have about 10 tier 10 tanks in my garage, b7t i just can't be bothered with ranked. I get tired just thinking about the tedium of ranked.

The parts of the word say, “power over oneself.” All the major philosophers placed great value on this characteristic. Paul used it in his speech before Felix, probably from the Greek philosophical point of view, then reasoned that judgment would come upon those who were not. This same self-control is both given by the Spirit and something in which we seek to abound.
In the early twentieth century, this term became the watch-word of the Prohibition movement, so became identified with not consuming alcoholic beverages. Hence, more modern translations have switched to self-control.

Albania: ten more PV projects up to 2 MW apply for regulated tariff of €100/MWh, Emiliano Bellini, 23 October 2017
In addition to ten project proposals for solar parks not exceeding 2 MW, the Albanian Ministry of Energy and Industry has also accepted an application for a 5 MW PV facility.
The Albanian Ministry of Energy and Industry has published on its website a new list of PV projects of up to 2 MW that are applying for the regulated tariff of €100/MWh. This is the government’s offering in the frame of its support scheme for small and medium hydro- power plants, solar projects not exceeding 2 MW in size, and wind projects not larger than 3 MW.
An inaugural 2 MW project, submitted by Gega & Maska Sh.p.k., is planned for the municipality of Kaninë, near Valona, and is expected to be built at a cost of €1.68 million. A second 2 MW project was presented by Solar Renewable Energy Sh.P.K. and is planned for construction in Topojë, in Fier county, thanks to an investment of around €1.75 million.
Another 1.75 MW facility is being proposed by 3AD Energy Sh.P.K. for the area of Seman, also in Fier county, at a cost of €2.2 million, while two more 2 MW projects, both with a required investment of €2 million each, were proposed by Favina Sh.P.K and Favina 1 Sh.P.K. for the counties of Fier and Korçë, respectively. Favina 1 Sh.P.K. has also submitted another 2 MW solar project worth a €2 million investment, in partnership with Artyka 2 Sh.P.K., that is expected to be constructed in the municipality of Lushnjë, which is also in Fier county. Another 2 MW/€2 million project is also being proposed in the Korçë county by Hidrocentrali Qarr & Kaltany Sh.P.K.
Meanwhile, local developer Max Energy Sh.P.K. has submitted approval request for a 2 MW solar facility to be built near Himare, in the Vlorë country, at a cost of €1.92 million, and Solar Expert Sh.P.K has applied for a 1.98 MW project requiring an investment of €2.7 million and located in the Durrës County. The last and tenth proposal, submitted by Solarium Sh.P.K. is for a 1.99 MW solar park planned for the municipality of Vorë, in Tirana county, which is expected to be built at a cost of €2.7 million.
On top of this, the Ministry of Energy and Industry has also accepted to review a proposal submitted by a consortium formed by Eurohitech Sh.P.K., Norway Winds AS and B.Lamce Sh.P.K. for a 5 MW solar plant in the area of Bashkia e Lushnjës. It is unclear, however, is this project is entitled to apply for the regulated tariff.
Bewteen August and July, the Albanian government had received seven similar projects proposals for solar parks up to 2 MW. In early August, the Albanian energy regulator ERE established that the regulated tariff for solar for 2017 will be €100 ($117.8)/MWh, while for wind power it will be €76/MWh. Solar and wind projects selected under the scheme will be eligible to receive the tariff after the Ministry of Energy has reviewed and approved them. It remains unclear, however, what the criteria for the selection of the projects will be. These will be likely treated as small and medium hydropower projects, which, under the current regulation, can sell power at the regulated tariff to the Albanian public power utility OSSH under a 15-year contract.

Meanwhile, place chicken in a skillet or saucepan and add enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer gently until cooked through and no longer pink in the middle, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board. When cool enough to handle, shred into bite-size strips.
Cook pasta in the boiling water until not quite tender, about 1 minute less than specified in the package directions. Add vegetables and cook until the pasta and vegetables are just tender, 1 minute more. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking liquid. Rinse the pasta and vegetables with cool water to refresh. Stir the reserved cooking liquid into the peanut sauce; add the pasta, vegetables and chicken; toss well to coat. Serve warm or chilled.
Make Ahead Tip: Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days. To serve, stir in 2 tablespoons warm water per portion; serve cold or reheat in microwave.
Ingredient Note: Chile-garlic sauce (or chili-garlic sauce, or paste) is a blend of ground chiles, garlic and vinegar and is commonly used to add heat and flavor to Asian soups, sauces and stir-fries.

This is only my second FCS Box, and I was excited to try their Winter scents, as well as try some new products. I was also tickled with their National Lampoon Christmas Vacation themed box. Really, who doesn’t love that movie? It’s a classic. At least in my family.
The FCS Box is $19.99 and quarterly, so it only happens 4 times a year. (This is how I justify keeping it around, because I’m pretty sure my monthly box bill is getting close to my monthly tuition bill. Ha. Just kidding. Tuition always wins…boo.)
Anyway, if you’re considering signing up for the next FCS box, which will be Spring, check out the kind of products you might find below! (And check out my Fall Box review here).
I’m surprised I’m not a member of a Jelly of the Month club with the way I’m obsessed with monthly subscriptions.
Already, I was digging this box more than Fall just because I liked the types of products included in the Winter box more.
Every box comes with a nice, colorful card that explains about each product and scent. It also has a $10 coupon on the back. I do love me a coupon.
“Moose Mug” Cuticle Butter- That is kind of a boring little black jar. Fortunately, I do like it’s contents. This has a nice Eggnog smell, (not as good as Haus of Gloi’s, but it still smells really tasty). It’s also seems to be moisturizing without being too greasy. I’ve been putting it on before bed and my terrifying cuticles are actually looking better.
“Mele Kelekimaka” OCD Hand Sanitizer- This smells like Malibu rum to me, (which makes me think about being 21. Malibu Rum is not your friend. Craft beer is your friend!), which it’s intended to, but I’m not sure how I feel about that in a hand sanitizer. This is my second FCS hand sanitizer, and I just feel like they aren’t scented that well in general. But hey- in my line of work, I will take all the hand sanitizer I can get.
“Jello Surprise” Whipped Cream-Festive Plum with a zesty curl of citrus, all wrapped up pretty-like with winter orchid and soft sandalwood. First, I can’t get over that name. Second, I actually really like the texture of FCS whipped creams. They are very lightweight and dry quickly, so I’m not smearing moisturizer on all my belongings for 30 minutes after using it.
My Jello Surprise Whipped Cream, was probably not the scent I would have picked out for myself, (Jelly of the Month sounds up my alley), but this scent has really grown on me. There’s something undeniably Christmas about it, but I can’t put my finger on what it is specifically. The plum? The sandalwood? I don’t know, but I will definitely be using this up!
“Christmas Bonus” Deep Conditioner- This seems like a really nice deep conditioner. I just recently chopped off like all my hair and don’t need to deep condition the few remaining strands, so I’m going to pass this along to someone who will love it. We’re supposed to take a guess on what the mystery scent is to win a giftcard. To me this smells like aged Fruit Roll ups that have been carefully dusted with birthday cake crumbs and the tears of a lady who is spending all her money on makeup…yeah, I don’t know.
“Fried Pussycat” Whipped Soap and “Sparky” Hydrate Me. I left it in the wrapper because it was oozing on things. I later learned I could stick it in the fridge to end this oozing.
“Fried Pussycat” Whipped Soap- I wanted to love this because Haus of Gloi has shown me there is nothing better in life than whipped soap. However, FCS is still tweaking their formula it seems like. I only got a jar that was about 1/4 full of soap. It smells nice and seems to lather nicely, but I was sad that there’s so little. I noticed on Facebook they are addressing this issue, so props to them for handling that.
I promise I did not stick my finger in the whipped soap. No for real, I am not being facetious for once!
“Sparky” Hydrate Me– This smell is described as “pumpkin waffles” on the info card, and they totally nailed it. This smells buttery, syrupy and delicious. I’m terrified to use it though. Apparently you are supposed to rub this on yourself after showering and it will “moisturize” you. (With my body, “moisturize” is actually a code word for “turn into an oil slick”). I might pass this on unless I work the nerve up to try it soon.
“I Pledge Allegiance, Amen!” Shower Steamer- Well, this is where my $10 coupon is going. It turns out, I love shower steamers! I placed this guy near the back of my shower, but close enough to get some steam, and as it dissolved it released a really strong, fresh, minty scent. I have bad allergies this time of year, so I appreciated the refreshing scent. I actually got 2 showers out of this steamer, too. (Because I forgot it was there and left it.) I definitely want to pick some of these up!
“Tis the Season to be Mary” Fortune Cookie Soap– I don’t get much of a smell from this, but I still think the shape and idea behind these are adorable. I haven’t used the one from my last box and I kinda don’t want to. Like, what do these look like when you actually use them as soap? Mushed fortune cookie? It’s too sad, I want to enjoy the pretty shape!
Overall, I had some clear favorites from this box: I really liked the Shower Steamer, Whipped Cream, and Cuticle Butter. I’m hoping I can score some Shower Steamers when they launch all the new products, and maybe something in a the “Sparky” scent. I do have a $10 coupon that’s burning a hole in my pocket.
I definitely think this was worth the quarterly $20, as I’ll be using most of these products throughout winter.
-What does a used Fortune Cookie Soap look like? I really want to know. Preferably, I’d like a visual. Thanks in advance.

Oh wow, thanks for clearing up the fortune cookie soap question for me! I’ve been hoarding the one from the fall box, but I might use it now because I’m curious! (Also it smelled so good.)

Fantastic service from the moment I contacted to enquire about a podiatry couch, to delivery from Spain and aftercare. Nothing was too much trouble. Will recommend Paul and his company to all fellow podiatrists. Even changed the Spanish plug over to UK plug and swapped a hand control to a foot control. Amazing . And the price was unbelievable for the product I bought and the service. Thank you so much .

In the last few years, the WWE 2K series has more or less bucked the iterative trend of the annual sports games it gets some of its DNA from by making risky but ultimately worthwhile changes to its formerly arcade-style formula.
By comparison WWE 2K17 feels like more of a fine-tuning year. There are some welcome gameplay tweaks and additions that keep the in-ring action in top form, but while it takes a few small steps forward in some ways it has either remained stationary or slid backward in areas that have needed improvement for a while now.
The first and most important thing, above and beyond the minutiae thats so easy to get caught up in with wrestling games, is whether the actual wrestling feels right. And like last years game, 2K17 delivers the goods. It has a weighty, deliberate feel that really sells the power and impact of each open-hand chop and every double-underhook suplex. Developers Yukes and Visual Concepts have steadily added layers of tactical depth in the last few years that reward timing, planning, and decision-making in a way that makes matches fun beyond the simple joy of playing as your favorite wrestler. All of that holds true this year; even more so thanks to a handful of adjustments and additions.
The single most significant improvement is to multi-person matches, which in the past have always been such an awkward mess that I usually avoided them altogether. This year, subtle changes to the default targeting system and a clever new mechanic has changed all of that for me. Manual targeting is now the default targeting method, and 2K17 does a better overall job of making your current target clear. Snappier target-switching helps too, allowing me to reverse an attack from one opponent and then quickly switch targets, whip around, and wail on someone behind me without feeling like I’m mired in mud.
WWE 2K17 doesnt make any big, drastic changes, but its smart gameplay tweaks have revitalized match types Id ignored the past few years. I really miss 2K Showcase, and 2K17 is still weak in areas that I feel should have been shored up by now, but its excellent combat, and generous amounts of customization help it retain its title.
The above is a select list of the improvements and additions we are making for WWE 2K17. There is a lot more to discuss in the near future, from the features above to online to all the other components we know you ll ask about, and we will get into more details as we get closer to the games release. We are excited to start sharing what we are doing with the game and look forward to letting everyone in on all the exciting things in store with WWE 2K17. After all, the Beast Incarnate, Brock Lesnar, is waiting for you in Suplex City.

The sponsor, Senator Mel Richardson of Idaho Falls, says a man’s home is his castle and he should be able to protect it.
The measure would allow someone to use force, including a weapon, against prowlers who enter their home — without the prowler being able to sue for injury-related civil damages.
There are some folks who would like us to believe that the Wild, Wild West now starts in the Sunshine State. According to the news media, when Governor Jeb Bush signed the “Castle Doctrine” into law last spring, with an effective date of October 1, 2005, Florida’s new moniker became the “Gun shine State.” The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence has perpetuated the nonsense and lies, warning tourists that Florida streets are not safe because citizens can take the law into their own hands…”
In 2006, Mississippi lawmakers will likely be debating the old common law notion that a “man’s home is his castle.”
Ex-convict Marcus Rawls, 23, of Jackson — whose criminal record includes convictions on drug charges, burglary and receiving stolen property charges — was killed by a single gunshot wound to the head in the pre-dawn hours Sunday.
After a 911 call, Jackson police found Rawls’ body on the porch of a home they believe he was trying to burglarize at the time he was shot by the homeowner, who fired a single shot through the door at about 2 a.m. The homeowner told police he was trying to scare the intruder away and didn’t know anyone had been hit until a few hours later.
He probably needed to borrow a cup of sugar, at 2 a.m., and was too embarassed to let them see his face.
The Main Stream Media has many techniques to transform the News into just about anything it wants it to be:
“…I put together a list of writing techniques I observed, and I assigned them names. My site was able to analyze news articles, reveal any hidden manipulations I detected, and post the source and analysis to the web in just minutes.
The site was pretty cool, but it had no impact whatsoever! The MSM was just too vast. A few years later there was the Blogosphere, sites like FR, Dan Rather was taken down, and my idea was superceded by reality.
Not long ago I took out my old analysis, dusted it off, and read over it. It was still rather interesting, at least to me. So I have posted the techniques I developed here, refreshing a couple of them with more recent information, so that others may have a look if they choose…”

My final job in Las Vegas, before I retired, was doing the lighting for the Jubilee Show at Bally’s.
This is Steve Connolly and I. Steve was the best Elvis that I ever worked. He is the winner of the “Best Elvis in Las Vegas” award. He had great backup singers and some excellent musicians.
During my final show, Steve stopped during his last song and gave a two-minute tribute to… me. I got a standing ovation from the audience.
Imagine you are there in the audience. The excitement is palpable. The houselights dim as the huge chandelier (think Phantom of the Opera), rises up to the ceiling so that it will be out of the way of the spotlight beams.
The overture, American Trilogy, starts quietly in the darkness. As it builds to a climax, I nervously lay on the stage waiting for my cue.
As the main curtain went up, I was laying on the stage with a CO2 fire extinguisher. The second curtain, (a gold lame’ as I recall), was hanging over my shoulders. When the drummer started pounding his drums like crazy, my cue was to spray the CO2 out toward the audience for a cheap fog effect.

“More frightening than Frankenstein. More destructive than alien invaders. They will numb your soul, steal your life, and threaten your most treasured relationships.
At the fall of mankind they were unleashed on the world, wreaking havoc and sending thousands fleeing from their homes. And their lair is found in the last place anyone wants to look – the mysterious depths of their own hearts!
But be encouraged, these monsters have a weakness. They can be defeated. You can escape their clutches and be free of their influence.

“The impending execution of Abdul Rahman for embracing Christianity is, of course, offensive to Westerners, and so around the world we reacted equally violently by issuing blood-curdling threats like that made by State Department spokesman Sean McCormack: ‘Freedom of worship is an important element of any democracy,’ he said. ‘And these are issues as Afghan democracy matures that they are going to have to deal with increasingly.’
You cannot ask Americans or Britons to expend blood and treasure to build a society in which a man can be executed for his choice of religion.

The vote was 91-33, giving supporters seven votes more than the required two-thirds majority. The Senate voted 30-10 for the override Wednesday night, three votes more than needed.
Content Warning: When I Googled for Kathleen Sebelius, I found this webpage about Dr. Tiller, one of her supporters.
In 1995, Bev Courtwright, a Willard Psychiatric Center employee, was tasked by the New York State Office of Mental Health to inspect the now-closed psychiatric center to determine whether there are still things worth salvaging.
Courtwright discovered a museum-worthy collection of over 400 old suitcases. The suitcases, which contained the belongings of former patients, have been there sometime between 1910 and 1960 when their owners were admitted to Willard.
The cases are now under the care of the New York State Museum. A small number of the them have been displayed in the museum and photographer Jon Crispin give us a peek of their contents.
"Maude had 3 cases. The wicker case and the "4 winners" box were empty. But the suitcase contained her tools for working with leather."
"These objects open a small window into the lives of some of the people who lived at the facility, and I am determined to share them with as many people as possible."
"This was another fairly early case which I shot in February of 2011. It has a rather odd collection of items, but I loved the coin purse with the keys. In the last shot you can see how the New York State museum staff individually wrapped each of the two keys. Such a great amount of care was used in preserving the cases and their contents."
"Anna had three separate wrapped items. The two cases were similar, but the radio was a complete surprise to me. She clearly liked to do needlework, and as can be seen in the books and papers, she was learning English and the Pledge of Allegiance."
"Dmytre lived at Willard for most of his adult life. He was a prolific artist, and his paintings were hung in various buildings at the institution."
"Mary R came from Eastern Europe and had an interesting collection of clippings as well as some fine needlework.
"Helen's suitcase is one of the few that was wrapped in this kind of heavy paper. She was admitted to Willard on 19 January 1968."
"Steffan's case presented an interesting dilemma for me as I was immediately attracted to the clock but then began to feel guilty that I was more interested in the object than in the case itself and in Steffan's life. It was good to sort this feeling out in a relatively early part of the process. But I still love this clock."
For years I have heard how learning history prepares students for a variety of jobs and tasks that require critical thinking, creativity, and an organized mind, and it is true! Learning the methods of historians does prepare people to become curators of information, critical thinkers, and excellent presenters. Yet, why do students believe history is the rote memorization of dates and facts, and instructors teach history as such? Unfortunately, teaching the dates and facts is simpler and easier to assess, whereas preparing on how to do history takes time, energy, and a comfort with flexibility. One way to promote the skills of an historian is teaching history as a process, not as a final result. History is not final, as any trained historian knows. The people who grow to love history generally do because of its messiness. Multiple perspectives, access to and quality of primary sources, and causation make history confusing and fascinating. One way to make history more engaging and productive is to teach the historian’s process.
Research method is more important than the final product. Teaching students how to conduct and present research is extremely important and arguably the most valuable skill historians possess. Yet, most history projects focus too much on the final product, something abstract to a young mind. If an instructor expects their students to write a 5, 8, 10, 25 page paper by the end of the course, and the students have never done so, how can the students expect to create a final product they are unfamiliar with? Teaching to the process allows instructors to find the weaknesses of their students earlier, thereby allowing mistakes to be corrected long before the final product is due.
Students have more chances to make mistakes and learn from them. Teachers will have more opportunities to catch the small blunders that together result into lackluster final products. Most human beings will fix what they know is wrong, it is our nature. If students know they are being assessed on their ability to fix their mistakes, then they will invest more time into learning what those mistakes are and how to correct them. Focusing on the process allows teachers to see mistakes early. Detecting mistakes in the beginning is crucial for large scale projects, which do not allow people to go back and dismantle large sections because of an early mistake.
Projects are difficult and represent life. Whether individual or group, projects present a multitude of problems that both students and instructors would rather avoid. Despite their difficulty, projects are the best way teachers can demonstrate how life works. Outside of the school walls, life is a collection of major projects. Students need to learn how to collaborate with others, organize themselves over the course of a series of deadlines, and enjoy the process of critical thinking.
The amount of assessment and critical evaluation goes up, and outside classroom evaluation goes down. I have heard several teachers state that they spent 5 to 10 hours grading papers or assignments over a weeknight or weekend. Getting into education is a sacrifice, but grading for several hours after work is ridiculous. Worse yet, most of the students will not spend time improving their next project on the assessment given. Students become overloaded and confused if they have too many corrections to make. Furthermore, they will not improve an assignment that no longer has meaning. Focusing on the process allows the teacher several more opportunities to make informal evaluations that can have positive effects over the entire project. If students understand an instructor will be looking for a certain mistake, then they will try not to repeat it.
When teaching to the process, assessments will become organic, informal, something more like real life. For example, when my boss notes that I have made a mistake, they do not wait on my monthly teaching report to tell me. They will generally tell me in passing or when we are casually talking. I go back to my classroom and do my best to fix my mistake. If I did not fix the mistake, that alludes to a serious problem that I do not understand. Student assessment should be similar and curriculum should be flexibly delivered to best benefit the individual student.
Peer assessment is easier to implement when instructors focus on the process. Peer assessment is an excellent tool to both teach students how to be critical of each other and to save teacher time. In a future Peer Assessment article, I will write about the benefits and ways to implement peer assessment. For this section's purpose, just know that peer assessment gives more opportunities for students to receive critical evaluation faster and obtain multiple points-of-view.
An important comment to make is that teaching to the process leads to better final products. One of the most crucial methods I implement to help students grow is I tell them from the beginning of the school year, “your next project will be better than your last. In fact, it is part of your grade.” I grade improvement on how well they analyzed a primary source to how many words they have in their essay. Students learn how to think critically, how to dig deeper, and how to really flesh out an idea. Do all of my students write brilliant essays? No. But, the student who could not write a paragraph can write a two-page paper by the end of the school year. The student who could write a 600 word five paragraph essay, can now write eight pages with complete Chicago style citations (and get qualified to go to nationals for National History Day). My students all came into my room at a certain level and grow to the next one. I ensure that because I focus on their process of how they learn and create.
History Forge provides resources to teachers, students, and interested individuals who wish to research and create historical projects. The focus is to not teach specific historical content, but teach how to analyze information in order to create presentable projects. Please explore section on research, primary source learning, or project ideas.

The Four Level Interchange of Arroyo Seco Parkway and Highway 101, looking northeast, in Los Angeles, California. It was the first stacked interchange in the world.
A stack interchange, or colloquially butterfly junction, is a particular, free-flowing type of designs for interchanges, meaning grade-separated road junctions. It is referred to as a directional interchange in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.[1]
In countries where one drives on the right, left turns are handled by semi-directional flyovers or under ramps. Vehicles first exit the main carriageway to the right, then complete the turn via a ramp that crosses both highways, eventually merging with the traffic turning right from the opposite side of the interchange. A stack interchange therefore has two pairs of left-turning ramps, which may be "stacked" in various configurations above or below the two interchanging highways. In countries where one drives on the left, the appearance of the junction is topologically identical, but traffic flows are reversed.
Stacks eliminate the problems of weaving and have the highest vehicle capacity among different types of four-way interchanges. However, they require considerable and expensive construction work for their flyover ramps, as well as having a larger footprint. Stack interchanges are also widely considered to be an eyesore among residents of homes near existing or proposed interchanges, leading to considerable NIMBY opposition.
The four-level stack (or simply four-stack) has one major road crossing another on a bridge, with connector roads crossing on two further levels. This type of interchange does not usually permit U-turns. The four-level stack creates two "inverse" dual-carriageways—the turn ramps crossing the middle section have traffic driving on the opposite side of oncoming traffic to usual (see diagram for clarity).
In the United Kingdom there are three four-level stacks: at the junction of the M4 and M25 near Heathrow Airport in London, at the junction of the M23 and M25 to the south of London, and at the junction of the M4 and M5 near Bristol (the Almondsbury Interchange). The M4/M25 junction is particularly unusual as it also has a railway line bisecting it at its lowest level. The M4/M25 junction is slightly offset so there is no point where all four levels are directly above each other. M25 (a north–south road at this junction) is offset to the east by approximately 60 metres (200 ft). The junction of the A19 and A66 in Teesside uses a three-level variant, with a 270-degree loop allowing southbound A19 traffic to exit to the westbound A66.
In the Netherlands there is currently one four-level stack interchange: the Prins Clausplein near The Hague. It forms the junction of the A4 and A12.
Highway Interchange between Dolphin Expressway and Palmetto Expressway (Dolphin–Palmetto Interchange) in Greater Miami, Florida, United States
The first stack interchange was the Four Level Interchange (renamed the Bill Keene Memorial Interchange), built in Los Angeles, California, and completed in 1949, at the junction of US Route 101 (US 101)and State Route 110 (SR 110).[2] Since then, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has built eight more four-level stacks throughout the state of California, as well as a larger number of three-level stack/cloverleaf hybrids (where the least-used left-turning ramp is built as a cloverleaf-like 270-degree loop).
The partially used stack interchange over I‑84. CT‑9 traffic can be seen using the flyover to access westbound I‑84.
The first four-level stack interchange in Texas was built in Fort Worth at the intersection of Interstate 35W (I-35W) and I-30 (originally I-20) near downtown. This interchange, finished in 1958, was known as "The Pretzel" or the "Mixmaster" by locals. The original contract cost was $1,220,000.[3] Improvements to the old Mixmaster over the past 60 years include an upgrade to a Texas-style five-level stack exchange (see below).
One of the first four-level stack interchanges in the northeastern United States was constructed in the late 1960s over I-84 in Farmington, Connecticut, for the controversial I-291 beltway around the city of Hartford. Most of the I‑291 beltway was later cancelled, and the sprawling stack lay dormant for almost 25 years. In 1992 the extension of Connecticut Route 9 to I-84 used the I‑291 right-of-way and some sections of the abandoned interchange. Several ramps still remain unused, including abandoned roadbed for I-291 both north and south of the complex.
Another well-known stack interchange lies west of Baltimore, Maryland, serving as the junction between I-695 and I-70. It was originally built for a planned extension of I‑70 into the city, but because of heavy opposition, I‑70 ends at a park and ride 3 miles (4.8 km) east. As a result, the road east of I‑695 sees very little traffic compared to the high volumes to and from the west.
Another four-level stack interchange in the Baltimore area is located at the northeastern junction between I-695 and I-95. The stack was built as part of a massive I-95 reconstruction project that includes high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes), designed to relieve congestion between Baltimore and its northeastern suburbs.
In Lone Tree, Colorado, there is a four-level stack serving I-25, the eastern end of C-470 and the southern end of E-470. In Thornton, Colorado, there is another stack serving I-25 and E-470 at its northern end as it continues west as the Northwest Parkway.
Although it planned to build many four-level stack interchanges, Canada has only one true four-level stack interchange, between Highway 400 and Highway 407 in Ontario. Planned four-level stacks at Highway 407 and Highway 410, and Highway 407 and Highway 404 were reduced to three-level interchanges, with loop ramps instead of a fourth level of ramps. The interchange between Highway 401, Highway 403, and Highway 410 is almost a full four-level stack, with a loop ramp planned to be added in the northeast quadrant which would make it a four-way interchange.[4][5]
The Light Horse Interchange at the junction of the M4 and M7 is a four-level stack interchange in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Opened in late 2005, it is the largest in the Southern Hemisphere.
The EB Cloete Interchange just outside Durban, South Africa, is another four-level stack interchange. The N3 is the busiest highway in South Africa and a very busy truck route. Because Johannesburg is not located near a body of water, most of the city's exports travel through the Port of Durban. The N2 connects Cape Town with Durban and serves the South African cities of Port Elizabeth, Plettenberg Bay, and Margate, and the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. Two busy roads intersect at the junction. A four-level stack interchange was chosen to serve the high volumes of traffic.
In Texas, many stacks contain five levels. They usually have the same configuration as four-level stacks, but frontage roads add a fifth level. The frontage roads usually intersect with traffic lights and are similar to a grid of nearby one-way streets. A common setup is for one mainline to go below grade and another to go above grade. The intersection of the frontage roads is typically at grade or close to it. Two pairs of left-turn connectors are built above these.
The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex has several five-level stacks, most notably the High Five Interchange between US 75 and I-635; completed in 2005 and currently the tallest interchange in the world.[6] Others can be found at the interchanges between State Highway 121 (SH 121) and the Dallas North Tollway, SH 121 and I-35E/US 77, I-30 and I-35W, I-30 and President George Bush Turnpike and others which are technically five levels but do not fit under a Texas-style stack configuration (i.e. the extra level being located away from the central stack or existing in only one direction).
The Houston area has seven five-level stack interchanges along Beltway 8: at I-10 east and west of downtown, I-69 northeast and southwest of downtown, I-45 north and south of downtown, and US 290 in the beltway's northwest quadrant.[7] The newly reconstructed interchange of I-610 and I-69, with the new I‑610 northbound feeder road built underground and the new I-610 southbound feeder road overpass, is also a five-level stack interchange.[8]
Though not a Texas-style stack in the above sense, an unusual stack is nonetheless found in Houston that features more than four levels of traffic but whose fifth level exists in only one direction. In 2011, the previously four-level stack interchange between I-610 and I-10 on the city's east side gained a new (though long-planned)[9] level of complexity with the opening of four ramps connecting the new US 90 (Crosby Freeway) to the east, featuring direct movements for the new freeway to and from the southeast quadrant of I-610, to westbound I-10, and from eastbound I-10. It is the latter ramp which gives the interchange the fifth level, as US 90 to I-10 westbound merges onto I-10 before crossing I-610. (None of the frontage roads for these highways cross the interchange itself, and thus do not factor into the complexity of the stack.)[10]
More than 40 bridges make up the five-level stack interchange known as the Big I between I-40 and I-25 in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
China is also home to many Texas-style stack interchanges. For example the Nanjing's Yingtian Street Elevated has one each where it intersects the Inner Ring Road twice.
Sometimes a fifth level is added for HOV connectors. An example of this exists in Los Angeles, California, at the Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange. The connector from HOV southbound 110 to HOV westbound 105 can be at the same level as the connector from mixed eastbound 105 to mixed northbound 110, but the connector from HOV southbound 110 to HOV eastbound 105 needs to be higher level, since it crosses over the former connector.
Another case is where connection to nearby arterials suggests that another level may be useful, thus making the interchange more complicated but easier to use. In the Atlanta area, a side ramp forms the fifth level of the Tom Moreland Interchange, colloquially known as Spaghetti Junction, found in DeKalb County, Georgia.
Yan'an East Road Interchange, a six-level urban stack interchange in Puxi, Shanghai, China (Nanbei Elevated Road and Yan'an Elevated Road)
There is a six-level stack on the Yan'an East Road Interchange (Chinese: 延安东路立交) in Puxi, Shanghai, with no dedicated HOV/bus/truck lanes. It is six-level stack because it is formed by two elevated highways, Nanbei Elevated Road and Yan'an Elevated Road with service roads and a footbridge underneath. The centrally located interchange has a central pillar known as the Nine-Dragon Pillar (Chinese: 九龙柱). The story is that after several construction accidents, a monk suggested the nine-dragon be welcomed with a bas relief sculpture depicting the dragon.[citation needed]
An unusual six-level stack is located at the junction between Interstate 35E and I-635 in Dallas, Texas, and does not contain any service or frontage roads. The interchange features two levels of highway with the top three levels consisting of direct connection ramps and HOV connectors. A single ramp leading from I-635 westbound to I-35E southbound weaves underneath the I-635 eastbound bridge, making the interchange six levels.[11]
The interchange between I-35E and the Sam Rayburn Tollway in Lewisville, Texas, although similar in design to five-level stacks elsewhere in Texas, also qualifies as a six-level stack, since the ramp connecting the eastbound Sam Rayburn Tollway with northbound I-35E goes over the fifth-level ramps connecting I-35E in both directions with the Sam Rayburn Tollway. The ramp connecting the westbound Sam Rayburn Tollway with southbound I-35E is on the fourth level of the interchange, going under the fifth-level ramps connecting both directions of I-35E with the Sam Rayburn Tollway[12].

U.S. unions have developed the instrument of strategic campaigns to overcome growing employer resistance and political hostility towards union organizing and bargaining.

Many unions have stepped up their efforts regarding cross-border cooperation, but serious impediments to effective transnational union activity remain.

After having long sufficient discussions between us, we've come to realize that the option of going our separate ways would be the best for each other's future.
It was hard to make our own time as a family since we long spent each other's time separately in Tokyo and Osaka, but the time we spent together until now is irreplaceable and we are grateful for each other.

Gori got severely injured in the game on Feb 18 and was forced to break away from the team for a long term (they say it requires 12 months for recovery).
oh wow, that's quite bad.. Poor Gori. I hope he recovers fully... :/ 2018 isn't starting off very well for him sadly.
Just as a note I am using LiquidCrystal_I2C V2.0, and the back light is connected from PCF8574 "P7" as per Pighixxx ABC Guide but with a 3904 transitor.
the back light was doing the opposite of the Code. I assume the backlight timeout is to save the battery if used.

I notice that on breadboard the capacitance tests are not that great, and even with no cap in place you still get significant reading.I realize this probably to do with the capacitance of leads/connections.
I'm writing a cross-platform software that once you connected to Ardutest provide additional information about tested components.
A nice thing, which I think no one has ever implemented, it's the acquisition of data and access to a database of components.
This is an alpha version, only makes the transistor search. The final version will provide a lots of information of the transistor.

Gothabilly is one of several music and cultural subgenres of rockabilly. The earliest known use of the word gothabilly was by The Cramps in the late 1970s, to describe their blend of somber, rockabilly-influenced punk rock. Since then the term has come to describe a fashion and music trend that bridges both the gothic and rockabilly subcultures.
Gothabilly is particularly active in the western portion of the United States, with many of today's bands originating in California.
Gothabilly is a musical subgenre that developed from mixing the gothic subculture with rockabilly music. Gothabilly retains the country music and blues influences of rockabilly but adds aspects of punk rock and gothic rock to create a distinct combination of styles. The gothabilly sound was defined in the mid 1980s embodied by a slower tempo and melancholy ambience with romantic, literary, occult and religious themes. More recent adopters had brought a faster pace and horror themes often with a humorous or comic attitude with deliberately cheesy themes, such as camp 1960s monster movies and the television shows like The Addams Familyand The Munsters.
Gothabilly is frequently viewed as a sub-sect of the psychobilly subgenre, as both use the upright double bass and simple rhythms of rockabilly chord progressions and incorporating punk influences. However, gothabilly differs from psychobilly in that gothabilly lacks much of psychobilly's aggression and incorporates aspects of gothic music such as jangly guitars drowned in reverb, rolling jungle drums, organs, and tends to be slower and more atmosphere-oriented. While both incorporate monsters, ghosts and other horror imagery and themes, gothabilly adds aspects of the romantic and paranormal.
Gothabilly style is a tongue-in-cheek play on 1950s-inspired kitsch aesthetics of the rockabilly subculture, but with a dark gothic influence, blending retro rock and roll fashions with the somber features of goth.
The gothabilly wardrobe incorporates some style elements from the retro culture revival, including: stylized flames, 50's tattoo imagery, animal prints, creeper shoes, cherry accessories and ubiquitous polka dot clothes, pencil skirts, fishnet stockings and high heels, all popular in both the rockabilly and psychobilly scenes.The goth influence can be seen in the softer textures of black silks, satins, lace and velvet, corsets, top hats, antique jewelry, PVC, and leather.
The term gothabilly is used not only to describe a musical genre but a fashion and a lifestyle as well. Gothabilly and psychobilly both enjoy the sound of the double bass and share interests in B-rated horror movies, kitsch, hot rods (especially hearses, see www.hearseclub.com for example!), vintage fashion, the macabre and all things noir.

My lesson for the week: when the curried tomato coconut soup explodes all over the kitchen at 10:30 p.m. on Sunday night, it’s time to admit there’s no way you’re also making bulgur pilaf for a Monday night dinner gathering.
Here’s one of the things I don’t understand about myself: why does it take exploding soup to get me to realize this? Simple addition would do the trick. Number of hours between present time and guest arrival: 20.5. Hours that should be spent sleeping, working, or getting to and from work: 19. Time it takes to make bulgur pilaf: too much. After all, there is now a big mess of soup to clean up.
Earlier that very day my mom and I had discussed the radical concept of accepting our limitations. We spend a lot of time in this culture pretending we can overcome any shortcoming with hard work and will power, but that’s just silly.
I am never going to be an Olympic high jumper, for example, or win the Nobel Prize in Physics. I’ve pretty much gotten over both of those. For some reason, it’s harder to accept that I’m never going to approach Martha Stewart-ish, even though I don’t actually want to make matching, spring green, baby-duck napkins, placemats, and table runners out of recycled aprons for Easter brunch.
Other difficult ones: I will never be the uber-productive, uber-efficient, uber-thrifty member of any randomly selected sample of American women aged 27-45. Or any other age for that matter. I will almost never get anything much done after 9 p.m., except this blog. I will probably never succeed at any diet that includes less than a lot of chocolate. I feel I ought to be able to make myself have these capabilities, but I don’t.
It’s possible I’ll once again be cleaning soup off the butter, the counter, the floor, the cookbook, the real estate papers before remembering any of this. At that point, I hope I also remember to laugh and order pizza.
AMEN! So much to learn while we are here, so why do we need so many lessons about the SAME things. If we accepted ourselves just the way we are what TIME we could save to do FUN things! Thanks for your honesty and clarity, Rachel.
I'm an author looking for an agent and/or publisher for my debut novel about recovering from the death of a child. I blog about whatever helps when life—whether of the real or fictional variety—gets difficult. Top contenders for me include community, God, chocolate, and laughter. Laughs can be found in the Coleslaw section.

The majority of the church fathers are of the opinion that more people, indeed more people claiming to be Christian, will be damned than saved. There is a minority who hold an opposing opinion. As overly-optimistic visions of Hell are not particularly helpful, so too are hellfire speeches which luridly describe the punishments of Hell are not useful. Prayer, however, is never wasted.

sundays are good days to take a break, think about the great stuff you did on friday and saturday and calm down, get ready for a new work week. on sundays you might make a spectacular dinner, like a roast or a vegetable soup, you eat long breakfasts and drink lots of tea, spend an extra hour in bed just because the book you’re reading is so good. you have some candy and watch films. lots of films. for me, the perfect sunday motion picture is the wonderful the big sleep with lauren bacall and humphrey bogart. it’s so so funny and great. don’t be frightened by the lack of color. the color is in the dialogue, the body language, in lauren bacall’s deep dark voice. and in the fact that it was during doing this film that lauren bacall and humphrey bogart fell in love with eachother, and you can actually see it in their eyes when they look at eachother. just take a look.

Smoking is dangerous to your health, and vaping can be a less dangerous solution. Although, not in Thailand. In Thailand, import, possession and sale of e-cigarettes and e-liquids are strictly prohibited; thus bringing your electronic cigarette to Thailand may not be a good idea.
If caught in the customs, they will confiscate the e-cigarette and e-liquid, and you get a fine. You even risk arrest and jail time, as the punishment is up to five years in prison for users and up to 10 years in prison for dealers. A Thai prison is not a place you want to spend your time; it will be an experience you remember for the rest of your life.
It is not only in the customs there is a risk of being caught. If you make it through the customs, the police may arrest you if they see you vaping on the street or at your hotel. Please be aware, that it is not vaping as such that is illegal, it is the possession of e-cigarettes and e-liquids. If a police officer sees an e-cigarette in your shirt pocket, he may arrest you.
The solution is to resort to nicotine patches, smoke real cigarettes, or take a "cold turkey" on your vacation.
As with so many other laws and regulations in Thailand, the customs officials and the police only do something if they care. Just as you can see the police ignoring people driving a scooter without a helmet, they may ignore you vaping. Nonetheless, sometimes they actually do care about making people obey the laws. If you take the chance and bring your e-cigarette and e-liquid to Thailand, it would probably be a good idea to limit vaping to your hotel room.
According to the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, several tourists have been arrested for possession of vaporisers and e-cigarettes in Thailand.

Read more about the joiner fee and how to avoid paying extra for bringing a guest to your hotel.
It is not a problem to bring common medications to Thailand. However, if you use strong painkillers, drugs containing narcotics, or drugs that affect the central nervous system, you will probably need a certificate from your doctor.
The prescription rules are not as strict in Thailand as in many other countries. Even if you need a prescription for the drug in your country, you may be able to buy the drug over the counter in Thailand. Read more about buying medications in Thailand.
Take care of your passport, and be careful what you sign. As a foreigner, the law requires you to bring your passport always when you are in Thailand. Also, you should never sign papers you do not understand, even if the police tell you to sign them.

Phuket is Thailand's largest island and the preferred holiday destination for most foreign tourists. Phuket is the perfect holiday destination, whether you want to laze on the beach or you want a more active holiday sightseeing, jungle trekking, ziplining, riding an elephant, and much more.
Until 1767, Ayutthaya was the capital of Siam (Thailand). At one time, it was the world's largest city. Ayutthaya was conquered and deserted some 250 years ago; after almost 200 years of decay, Thailand started a restoration project. Today, the ruins of Ayutthaya is a popular attraction for tourists and Thais alike.
Pon Beach is also known as Nai Yair Beach. The road to Pon Beach is blocked by a hotel, which will only let guests get access to the beach. Thus, to visit the beach, you have two options, you can stay at The Naka Phu­ket Villa, where the prices start at about 20,000 baht (20000 baht) per night for a villa, or you can arrive at the beach by sea.
I had to settle for a photo from a distance because I did not have the time to sail to the beach and my plastic card is not suitable for a stay at the hotel. The photo is a few years old, from back when they had not yet finished building the hotel. The hotel looks very different now, as you can see if you follow the link to the hotel.
The beach is very pretty, although an older description of the beach mentions shingles, which makes the beach less suitable for swimming. However, there should be a great opportunity for snorkelling at a coral reef 100 meters from the shore. Judging from the photos of the finished hotel, I guess the guests do not miss a great beach.
I have not yet written about all of the beaches; thus, there are many inactive links on the list. Please be patient, I will get to them. The list is in geographical order, starting at the north side of Phuket, then down the west side and finally up the east side.
In Thailand, you do not shake hands when saying hello or goodbye, you use a wai. Read more about the wai, and why you only have to wai if you are Thai.
Computerized decision support system as an AMS tool: There is still, a long way to go | Open Virtual Learning Community
Computerized decision support systems (CDSS) integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) seem like an excellent idea for antibiotic stewardship: they are available around the clock, can easily integrate relevant clinical information and can much easier intervene before a prescription is made than antibiotic stewards. Yet almost 20 years after the publication of the landmark paper by Evans et al. in the New England Journal of Medicine describing marked increases in the appropriateness of antibiotic use associated with the implementation of a CDSS in an ICU in Salt Lake City, CDSS are far from universal even in countries with widespread availability of EHRs.(1) In addition, there have been relatively few studies since 1998 describing successful implementation of antibiotic CDSS and some studies have had outright disappointing results.
In an article jut published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents Chow and colleagues describe the implementation of an antibiotic CDSS integrated into the EHR in a 1500 bed tertiary care center in Singapore. The system recommends guideline concordant treatment based on data entered by the physician (eg the indication) and data retrieved from the EHR and provides guidance on renal adaption of antimicrobials (The exact functionalities of the system are difficult to understand based on the article – eg in how far is the patient’s microbiologic data taken into account?). The CDSS had to be used for prescription of certain restricted drugs (notably piperacillin / tazobactam) and carbapenems but could be used for any antibiotic prescription. In the article the authors aim to describe their experience with the implementation of the system, describe factors associated with the “voluntary” and “involuntary” use of the system and factors associated with the acceptance of the recommendation. The also describe the results of two focus groups with prescribers about the perceived utility of the system.
The first somewhat sobering finding is that physicians often did not complete the entire CDSS procedure and that higher completion rates where only achieved once aborting became practically impossible. Only 40% of suggestions for restricted antibiotics were accepted (as to be expected the percentage was better at 89% for voluntary use of the system). In a multivariate analysis being a prescriber from internal medicine (OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.04-1.37) and using the system outside the normal working hours (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.21-1.61) was associated with higher acceptance of the recommendations. The focus groups showed the older physicians were more skeptical about the system.
What to make of all this? First, reports like this are urgently needed so that other hospitals can learn from them. The hospital should also be congratulated for developing and implementing such a system integrated into EHR and seemingly easy to use. Yet, the study also confirms how difficult it is to implement CDSS and that prescribers nearly have to be “forced” to use it. The resistance to CDSS may partly be a generational issue as shown by the focus group results. Based on my own experience there definitely is a generational gap in the use of technology in the hospital… even when it comes to simple things like using an electronic instead of a paper-based agenda. Unfortunately the study does not report data on appropriateness of use and patient outcomes (adverse drug reactions, mortality, length of stay, resistance, costs), these would be very welcome and useful.
Overall, I am confident that CDSS for antibiotic stewardship will eventually be standard, but we may have to wait another 20 years…
Usually I do&2n8#17;t read post on blogs, however I would like to say that this write-up very pressured me to try and do it! Your writing style has been amazed me. Thank you, very great article.
I was fortunate enough to lock in a seat at Caleb and Kat's airbrushing class over the weekend, in Seattle Washington- a father's day present from my wife.
Let me tell you, the class was worth the 200 bucks. In fact, the level of teaching, and catering, I received as a student was far more valuable then the price of admission. I learned so much about my airbrush, about color theory and dynamism when painting minis. Both Caleb and Kat were very patient and giving over the two days- I can't speak highly enough about this class.
I think it is a must take class, for novice to experienced AB painter, and I strongly suggest readers to seek out Caleb and Kat and sign up for a class. The financial investment is a pittance when compared to the training, you will receive, and the friendships that will be forged.
The Independent Characters took the class and covered it in their podcast (along with a nice interview with Caleb and Kat).
If you are curious about airbrushing minis, or, want to improve your airbrush experience I can't recommend CK Studios enough.
I will be adding to this post as I add pictures of the different Kingdom Death Monster cards in card sleeves.
First up are gear cards. Each card is around 50-51mm square. I tried two different offerings, and, opted with Mage 53x53 premium sleeves (pictured below):
Kingdom Death: Monster is a cooperative board game set in a horrific land where players fight and die together to protect and nurture their fragile settlement from sinister monsters hungry for human flesh and soul...
So approximately 4 weeks ago, this gorgeous army was auctioned on Ebay by AA-Games located in the UK. The Ebay seller could not provide me any information as to who this amazing army previously belonged to. Although I managed to win one of the guardian lots, sadly, I did not receive the auction.
I am posting screen caps of the original auctions in the hopes that a reader may recognize this army. I would love the opportunity to pick the brain of the person responsible for painting these models as I want to apply this same paint scheme to my SM army and
Our four newest survivors took to the hunt at the beginning of Lantern Year 11, tracking a White Lion. Three of the four warriors lived to return home, the fourth was an unfortunate victim to the monster's playful batting; the monster literally blowing up her head in a visceral explosion!
One beautiful page found in the Kingdom Death: Monster rulebook. The amount of page turning required for the game leaves me feeling dirty after every play session. This book should be a centerpiece on any coffee table, rather than manhandled every game session.
Up until this nemesis encounter, I felt like I had a grasp on the game's difficulty. This battle was a definite DPS check that I failed miserably. I won't spoil the encounter other than to say that he fully wiped my party with only one wound caused by our team.
I have got to say, Adam Poots is such a class act. I purchased a copy of Kingdom Death: Monster. Quite a little investment for a board game, but, when you take into account the figures, the mechanics, and the replay value- well worth the price. I bought it directly through Adam's site, Kingdom Death during the last pre-order wave he opened up.

In a previous article, I showed two ways to define a log-likelihood function in SAS. This article shows two ways to compute maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) in SAS: the nonlinear optimization subroutines in SAS/IML and the NLMIXED procedure in SAS/STAT. To illustrate these methods, I will use the same data sets from my previous post. One data set contains binomial data, the other contains data that are lognormally distributed. You can download the SAS program that creates the data and computes these maximum likelihood estimates.
I previously wrote a step-by-step description of how to compute maximum likelihood estimates in SAS/IML. SAS/IML contains many algorithms for nonlinear optimization, including the NLPNRA subroutine, which implements the Newton-Raphson method.
The NLPNRA subroutine computes that the maximum of the log-likelihood function occurs for p=0.56, which agrees with the graph in the previous article. We conclude that the parameter p=0.56 (with NTrials=10) is "most likely" to be the binomial distribution parameter that generated the data.
If you've never used PROC NLMIXED before, you might wonder why I am using that procedure, since this problem is not a mixed modeling regression. However, you can use the NLMIXED procedure for general maximum likelihood estimation. In fact, I sometimes joke that SAS could have named the procedure "PROC MLE" because it is so useful for solving maximum likelihood problems.
PROC NLMIXED has built-in support for computing maximum likelihood estimates of data that follow the Bernoulli (binary), binomial, Poisson, negative binomial, normal, and gamma distributions. (You can also use PROC GENMOD to fit these distributions; I have shown an example of fitting Poisson data.)
Notice that the output from PROC NLMIXED contains the parameter estimate, standard error, and 95% confidence intervals. The parameter estimate is the same value (0.56) as was found by the NLPNRA routine in SAS/IML. The confidence interval confirms what we previously saw in the graph of the log-likelihood function: the function is somewhat flat near the optimum, so a 95% confidence interval is wide: [0.49, 0.63].
By the way, both PROC IML and PROC NLMIXED enable you to choose your favorite optimization solver. In this example, I used Newton-Raphson (CALL NLPNRA) for the SAS/IML solver, but you could also use a quasi-Newton solver (the NLPQN subroutine), which is the solver used by PROC NLMIXED. Or you can tell PROC NLMIXED to use Newton-Raphson by adding TECHNIQUE=NEWRAP to the PROC NLMIXED statement.
PROC NLMIXED does not support the lognormal distribution as a built-in distribution, which means that you need to explicitly write out the log-likelihood function and specify it in the GENERAL function on the MODEL statement. Whereas in SAS/IML you have to use the SUM function to sum the log-likelihood over all observations, the syntax for PROC NLMIXED is simpler. Just as the DATA step has an implicit loop over all observations, the NLMIXED procedure implicitly sums the log-likelihood over all observations. You can use the LOGPDF function, or you can explicitly write the log-density formula for each observation.
If you look up the lognormal distribution in the list of "Standard Definition" in the PROC MCMC documentation, you will see that one parameterization of the lognormal PDF in terms of the log-mean μ and log-standard-deviation σ is
When you take the logarithm of this quantity, you get two terms, or three if you use the rules of logarithms to isolate quantities that do not depend on the parameters:
In conclusion, you can use nonlinear optimization in the SAS/IML language to compute MLEs. This approach is especially useful when the computation is part of a larger computational program in SAS/IML. Alternatively, the NLMIXED procedure makes it easy to compute MLEs for discrete and continuous distributions. For some simple distributions, the log-likelihood functions are built into PROC NLMIXED. For others, you can specify the log likelihood yourself and find the maximum likelihood estimates by using the GENERAL function.

Rick, you say /* Before running program, create Binomial and LN data sets from previous post */, yet when I follow the link to the previous post all I find is the Fisher Iris data!
Sorry for the confusion. The link that contains the data came later. I added a new link earlier to make it easier to find the data. Search for the word "download" on this page.
How would you interpret a MLE for a NL transformed lognormal variable. It would be on the log normal scale, so is it interpreted as a percentage, just a log version, or can you back transform it into a log normal value?
Sorry, but I don't understand what you mean by "interpret." The parameters that optimize the ML are those which are most likely, given the data. If the "NL transformation" is monotonic, the same parameters maximize the likelihood of the r.v AND the transformed r.v. If that doesn't help, you can ask your question on a discussion forum. Since your question does not involve SAS programming, I suggest https://math.stackexchange.com
As the Research Triangle Park becomes more popular, we're getting a lot more traffic on the roads. And with flexible work hours, of course I try to pick a time to drive to work when there's less traffic. I recently saw a cool infographic showing the most popular times when people commute to work ... but I was skeptical about their data, and decided to put it to the SAS test!
Here's their original infographic. At first glance, it's cute and seems to be a straightforward presentation of the data. The bars look like roads (which is acceptable and clever, in my opinion).But what jumped out at me was the tallest bar - if the graph is to be believed, almost 1/4 of the people commute to work between 9:30am and noon. Wow, I'm jealous of all those people sleeping in much later than me! But the more I think about it, the more unlikely that seems ...
Now that I was suspicious of their graph, I looked a little closer, and found that the bars don't represent equal time slices. The first bar represents 5 hours, the next 6 bars represent 30 minutes, then there's a 1-hour bar, another 30-minute bar ... and the last bar represents 2.5 hours (if you can trust the label). Perhaps that explains why the last bar is so surprisingly tall? Time to find out what the data says...
I did some digging and found the ACS commute-time data on the census.gov website. They didn't have an exact 9:30am-noon time slice (for the tall bar), but the three time slices from 9am-noon (circled in red below) only added up to 10% ... nowhere near the 25% value of the tall bar in the original graph. The only thing I can figure is that the original graph is mislabeled, and shows 9:30am-midnight, rather than 9:30am-noon (with an extra 12 hours of commuters, no wonder the bar is so tall, eh!?!)
Now that I understood the data a little better, I tried creating my own infographic. I would have preferred each bar represent the exact same time slice, but the data were not available that way. Therefore I use a red band on the clocks to show the time slice represented by each bar, and also add a footnote indicating that the bars don't represent evenly-spaced time slices. And I decided to leave out the noon-midnight data. How did I make the bars look like roads? ... Simple - I annotated a yellow dashed line up the middle of each black bar!
I think my version is as cute as the original, but is a much more true representation of the data. And at the very least, my graph doesn't have a mislabeled tall bar. Another infographic success for SAS software!
So, which city have you lived in with the worst rush-hour traffic? If you think you've had the longest commute time, post the city & time in a comment (along with any 'tricks' you have for getting through the worst traffic).

You used PROC GCHART here. Do you have any bar charts with the new procedures (i.e. SGPLOT)? I'm trying to make a chart with annotations and about 300 subgroups and my color choices are being limited to 255 with the pattern statements.
255 colors sounds a bit suspicious. Are you sure you want to have that many subgroups & colors in a single chart?!?
I'm making a chart of NCAA tournament performance by conference, year, and team. Subgroups are annotated by year and team (e.g. "2012 Purdue") and colored by team color (NC State red, Carolina blue, etc.) You can see it here: https://i.imgur.com/EcGYEi8.png
It might not be the prettiest thing, but it does exactly what I want until the last two bars where the subgroup count goes above 255 and I can't control the colors any more.
Hmm ... that's too many different colors for my visual tastes, but if you really want >255 colors, perhaps there's a way.
Rather than hard-coding 255+ pattern statements, perhaps you could let ODS supply the colors. Based on the ods style that is in effect, it will run through all the colors, and then when it runs out of colors, it will repeat the color list using a slightly different shade (lighter/darker). Here's an example that generates a Gchart bar chart with 300 subgroup colors (perhaps not the exact colors you want, but at least a way to get >255 colors):
I actually only need 90 different colors. For example, I want 2012 Duke and 2017 Duke to be the same color blue, but I want their bars in two different places.
Getting the team colors exactly right is preferable to having many ODS-supplied colors. I looked into making a custom style with PROC TEMPLATE, but it looks like you can't supply more than a couple dozen colors.
I was able to eke out a few more accurate bars by using "repeat" in some pattern statements where there are consecutive bars of the same color.
Thanks for the help. I got started by looking at your presidential age chart(/democd89/us_presidents_age_bar.htm)
Given your use case, you'll want to use a discrete attributes map to bind the correct colors to the correct college. That way, the correct color will be used, regardless of data order. And, this map can be as large as you want. I created a simple example below. You can also find out more about attrmaps in this blog article: https://blogs.sas.com/content/graphicallyspeaking/2012/02/27/roses-are-red-violets-are-blue/
Thanks for the help Dan! - I think your technique will be especially appropriate, because it makes it easy to map the school colors directly to the school, in a data-driven way!
Thanks, Dan. I can now color the bars perfectly. Now I just need to investigate SG annotation for labeling stacked bars with character text.
Thanks again Dan. I was able to combine the discrete attributes map with SG annotations to get the chart I wanted. Here's what it looks like: https://i.imgur.com/g5DeJxv.png

I think your profile picture should change to a party gif, and your rank should be "BIRTHDAY BOY/GIRL" for the day.
Hello, i have an old Nokia 2310 sitting around and i'd like to use its lcd with my AVR. I've been searching all over the internet but none seems to have used this phone's lcd for any project, so i can't find any info or documentation. The only info i came across is that the same lcd may have been used also in Nokia 1600, 1208, 1209, 2121, 6125, 6136 devices and that the lcd is driven by ST7628 or LDS184. Is there any schematics or libraries for these controllers? Any info?

In this week's Weekend Projects video podcast, Make Magazine's Bre Pettis and I show you how to make a Joule Thief. The PDF file that goes with the podcast is here(450 kB PDF file).
So whatsa Joule Thief? It's a little wisp of a circuit that allows you to drive a blue or white LED from a low voltage. Normally, if you want to light up a blue or white LED you need to provide it with 3 - 3.5 V, like from a 3 V lithium coin cell. But a 1.5 V battery like a AA cell simply will not work. But using the Joule Thief, it works like a charm. Not only does it work with a brand new battery, but it works until the battery is nearly dead-- down to 0.3 V. That's well below the point where your other toys will tell you the battery is dead, so it can steal every last joule of energy from the battery (hence the name). To learn how to make one, watch the video, which is available in a variety of formats.
The original site where we learned about the Joule thief shows you how to make a miniature version of this circuit, such that you can fit it in a tiny flashlight. However, in the video we show you how to make it big, large enough (1) to make with clumsy hands and (2) that you can see what we're doing.
After the jump, some detailed photos of how the coil is wound in case you need more detail than in the video.
It's a little hard to see through my fingers in the video, so here's the detailed view of the coil and winding your own.
First, here is a selection of ferrite toroids, inductors, and transformers that are suitable for using to make a Joule Thief.
Depending on the type that you start with, you may be able to use the existing wires or need to take them off and wind it yourself.
Keep winding until you fit as many turns as will fit in a single layer around the toroid, typically 7-10 turns with thin insulated wire.
Clip the wire leads down. Note that we have two pairs of wires: one coming out the front, and one coming out the back.
In the circuit diagram for the Joule Thief, the common point of the toroid is the connection at the top of the hand-wound ferrite toroid, in the upper right of the diagram. This goes to the positive end of the battery. The other two wires from the toroid go to the resistor and to the intersection of the transistor with the LED.
One other detail that you may need to know is the symbol and pinout of the 2N3904 transistor. In the symbol, the part with the arrow is the "emitter", the "collector" is the end above it, that also connects to the LED, and the "base" is the wire leading off to the left, between the collector and emitter. (Also remember that the end of the LED with the flat side and short lead is the end that has the flat bar in the diagram.)
An actual 2N3904 transistor looks like this. (Well, like this if you're hungry.) The pins, holding it so that you can read the text on the flat side are (left to right) Emitter, Base, and Collector. I particularly like this one because it has that little EBC legend on the bottom.
As a side note, this is not the most efficient circuit around; its beauty is that it works with such a low voltage. So, this is a great circuit to use with a dead or dying battery, and less so for use with a brand new battery.

It began with a solar eclipse on January 1, 1889: A Paiute medicine man named Wovoka had a vision that turned into a movement known as the Ghost Dance. Wovoka’s dream centered on a ceremony he believed would reunite the living with the loved ones in the ghost world, replenish the buffalo, and ultimately restore the world to its original beauty. In his memory, and as a tribute to this important chapter in American Indian history, Devon Archer, a Virginia artist, has created a Painted Pony inspired by the colors and symbols that can be found on the traditional Ghost Dance shirts and dresses.

Opt your pics into responsive behavior ( therefore they definitely not come to be bigger than their parent elements) and include light-weight designs to them-- all by means of classes.
Despite of how effective is the text present inside of our web pages undoubtedly we need to have several as powerful images to back it up having the web content actually shine. And due to the fact that we are actually inside of the mobile phones age we additionally really need those illustrations operating correctly so as to present finest with any sort of screen scale because no one really likes pinching and panning around to be capable to really find what a Bootstrap Image Example stands up to show.
The people behind the Bootstrap framework are completely conscious of that and directly from its start probably the most popular responsive framework has been offering impressive and simple tools for greatest look as well as responsive behaviour of our illustration components. Here is precisely how it work out in current edition.
Within contrast to its antecedent Bootstrap 3 the fourth version uses the class .img-fluid instead of .img-responsive like it used to be. The things this class implies is the Bootstrap Image Placeholder is going to fill up the whole entire width of its container scaling upward or down accordingly to preserve its own proportions. So for pioneers-- make sure you bring in .img-fluid to your <div class="img"><img></div> features whenever you are including them right into Bootstrap 4 powered site webpages.
Illustrations in Bootstrap are actually established responsive by using .img-fluid. max-width: 100%; plus height: auto; are related to the pic to ensure that it sizes together with the parent component.
Once it approaches placement you have the ability to benefit from a few pretty highly effective techniques such as the responsive float assistants, text placement utilities and the .m-x. auto class as follows :
The responsive float devices could be utilized to position an responsive image floating left or right and transform this arrangement depending on the proportions of the current viewport.
This particular classes have made a handful of modifications-- from .pull-left as well as .pull-right within the prior Bootstrap 3 version to
Centralizing the images within Bootstrap 3 used to take place using the .center-block class. Inside of the most recent version of the framework this stuff right now happens through the .m-x. auto class alongside .d-block for you to determine the image to feature just as a block.
Primarily that is simply the technique you can add in simply a few easy classes to get from standard images a responsive ones utilizing the current build of the absolute most prominent framework for building mobile friendly website page. Right now everything that's left for you is picking the suitable ones.

My journey to lose 160 pounds and to finally be able to wear a bathing suit (and look good!) on the beach.

Spring has sprung! Which means that the weather is turning warmer, the days are getting longer, and fitting in outdoor activities is a whole lot easier. Spring is a time of renewal, and in the spring of 2016 I’m living my life in full bloom! Now that I’m losing the weight that I’ve re-gained, the pounds I lose this spring are like petals on a flower, making my life just a bit more beautiful. I want to enjoy each day of this season, soaking in the sunshine, blue skies, and happiness. Sunday weigh-ins will keep me accountable through the weekend, and will give me a positive goal to begin each new week. My Sunday progress updates will be called Super Spring Weigh-Ins.
Week 1 of losing my regain found me slowly getting back on track after that painful reality check of last week’s weigh in when I saw 201.0 on the scale; a number I thought I’d never see again. But sometimes a shock to the system is exactly what it takes to get me moving in the right direction. I was on spring break this week, so I had the time to make some slight, yet significant changes: I went on a hike and worked out at the gym with RDC3, I got in over 10,000 steps on trips to Half Moon Bay (with RDC3 and my parents) and Carmel (with RDC3 and Sofi). I made a grocery run, prepared healthier meals, and had a general sense of things getting back into place.
When I weighed in this morning, I was 199.2, which is a loss of 1.8 pounds this week! I’ve lost a total of 77.8 lbs since surgery and 115.8 pounds from my highest weight!! I have 49.2 pounds to go to my ultimate goal weight of 150 pounds. I’m really happy with this week’s loss. The first pound came off right away when I did my daily weigh-in on Monday; the other 0.8 came off a little at a time as the week continued. Not only did I lose almost 2 pounds without any huge changes to my diet and exercise, but I’m gratefully back in ONEDERLAND. I will never get out of it again!
Today I had an NSV when I texted RDC3 for our Sunday weight loss accountability update. We’ve both gained weight since we’ve been together, so we’ve decided that enough is enough and it’s time to get serious about getting these pounds off. He’s as committed to living a healthy lifestyle as I am, which is so nice. This is a whole new experience for me, because while I’ve had lots of great female friends who are weight loss buddies, I’ve never shared the weight loss journey with a boyfriend before. That’s where the milestone comes in. I’ve never, ever shared my actual weight with someone I was dating before. EVER. Even last week when I had that fateful weigh-in, I told RDC3 how much I’d gained, but not the actual number on the scale. Today when I texted him my update, I told him the number. Gulp! He knew what it meant to me to be able to feel safe in sharing that with him, and he was so supportive. He cheered on the fact that I’d lost 1.8 lbs, and didn’t make it a big deal about the 201. Which means absolutely everything to me. As he said, “we should be able to share everything with each other.” And I couldn’t agree more. That’s one of the many reasons I know that this is IT!
Phew! This week has been quite productive, when I look back at everything. I faced the scale, made some easy changes, saw weight loss results, shared my weight with my boyfriend, and made lots of updates on my blog. Progress!!
Until next Sunday, my friends. I hope the scale treats you well, and that you have a wonderful week!

Before I get into my joining in on the ToneItUp Bikini Series again this year, I thought I should take a moment to get real. It’s been quite some time since I updated my weight on this blog (or even on MFP, for that matter). I’ve mentioned in a previous post that throughout the fall and winter, my workouts and eating had been a bit sporadic. I did workouts some days, but nothing extremely consistent, as I had been. I ate pretty well, but did let more carbs and “snacks” creep into my diet, especially as the holidays approached. And I gained about 13 pounds from my lowest weight of 170, meaning that on Sunday, April 12th I weighed in at 183.0. I wasn’t overly surprised by this gain; my clothes had started to fit a bit snugger and my face didn’t look as thin as it had in late summer. At the same time, I know that in my pre-WLS days not eating great and not working out for 6 months would have netted a gain of much more than 13 pounds. Which is why I’m so grateful for this VSG tool. It helps to keep me in line with my portion sizes and helps me make sure that things don’t ever get totally out of control. 13 pounds I can deal with.
ToneItUp is at it again – helping people get “bikini ready” in the 8 weeks before summer. Since this is their 5th year of the Bikini Series, they decided to kick things off a bit earlier, so this year’s Bikini Series will end on June 6th. Just like last year, I decided to join in on the fun, and immediately signed up for the Bikini Series. Unlike last year, I’ve become a full-fledged member of the TIUTeam this year. I bought the TIU Nutrition Program, which includes 1000s of recipes and meal ideas. Once you buy the Nutrition Program, you’re a member for life; you’re never charged more and you get seasonal additions to the plan. This year for the 5th Bikini Series, they came out with an 8-week meal plan, making it that much easier to follow the TIU suggested meals. They even included a grocery list and meal prep guide. With all this built in organization and healthy eating, I just couldn’t wait to start on April 12th.
To prepare, I hit Sprouts and Trader Joe’s on Saturday, and spent some time meal prepping so that I’d be ready to start my day on Sunday with all the foods I needed for the early part of the day.
Then I spent a few hours on Sunday prepping food for the rest of the week. I’m really enjoying the recipes they suggested, and have been liking trying some new ingredients like shredded coconut and almond flour, trying new meals like chia pudding, and eating a bit more calories than I’m used to. Since their meals are all based around clean, whole foods, upping the calories hasn’t been departmental to my weight loss. I have had to cut the portion sizes to fit my post-WLS tummy, but that’s been pretty simple. At this point, almost 2 years post-op, I know how much I can eat in one sitting. (So, instead of eating 6oz of mahi mahi, I eat 4oz). I love how colorful and full of flavor the meals are, and I’m eating a ton of fruits and veggies. The recipes themselves are all pretty easy to make, which is a plus.
Breakfast: Blueberry Zest muffins, strawberries, and 1/2 protein shake (I added this in lieu of almond milk because it has more protein)
Lunch: Spinach, tuna w/ wasabi mayo (this is another one of my own meals, not strictly on the plan, but within most of their guidelines)
Another thing I really like about the Tone It Up approach is that it’s not just about food and working out (although those are super-important!), it’s also about the mindset you have. They suggested setting goals to accomplish throughout the Bikini Series:
I’m really proud of the fact that this week, I woke up and did my “bootycalls” (morning workouts) all 5 days before work! It wasn’t always easy, but I made it happen, and I really do think my day went better because I got the workout in early and felt so energized. I also love creating the photo collages I put up on IG every morning, like this one I did today:
As you can see, I’m already well on my goal of hitting 100 miles by summer! I’m doing so well on this goal that I may increase it to 150 miles by summer – I want to wait another week and see how many I log after two weeks before I make the switch.
Another huge part of the Tone It Up philosophy is women supporting and encouraging each other. Last year I started following tons of other TIU girls on IG, liking and commenting on their photos. This year I decided to amp it up a bit by joining two new groups on FB dedicated to TIU. One is a general TIU Bikini Series group that has people from all over the world in it. It’s been a fun place to share ideas, ask questions, and get encouragement. I also joined a more local TIU group on FB for other TIU girls who live in the South SF Bay Area. This is the group I’m most excited about because it’s full of other women who live in my area. We’ve already scheduled a few meetups, one of which is happening next Thursday at a spinning studio that I’ve never been to. I can’t wait to meet some new friends who share my interest in maintaining a healthy, active lifestyle.
Lots of the TIU ladies were nervous about posting their “before” photos online, but I wasn’t. These aren’t my before photos – you guys know that I started this weight loss journey at my all-time heaviest weight of 315. I’m really proud of what I’ve accomplished since then, so these photos are a badge of honor to me. And I just can’t wait to see how much slimmer I look in my “after” photos at the end of the 8 weeks.
Oh, and another point of inspiration – this morning when I weighed myself I was already down 1.4 lbs since Sunday, weighing in at 181.6. Not bad for 5 days. Especially considering that I increased my calories from an average of 900/day to about 1200/day.
I’m thrilled with the choice I made to join the Bikini Series again this year, and I’m really looking forward to all of the positive things that will come of it.

Autumn has (almost officially) arrived! Which means that life is back to normal – school’s in, my schedule is busy, and obligations abound. But I won’t use those as excuses to slack on my goals. The great thing about fall is that the weather is cooler, which means that those wonderful fall fashions will keep me motivated. Plus, crisp temperatures mean that it’s never “too hot” to workout. I’m going to relish my nightly cup of steaming hot tea as another way to keep my water intake up. I look forward to all those hearty, satisfying and wls-friendly soups, stews, and crockpot meals that I’ll create for myself. This year, the changing season will mark new milestones that I haven’t seen in 5, 7, 10+ years! Bring on fall 2014 – it’s time to reach new heights! Wednesday weigh-ins will keep me accountable through the work week, and will give me a positive outlook for the weekend. Throughout the fall, I’ll be giving Wednesday weight loss updates called WonderFALL Weigh-Ins.
Week 68 was busy, hectic and long. So much so that I didn’t even have time to write a weight loss update. I actually didn’t even have a chance to weigh in at all until this morning. So, here’s a midweek weigh-in update. Even though the week was super busy, I did a good fairly job with my meal planning, eating, and exercising.
When I weighed in this morning, I was 171.0, which is a loss of 1.2 pounds this week, and a loss of 106 lbs since surgery! I’ve lost a total of 144 pounds from my highest weight!! I have 21 pounds to go to my ultimate goal weight of 150 pounds. I’m really happy to see this loss, especially because I haven’t really been putting as much concentration on weight loss this week. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve made great meals, gotten in some solid workouts, and continued to eat within my meal plan. The nice thing about this point in my journey is that I don’t have to think about all of these things as much as I used to. They’ve become such a habit, such a way of life, that I can go on “auto-pilot” during a crazy week and still see a good result. That makes me feel awesome.
This week shouldn’t be quite as busy so I’ll have more time to concentrate on working out and meal planning. I’m not going to go into too many details here, because I’ll write a weekly workout plan post in a few minutes.
I’m so close to reaching the next weight category – the 160s!! I can’t wait to hit that section, because I haven’t been at that weight since I was 18 years old. It’s so cool that now at 43, I’ll be even fitter than I was when I was 18. Back then, I wasn’t wearing size small and medium tops or size 10/12 pants, and I think the difference is that I’ve really changed my entire body with the cardio and toning workouts I’ve been doing. It’s amazing to see such a transformation in my body, and each time I hit a new NSV with clothes, it’s so surreal to me.

Week 67 was a pretty good one. I made some great meals, got in a few strong workouts, and even took a long walk when I wasn’t feeling that great over the weekend.
When I weighed in this morning, I was 172.2, which is a maintain this week, and a loss of 104.8 lbs since surgery! I’ve lost a total of 142.8 pounds from my highest weight!! I have 22.2 pounds to go to my ultimate goal weight of 150 pounds. I can’t lie, I’m disappointed that I didn’t see a loss on the scale this week, because I’ve been putting in work and eating right. But when I look at the week, I did skip two weekday workouts and I wasn’t feeling great this weekend, so I didn’t do as much as I normally would have. I ate a lot more carbs and less protein than I should’ve late last week (in the form of a chicken pesto pizza that lasted for 3 meals). I’m not too upset about this maintain, because I know it’s only temporary. It also shows me that at this point in my journey, I need to push harder in order to see a loss on the scale.
So far this week (the past two days), I’ve been getting in strong workouts, following the Tone It Up Frisky Fall Challenge. This morning my legs are really feeling the squats, lunges, and other moves that I’ve been doing. I love pushing myself with the toning workouts. I’ve also resumed C25K, and I was pleasantly surprised that I felt strong in my runs even though I’d taken so much time off from running training. My main workout goal this week is to make sure I get in all my weekday workouts, not allowing myself to skip any because I’m tried, which usually happens around Thursday or Friday.
In terms of food, things are going well. As I mentioned above, toward the end of last week and into the weekend I wasn’t making the best food choices. I kept my calories under my daily goal, but I wasn’t eating enough protein and veggies. I know this is a main reason the scale didn’t move this week. I know better. I know that in order to lose weight, I need to eat well, not just keep the calories within my limits. It’s much more important to keep WHAT I’m eating in check. Eating out several meals in one week doesn’t lead to weight loss. It would’ve been better for me to eat that chicken pesto pizza for just the one meal and leave the rest. I need to release myself from the idea of “wasting food,” and continuing to eat a heavy carb and fat with little protein meal several times just so that I don’t feel wasteful. Indulging for one meal is one fine, but eating that same meal three times because I have leftovers isn’t good for my weight loss goals. From now on if I go out and indulge in a meal that doesn’t really fit in with my plan, I’m going to enjoy that one meal and leave the leftovers at the restaurant because it’s just not worth the damage it does. So far this week, I’ve done a good job with balancing my protein, veggies, and carbs.
If anything, this maintain is going to spur me to push myself harder this week. I don’t want to see another maintain on the scale next week, and I’m determined to make sure that I see a new loss. I’m so close to a new weight “decade,” and I’ve love to move into the 160s next week which is completely doable – I’d only need a loss of 2.4 lbs. I’m going to keep that number in mind and use it to motivate myself in my workout and in my food choices. Here’s to moving forward!
Until next Wednesday, my friends. I hope the scale treats you well, and that you have a wonderful week!

Week 66 was really good. I’m getting into the swing of this new schedule, and making it all work with my food prep and workouts. When I can, I’m working out in the morning; when that’s out, I workout after work. Add to that lots of fun with family and friends over the Labor Day weekend, and it was a nice week for sure.
When I weighed in this morning, I was 172.2, which is a loss of 1.4 pounds this week, and a loss of 104.8 lbs since surgery! I’ve lost a total of 142.8 pounds from my highest weight!! I have 22.2 pounds to go to my ultimate goal weight of 150 pounds. I’m really happy with this loss because I had a similar loss last week. It’s nice that I’m back on a losing streak, even with so many changes in my work life.
This week I have been pulling out some old recipes to enjoy, including the Lowfat Curry Chicken and a new stir fry, which had tofu, mushrooms, onions, zucchini, sugar snap peas, and edamame. It’s nice to make big pot meals that I can eat several times throughout the week. I can’t wait for the weather to get cooler so I can start making my favorite crockpot meals. So hearty and easy!
Workouts have been really good this week: spinning, elliptical, biking, walking Sofi, and of course, my Tone It Up routines. The other day I had a hair appointment, and my stylist asked me what races I have coming up. I told her that I’d taken the summer off from my C25K training, and I wasn’t sure if I wanted to run anymore, that it was so hard for me. And then I stopped myself and said, “you know, that’s not like me at all. I never give up on something just because it’s hard. I really need to get back with my C25K training and make my goal to fully run a 5K happen.” And so that’s exactly what I’m going to do. The Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving is about 11 1/2 weeks away, which is more than enough time to complete the C25K training and continue afterward so that I can improve my runs before the 5K. So, starting next week, I’m going to get back to running intervals, working my way up to full 5K runs, and I’m excited!
I watch TrulyJess‘ vlogs on YouTube almost every night (if you’ve never seen her videos, watch them, she’s such an inspiration!), and one of her sayings is that weight loss, training, etc is You vs. You. In other words, I’m not in competition with anyone else, except myself. And the 5K training is a perfect example of this philosophy.

Week 65 has been wonderful! I had a great weekend, filled with bike rides, walks with Sofi, spending time with friends, watching my 49ers win, and relaxing after a very busy first week on the new job. So far this work week has been really productive. I’m finding my rhythm as I meet with new teachers, gather resources for them, and keep track of all the notes and paperwork. I can already tell I’m going to love this new position, and I’m so glad that I took the chance and went for one of my goals. Monday I rewarded myself with a shopping spree at Dress Barn, buying tons of new clothes for my fall wardrobe. The neat thing about this shopping trip was that I think these clothes might last for more than one season. I’m wearing tops/sweaters in size medium and small (SMALL!!!!!), skirts in medium, and 2 pairs of pants in a size 10! I got a great camel-color water-resistant hooded trench in a medium that I can’t wait to wear because it’s so flattering.
When I weighed in this morning, I was 173.6, which is a loss of 1.6 pounds this week***, and a loss of 103.4 lbs since surgery! I’ve lost a total of 141.4 pounds from my highest weight!! I have 23.6 pounds to go to my ultimate goal weight of 150 pounds. ***The cool thing about this loss is that it only reflects the last two days, because my last weigh-in was on Sunday. 1.6 pounds in two days is phenomenal! I’m on a losing streak, and I’m loving it! Especially considering how busy my days have suddenly become.
What am I doing differently? Lately I’ve been concentrating on making sure to get several servings of veggies in with most meals, and I think that’s making a big difference. I’m still allowing myself the popcorn I love, but only a few times a week. And of course, protein is at the heart of every meal I eat. And I’m still getting plenty of exercise and drinking lots of water. Still, I’ve also been having a few glasses of wine on the weekend, but that doesn’t seem to be affecting my weight loss in the least, which is nice. I love this lifestyle that I’ve created!
In terms of exercise, I’ve been really proud of the workouts I’ve been fitting in. I did wake up early on Monday to get in a before-work sweat session, which left me feeling super energized and positive all day long. Most days I’ve worked out in the afternoon, and I enjoy those after work sessions as a way to transition from work mode to relax mode. As long as I’m getting a workout in, I’m ok with whatever time of day it is. I actually enjoy working out now, so I look forward to moving my body, rather than dreading it as I used to. I really think one of the reasons is the communities of support that I’m part of on MyFitnessPal and Instagram. I love snapping post-workout pics and tagging them with with my ToneItUp hashtags, and seeing all my #TIUsisters’ posts, too. On MFP, every time I workout it posts a status, and the outpouring of love I get from my pals spurs me on and makes me smile.
As much as I’ve absolutely enjoyed this summer, I have to admit I’m really looking forward to the true start of autumn. The crisp, cool mornings and evenings. The sunny days that aren’t ever too warm. The changing colors of the leaves, the decorations, and the outfits. Not to mention all the fun that comes with football season, pumpkin patches, Halloween, and simply sipping cups of coffee, tea, and maybe even a pumpkin spice latte or two. This year I think I’d like to go apple picking, because it just sounds like so much fun and I’ve never done it before. What are some quintessential fall things you love to do at this time of year? Help me create a fall bucket list.

It’s summertime! Which means that school is out, my schedule is my own, and I’m footloose and fancy free. Summer means the weather is warm, the sun is shining, and I can kick my workouts (and my weight loss!) into high gear. I have less than 30 pounds to go to reach my ultimate weight loss goal, and I plan to lose quite a bit of that this summer. But this summer is about so much more than losing weight; it’s about living my new life. I worked so hard for this new, healthy body, and I want to spend this summer doing a lot of the things I only dreamed of doing when I was at my heaviest. That means riding rollercoasters, running in 5Ks, trying new water sports, wearing styles (and sizes!) of clothes that I could never wear before. I want to LIVE every moment of this summer to the fullest. I’ve moved my weigh-ins to Wednesdays as a way to check in midweek. My Wednesday progress updates will be called Sensational Summer Weigh-Ins.
Week 64 was quite a whirlwind, evidenced by the fact that I skipped reporting on Week 63 last week (I actually didn’t have a loss during Week 63), and missed my usual weigh-in report this Wednesday. Nevertheless, this week was an amazing one for so many reasons. I started a new job, was getting used to an entirely new schedule, enjoyed a great Trombone Shorty concert on Wednesday, and spent time with friends at the Italian Festa yesterday.
When I weighed in this morning, I was 175.2, which is a loss of 2.2 pounds this week, and a loss of 101.8 lbs since surgery! I’ve lost a total of 139.8 pounds from my highest weight!! I have 25.2 pounds to go to my ultimate goal weight of 150 pounds. I’m really excited with my weight loss progress this week, because my schedule was such a drastic change from what I’ve been used to. Not only are my lazy days of summer gone, but this new position has me running around to 5 different campuses, scheduling multiple meetings a day, and working longer hours in the office than I would as a teacher. I tried my best to wake up at 5am to get workouts in before work, but wasn’t able to any of the days. Still, I packed my gym bag and went after work a few times, even though I was dog-tired. I also took the time on Monday night to prep meals for the week, making sure I stayed on track. I’m really proud of my commitment to my health in the face of all these extra responsibilities.
To set myself up for success this week, I’m going to meal prep tonight. Breakfasts are easy – my protein shakes are simple to make and help me keep my protein intake high. Lunches that I’ve been loving are salads made of spinach paired with all sorts of protein – tuna, chicken, and shrimp. Dinners this week will be a nice combo of protein, veggies, and complex carbs: lentils with turkey meatballs and spinach, mahi mahi burgers and zoodles, and chicken with summer squash.
I’m still going to give it my best to get up and workout before I head into work, but I am also ok with my backup plan of hitting the gym after work. The gym is on my way home, so it makes it convenient to stop in before I get too relaxed. Plus, working out after work is a great way to switch gears from work mode to relaxation mode. I’m not going to put too much pressure on myself to workout in the mornings these first few weeks, until I get used to my new schedule. As long as I get my workouts in, that’s all that really matters.

Actress Sofia Vergara is involved in a lawsuit with her own fertilized frozen embryos and the implications could have far-reaching effect on many other families in the future.
While the Modern Family star was still engaged to ex Nick Loeb, Vergara had her embryos frozen to preserve her chances of conceiving with Loeb after they got married. The couple broke up and Vergara sought to have the embryos destroyed but given that they contain part of Loeb’s DNA and were created from that union and consent, Loeb is getting creative in his attempts to keep the embryos.
Get this: for purposes of the lawsuit, the embryos have names, Emma and Isabella, as listed in Louisiana court documents that the New York Post obtained.
In a new lawsuit, a trustee is named as the plaintiff and the case alleges that the embryos will be deprived of their inheritance from Vergara by not being born.
Given that the state of Louisiana is considered “pro-life” and therefore fertilized eggs are seen as a “juridicial person”, there is a good chance that the embryos may win their suit and be transferred to Loeb so they can be born.
It is presumed, he will find a surrogate to carry the embryos to term. Currently, the embryos are located in California.
As we learned from the other famous celebrity case involving Sherri Shepherd, we know that a judge could hold a celebrity financially responsible for a child conceived during a relationship but born after the relationship ended.
However, in that case, the embryos had already been implanted and were on their way to being born when the split occurred.
In the UK, in 2003, a judge there determined that embryos could not be born without the full consent of both parents.

This recipe was inspired by my Facebook friend from the U.K. , Carlene...Who ,according to her status update was busy baking an Apple Crumble pie...I haven't had good Apple Crumble in about two years...Here is a quick an easy recipe that should make for a great dessert.
3. Bake in preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until apples are soft and top is lightly browned.
Preheat the oven to the temperature the recipe you are following recommends. Most fruit pies bake at a temperature of between 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Some recipes call for baking the pie in a 450 degree F oven for the first part of baking, then turning down the oven to about 350 degrees F. This helps set the shape of the crust in recipes that contain a lot of fat; it can keep your crust from slouching.
Hey Keith, my sons favorite pie is the apple crumble. This recipe looks good but I still can not abide a store bought crust. If your readers are buyers I suggest the Pillsbury Just Unroll crust. The other products are like eating cardboard.
Here's my recipe for a double crust. It uses vodka and water. The vodka has no specific taste but allows for a wet dough that rolls out easily and bakes up "tender."
I use the food processor to mix the flour, salt, and sugar. "Cut in" the butter and shortening by using 8 or 9 short pulses. Sprinkle the vodka and water over the flour/butter/crisco mixture and process about 5 or 6 pulses. You've got pie crust!! Divide the dough in half and rest it at least 40 minutes in the refrigerator. Roll it out for the bottom crust and rest it for 20 minutes in the freezer. Use plenty of flour on the surface to roll out the dough. Add the filling and top with the reamining rolled out dough. This crust makes any filling taste great!!
Hey I inspired a recipe! lol I just love apple crumble, with hot custard and ice cream. I'm a dessert addict.
Cold temperatures slow the growth of bacteria. Ensuring that your refrigerator temperature stays at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or colder is one of the most effective ways to reduce your risk of food-borne illness. You can buy a refrigerator/freezer thermometer at appliance stories, home centers (i.e. Home Depot), and kitchen stores including online ones, such as Cooking.com.
Perishable foods should never be thawed on the counter for longer than two hours because, while the center of the food may remain frozen, the outer surface may enter the Danger Zone, the range of temperatures between 40 and 140 degrees fahrenheit, in which bacteria multiply rapidly. If you’re short on time, use the microwave or you can thaw meat and poultry in airtight packaging in cold water. Change the water every half-hour so it stays cold and use the thawed food immediately.
Bacteria from uncooked meat, poultry, and fish can contaminate cooked foods and fresh produce. An important way to reduce this risk is to use separate cutting boards for raw meat/poultry/ fish, and cooked foods/fresh produce.
One effective way to prevent illness is to use a food thermometer to check the internal temperature of meat, poultry, and egg dishes. The USDA Recommended Safe Minimum Internal Temperatures are as follows:
Cook meats like roasts and steaks to lower temperatures, closer to medium-rare, so that they retain their moisture. It is recommended that those who are at high risk for developing food-borne illness (i.e. pregnant women and their unborn babies, newborns, young children, older adults, people with weakened immune systems, or certain chronic illnesses) should follow the USDA guidelines.
5. Avoid unpasteurized/raw milk and cheeses made from unpasteurized milk that are aged less than 60 days.
Raw milk is milk from cows, sheep, or goats that has not been pasteurized (heated to a very high temperature for a specific length of time) to kill harmful bacteria that may be present. These bacteria, which include salmonella, E. coli and listeria, can cause serious illness and sometimes even death. The bacteria in raw milk can be especially dangerous to pregnant women, children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems or chronic illnesses. Raw milk cheeses aged 60 days or longer are okay, since the salt and acidity of the cheese-making process make for a hostile environment to pathogens.
Even eggs that have clean, intact shells may be contaminated with salmonella, so it’s important to cook eggs thoroughly until both the yolk and the white are firm. Casseroles and other dishes containing eggs should be cooked to 160 degrees fahrenheit and you can use an instant-read food thermometer to check. Eggs should always be cooked fully and those who are at high risk for developing foodborne illness (pregnant women and their unborn babies, newborns, young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems or certain chronic illnesses should follow the USDA guidelines. If you can’t resist runny eggs or sampling cookie batter, use pasteurized eggs. They’re found near other eggs in large supermarkets.
7. Always wash your hands in warm soapy water for at least 20 seconds before handling food and after touching raw meat, poultry, or eggs.
You can pick up a lot of bacteria out in the world, so it’s important to always wash your hands before you eat or prepare food. You should also wash your hands after touching any uncooked meat, poultry, fish, or eggs, as the bacteria from these foods can contaminate cooked foods and fresh produce. Use soap and warm water and wash thoroughly for at least 20 seconds.
9. Never eat meat, poultry, eggs, or sliced fresh fruits and vegetables that have been left out for more than two hours or more than one hour in temperatures hotter than 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
If you leave perishable foods out of the refrigerator or freezer for more than two hours they may enter the Danger Zone—the unsafe temperatures between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit, in which bacteria multiply rapidly.
You should discard any food that’s been recalled because it’s associated with the outbreak of a food-borne illness. But, according to a survey conducted by Rutgers University during the fall of 2008, only about 60% of Americans search their homes for foods that have been recalled because of contamination. For more information on food recalls, visit the website Recalls.gov

At least 3 people have asked me in the last two days if I intend to post something on that seriously underwhelming NYT article by John Tierney that was published a couple of days ago. In it, Tierney postulates, YET AGAIN that there is a gender disparity in science because there are more men at the very upper end of the IQ scale than there are women. What was my response to everyone and their mother asking me if I was going to post on this topic- Yawn, yawn, and yawn again. Apparently a plethora of other women scientist bloggers had the same reaction- and honestly, I could never have said it better than Female Science Professor or Isis– responses, in my humble opinion, completely spot on.
Then one of my science BFF sent me this article that appeared in the Daily Mail recently written by the estimable Professor Richard Lynn. Ok, this time my response was less like yawn, yawn and yawn again and more like puke, puke, and puke again (on Richard’s shoes- a la Zuska). This little gem goes further than Tierney… I’ll just quote what Dr. Lynn said in the Daily Mail:
So here goes: one of the main reasons why there are not more female science professors or chief executives or cabinet ministers is that, on average, men are more intelligent than women.
Dr. Lynn says that he has reached this conclusion from ‘a lifetime of academic research’- and he is aware that this explanation will unleash ‘howls of feminist outrage‘.
I love my mom. A LOT. And my dad- well, the quirky sense of humor stands out (Please- I need a break from personal revelations for a while) but really the importance of my dad in my life and career trajectory can not be underestimated.
So thanks go to you Mom and Dad- you stood behind me no matter what, supporting me through so much (I’m sure you never thought I’d be off your payroll), helping me through everything from the trivial- being heartbroken over that guy in high school, to the more momentous- moves, marriage, career transitions, a tenure track job, the death of friends, the birth of children, and the juggling of a million responsibilities. I see now from raising my own kids that what you go through with me isn’t easy (and I don’t even have direct personal experience raising my own teenager yet). Thanks for your quiet calm, your jokes at all the right moments, and mostly your love and support. I’m tremendously lucky to have you as parents.

The collective SynergySheffield recently released a self published collection of images online 001 is designed to provide an insight into the working minds of the six artists below is a link to publication
Art and nature for me come hand in hand, I view art making as a natural process in commune with the natural world even an extension of it. Creativity itself is an extension of our ability to interact with reality and material existence, most art through its materiality as Andy Goldsworthy describes ‘has this amazing ability to show you what’s there’. In other words it can serve as a route to a more conscious state, one that we all used to be in until we became urbanised and left nature behind us, as a separate entity. I would like to have a deeper connection to the natural world, and develop a more profound connection with material’s, like the artists Goldsworthy and Richard Long Below.
We are so sorry that we have been so lame in posting anything on here in such a long time that it seems like I have not been on here, in like, forever. So what have we been doing? One of us has got a traineeship in Italy whoop and will be moving there soon so thats exciting whilst I am creating new art and freelancing. So all in all very busy, speaking of art check out the new work below, let me know what you think? Its called Borghese Speculation, pencil on paper, 2012, and its part one of a triptich exploring the boundries between individualism and collectivism, Self and other. Furthermore it investigates recent social events within the media, i.e Murdoch’s Hacking scandal which brought up a quite nasty side to todays new’s industry. Below that is some music, Enjoy

Jon has known me since I was a toddler, his mom and my mom were really close friends. Funny thing is, Matt has known Danina for a long time as well! They used to work together.
Though we’ve all stayed in touch on social media, we haven’t seen them in years. Until just recently when I became a part of the Silver Drop Society. I saw Danina and Jon at the Silver Drop Society Retreat, I took their professional headshot, then shortly after we booked this mini session with their whole family.
This is one of the hidden blessings of being a photographer. I get to reconnect with old friends, hang out with them, and bless them with the talents God blessed me with.
Those red boots! I had to take a photo of them. Why? Because they are the only shoes this angel baby will wear! Jon and Danina think it’s because she can put them on herself. Whatever the reason, I love it! They are so cute and she beams with personality. Can you tell from these next photos of her?
These photos are from a mini story session day we just hosted. We gifted 5×7 picture frames, had a craft for the kids, warmed up with coffee and peppermint hot chocolate, and thoroughly enjoyed our time making memories.
If you are interested in one of these Mini Story Session Days, please contact us. We would love to make memories with you and your family, then document the whole process!

This company are absolutely brilliant. I used to previously trade as a carpenter so I always have high expectations of any fellow tradesmen. The team were very thorough and they certainly know their craft inside out. They took photos of the original offending roof to show, and explain clearly to me, what work would be involved to replace it with fibreglass. They quoted by the metre and I was happy with their price. During the work, I took great interest in what they were doing and every step of the process was explained clearly and patiently. They were friendly, professional and extremely punctual – they said they would be here at 8am and they were – when they had to nip to the suppliers, they said they would be gone for 20 mintues – 20 minutes later they were back. They are also very hard-working – I went to pick up my grandchildren and left the door open for them to go inside and have a break – when I returned, they were still on the roof working away and had not taken a break.
I am very pleased with the high quality service that was provided by Five Star Roof Systems and in my opinion, you could not find a better firm to carry out this work and they are a credit to the Fibreglass Trade. In fact I was so pleased, I have booked them in to return on the 28th April 2011 to do my garage roof. I have no qualms whatsoever recommending them to anyone and would be happy if anyone wanted to view the work that they did on my property.
Within our school, we had a problem with leaking in some of our flat roofs – the source of these leaks could not be found, therefore in order to resolve this ongoing issue long-term, we decided to replace the felt with fibreglass. The Fivestar Fibreglass Roof team provide an excellent service – they are professional, extremely punctual and trustworthy. They turn up and just get on with the job. They did one roof about two months ago and we have them back again today doing another. I would have no hesitation recommending this company to anyone.
I had my garage roof replaced with fibreglass. When the work commenced, it was discovered that the roof timbers also needed replacing and the team went over and above the expectation by just getting on with sorting out what ever was necessary. They were friendly and professional and I would most definitely recommend them to anyone.
Brian George, owner of Co-Vista Holsteins is pictured on the right, with his sons, and Alta District Sales Manager, Duncan Bailey.
Co-Vista Holsteins of Arcade, NY, takes great pride in breeding elite animals that perform in both the parlor and the showring. Buying, selling and marketing their own cattle helps them stand out amongst many of the operations we typically see today. With a focus on production but an interest in type, the George family has worked hard to develop a custom genetic plan to develop animals that meet their high standards.
When Brian George took over the farm from his parents, he remembered well the days of milking in a 60-cow tie-stall barn. The farm, which was first purchased in 1992, was quickly expanding, and the family soon grew tired of switching cattle in and out of stalls. With progressive dairying on Brian’s mind, the decision was made to build a new freestall and parlor facility.
The blueprints to build a double-12 parallel parlor, along with several freestall barns, were drawn and the family soon got to work. The expansion was complete in 2003, and the herd grew to just over 400 milking cows. With no plans of expansion in the near future, the George family hopes to continue building on the genetics within their herd.
Efficiency was the top priority at Co-Vista as they made the decision to switch to Alta nearly two years ago. Tired of seeing inconsistent results with their previous semen company, the George Family chose to invest in a plan which would better suit the needs of their farm.
Because of the customized approach, they decided to join the the Alta Advantage program, with a customized genetic plan set with 45% on production, 35 on health and 20 on conformation. Since joining the Advantage program, the family has been pleased with the added value created while using Alta semen.
Milk production is just one of the areas where the George’s have seen improvements. With the goal of someday having the highest herd average in the state of New York, Co-Vista Holsteins puts a large emphasis on milk production. Focusing not only on health and type traits, but production traits as well, has helped the animals at Co-Vista excel in the milk parlor.
Reproduction protocols are taken seriously at Co-Vista. They strictly follow the recommended 14-11 day pre-synch/ov-synch program along with additional tail chalking. Each service is treated as an investment in an animal’s genetic potential. After their 60-day voluntary wait period, animals are bred to the best bulls based on their genetics, creating new generations of high quality cattle.
Knowing good management is key on any operation, the family has used DairyComp to put the spotlight on their standard operating procedures, working to fine tune and progress their operation even further. Whether it be from working to advance the care of their youngstock to improving conception rates, details matter at Co-Vista Holsteins.
Brian George, owner of Co-Vista Holsteins, set his custom genetic plan with 45% weight on production, 35% weight on health and 20% on conformation to drive progress toward his farm's goals
“I want to be more than just a manager,” Brian George noted as he looked at his two young sons playing off in the distance. “I want to be a motivator. Dairying is one of the few businesses where you can measure your progress daily, and I want to ensure we are continuing to improve with each passing day.”
Most of us misunderstand heritability. In simple terms, for any given trait, heritability tells us how much of the difference in actual performance is due to genetics, as opposed to management or the environment.
To better understand, think about two cows in two different herds. How much of the difference in their milk production is due to genetics? How much is due to management or environment? It turns out about 30% of the milk production difference is due to genetics, while 70% is due to management and environment. Therefore, milk has a heritability of 0.30.
What about pregnancy rates? Management and environment account for the 96% majority of variation between daughters. So the influence of genetics is minor, at just 4%. Thus, Daughter Pregnancy Rate (DPR) has a heritability of 0.04.
We commonly refer to the health traits like Productive Life (PL), DPR and Somatic Cell Score (SCS) as the lower heritability traits. Many producers believe that low heritability equates to less, or slower, genetic progress. However, in spite of lower heritability, it would be wrong to conclude that DPR, PL or SCS are insignificant as a result.
In genetics, accuracy shows through when we evaluate results within one herd. In that herd, if we evaluate within a specific lactation group, and then within a specific time of freshening, we find a contemporary group. By evaluating within one contemporary group, we reduce the impact of management and environmental differences.
The overall heritability for health traits like DPR and PL is low. When we break our evaluations down into contemporary groups, that’s when we find the true genetic differences.
Take this real-life example from a 1,500-cow dairy with very good reproductive performance. We’ve separated out first lactation cows into four groups, based on their sire’s DPR. It’s clear to see that the high DPR sires create daughters that become pregnant more quickly than the daughters of low DPR sires.
The same goes for Productive Life. Despite the low heritability at less than 9%, PL can make a real, noticeable difference in your herd.
This table compares how long the daughters of the industry’s best ten PL bulls and daughters of the industry’s bottom ten PL sires will last in a given herd. You can see that a higher percentage of high PL daughters, represented by the dark blue bars, remain in a herd than their low PL counterparts.
When you select for the lowly heritable PL, you will certainly create healthier, longer-living cows in your herd.
As a progressive dairy producer, don’t let confusion about heritability prevent you from using the right genetic tools to improve your herd. Health traits are economically important, and making improvement in these areas can have a huge impact on your bottom line.
Many traits have a high heritability, but no economic importance. In other words, we can make a lot of progress for these traits very quickly, but it will not make a more profitable cow.
A couple examples of high heritability traits are coat color and polled. Both of these traits have a heritability of 100 percent because they are completely controlled by genetics. However, even if we can make cows red or polled in one generation, what is the economic value of that?
By comparison, the economic value of more fertile cows that last longer because of fewer metabolic problems, fewer cases of mastitis, and less calving difficulty is clear to see. These genetic features make a more profitable production unit for each and every farm.
When you set or reevaluate your genetic plan, take the following tips into account to maximize progress in the direction of your goals.
To set the right goals, first identify the most common reasons for culling in your herd. Is it reproduction, milk production, mastitis? This information gives you the basis for the genetic decisions you make going forward.
Health traits offer dairy producers some powerful tools to help correct for low reproduction, metabolic problems, etc. Identify how important each of these trouble areas are to you. Place a proportionate emphasis on these traits when choosing the group of sires to use on your dairy.
Industry standard selection indexes put different and continually changing weights on health traits. So don’t assume they reflect your individual goals and needs. Work with your trusted Alta advisor to make sure your genetic plan is customized to match your current situation and future goals.

Bluewater Thermal Solutions' hardening process enlists a wide variety of heat treatment techniques designed to increase the hardness, strength, and fatigue life of metal parts and components.
Continuous mesh belt furnaces are available for processing large volumes of small parts such as fasteners, bearings, stampings, and washers at competitive rates.
We specialize in hardening large castings and forgings using atmosphere-controlled continuous furnaces that prevent decarburization and scaling.
Prevention of scaling eliminates the need for blasting to clean parts and remove scale after heat treatment, which can be very costly.
Hot oil quenching and hot salt mar quenching are utilized to minimize warpage on distortion-prone parts.
We have equipment specifically designed to handle the unique challenges associated with heat treating powdered metals.
Our unique multi-plant capability to perform hardening in multiple locations provides built-in emergency backup and contingency planning.
The hardening of steels and irons involves heating a material to a temperature above its austenitizing temperature, which converts the material structure to austenite. After the material has been fully transformed to austenite, it is rapidly quenched to transform the material structure to martensite which increases the hardness and strength of the material to its highest possible level. After quenching, the material is tempered down to the desired final hardness and strength level by re-heating to a lower sub-critical temperature which serves to substantially increase ductility and toughness as the hardness and strength are gradually reduced.
Neutral hardening is performed in a neutral atmosphere where there is no net gain or loss of carbon, nitrogen or other elements to the material’s surface. This is typically used for finished or near-finished parts where decarburization of the surface is not allowed.
Open fire hardening is performed in air atmosphere furnaces where carbon can exit the material’s surface by reacting with air causing surface decarburization to occur. This is often performed on raw materials or rough parts where all surfaces will be ground or machined after hardening, which will remove the decarburized surface layer.
This process is also commonly referred to as quench and temper, harden and temper, and through hardening.
Hardened stainless steel used in fields of application, where high demands are placed on corrosion resistance and wear protection. We produce a surface which is up to 5 times harder and moves the operating limits of the previously soft steel.
The areas of application are varied and comprise the consumer goods and household goods sector, mechanical engineering and construction, medical technology, automotive and components industry.
Several different methods and types of equipment can be selected for neutral hardening. The processing parameters, atmospheres used, and particular furnace type is chosen based on the particular steel or iron grade requiring hardening and if the quantity of parts to be treated is an individual piece, small lot, or a high volume production order.

New status update. The JE pistons arrived two weeks ago and we made the final plateau honing with the finest stone and the by JE prescribed cross hatch angle. Since the cylinders weren't damaged and the ovality + conicality was within the reach for the hone, we decided to not bore up to the next cylinder size (84,2), but spent the money on custom diameter pistons instad. Interesting fact is that cylinder 3 & 4 were 2 hundreds of a mm larger than cylinder 1 & 2. A bit annoying when you order pistons. From factory you have A, B, C, D and E size class to choose between, but aftermarket pistons come in tighter tolerances supposed to be the same for all four cylinders.
Made a quick stop at the workshop on my way home today. Enthusiastic after having borrowed a special tool to extract the flat pin females from the JPT contacts used for the injector wires and most sensors as well. Suddenly I managed to replace almost all the dried out rubber seals used on most cables under the hood. Next things on this topic are to order the seals for the two 7-pin ignition module contacts, which are ridiculously expensive, and to find out what kind of tool the brown IAT sensor contact wants to see to extract its pins. Really annoying that it is just almost the same as the other ones...
I also attach a picture showing the engine block after may dad special ordered that grey tone the block appeared to have. Either the coverage of the original paint was terribly poor (yes it was), or the grey color we got was much lighter (yes, maybe little).

This year the band featured incredible the Robert Washington on lead vocals, Duke Bardwell (bass), Bobby Wood (piano), Jerome ‘Stump’ Monroe (drums), Chris Casello (guitar) and the gorgeous Sue Moreno on vocals.
Arjan Deelen produced and managed the tour. In this interesting spotlight he looks back at power and magic that an ELVIS show can create - plus all the emotions and the highs that being on the road with an Elvis band can bring ...
"A live concert is exciting to me because of all the electricity that is generated in the crowd and on stage. It's my favorite part of the business - live concerts."
Another year, another tour. Was it worth it? You bet! From humble beginnings in ‘08/’09, the ‘Original Elvis Tribute’ has become one of the leading Elvis tribute shows worldwide. Attendances were once again surprisingly good, the crowds were thrilled, there were great reviews even in the mainstream media, and the fans really seem to connect with the show and the musicians that are a part of it – for this tour, the show consisted of: Robert Washington (vocals), Duke Bardwell (bass), Bobby Wood (piano), Jerome ‘Stump’ Monroe (drums), Chris Casello (guitar) and the gorgeous Sue Moreno on vocals.
It’s also a great compliment to see that the show really seems to have made an impact on other similar shows as organized by European fanclubs. Before we came along, most of them seemed satisfied to book the same acts doing the same old show year in, year out. It’s therefore good to see that they are finally trying to come up with different ideas, like request box type shows. When I started doing this, I felt very strongly that the fans would get tired of seeing the same show again and again, and that’s why we try to give the audiences a different take on the Elvis phenomenon, a.o. by including the lesser-known songs.
To create the same level of excitement, we have to be better every year. And that’s a tough challenge to live up to. This year we decided to add some extra muscle to the band by way of Jerome ‘Stump’ Monroe, Sweet Inspirations drummer and replacement drummer for Elvis on a number of occasions, as well as session man extraordinaire Bobby Wood, the keyboard player who was such an integral part of those legendary Memphis ’69 sessions. And right from the get-go, they belonged.
It was particularly cool to see Duke Bardwell and Stump reunite after 35+ years. They were often reminiscing about the Elvis days, and it was fun to hear so many stories which have never made it into print.
One story that I thought was pretty cool was Stump remembering Elvis barging into the Sweet Inspirations dressing room one night, looking for Sylvia. Apparently she had some financial difficulties at the time, and Elvis wanted to help her out.
Stump says that Elvis came in together with his entire entourage, just as he (Stump) was enjoying a big joint. The whole room was filled with the smell of marijuana, and Stump still remembers the fear that he felt at that point: “I thought my ass was fired!”. But Elvis just laughed and said: “Don’t worry about it, Stump. You can take care of yourself”.
There was another reunion in store for us, because in Oslo the band met up with Ed Bonja. Stump and Duke were genuinely happy to see him again, and Ed also really seemed to enjoy talking to them again after so many years. Ed saw the Oslo concert that night, and he was really impressed with the show. A week later he wrote: “The show was absolutely fantastic, and those guys can play with anyone. Robert has a fantastic voice, and I'm so happy I finally got to hear him in person. Also, the song selection was so well thought out and completely enjoyable. Congratulations on a great tour!”.
Sonny West was there as well, and he was also very impressed with the show. He told us: “I really enjoyed the show. When Robert did ‘Trying To Get To You’, it reminded me of those times in the 60s at home when Elvis would sing for us. I would always ask for that one. Robert sang it just like Elvis – amazing”.
Someone who really made an impact on the whole band was Bobby Wood. With his easygoing personality and his great musicality, it was easy to see why Elvis had so much respect for him (Bobby remembers with pride that while listening to the playback of ‘I’ve Got A Thing About You Baby’, Elvis observed that Bobby was “one of the most commercial piano players that I’ve ever heard”).
On the tour, Bobby quickly became the ‘go-to guy’ whenever someone wanted to discuss the arrangement of a song. Nevertheless, I sensed some reluctance on his part when I asked him to sing ‘If I’m A Fool (For Loving You)’.
As some of you probably know, Bobby originally had a hit with this song in ’64, and Elvis recorded the song in ’69 as a nod to him. He told me that it had been years since he last sang on stage, but he finally agreed that he would do it. And of course the audiences loved it.
Here’s Bobby singing that song, plus a few more Memphis ’69 songs (check out Bobby jumping up & down during “Suspicious Minds”!):
One night early on in the tour, Duke, Stump and I were talking about the people from Elvis’ band that had died recently, like Myrna Smith and Sherrill Nielsen. Duke remarked on how sad it was to see all these wonderful, talented people leave us.
Stump also expressed his deep sadness about their deaths. He said that he loved working with Myrna, and that she was a great upbeat person who always had a smile for everybody. Stump also remembered Sherrill with great fondness, and said that he had seen him in Vegas not so long ago.
Both Duke and Stump observed that the shows with Elvis seemed like only yesterday, so it was really difficult for them to accept the deaths of these very special people… J.D. Sumner, Myrna Smith, Sylvia Shemwell, Sherrill Nielsen…
I asked Duke whether he would like to sing ‘Peace In The Valley’ on the shows. Somehow it seemed appropriate. Duke embraced the idea, and his soulful version of this old spiritual became one of the highlights of the shows:
As good as the original guys are, I think it’s safe to say that the Number One Attraction in the band is Robert Washington. Not only is he a charismatic, vibrant performer who really knows how to wow a crowd, but he also has some remarkable pipes. In fact, vocally he is easily the best Elvis performer around today.
On this tour, he once again blew everybody away with his vocal tour-de-forces on songs like ‘How Great Thou Art’ and ‘Without Love’, he seduced them with beautiful ballads like ‘Young & Beautiful’, took them on a night out on Beale Street with raunchy blues stuff like ‘Power Of My Love’ and ‘It Feels So Right’ and made them dance the night away with the rock & roll of ‘Burning Love’ and ‘Hound Dog’. It was a joy to watch him dazzle audiences night after night.
Robert is the only performer in the Elvis scene where you see the audiences going completely apeshit like this. The reactions to him where very real, almost primal, even in countries that are traditionally a bit reserved, like Norway. It was also not unusual to see people cry during songs like ‘How Great Thou Art’. It was very powerful (and sometimes very emotional) to be a part of it all. Stump summed it up best when he said: “If Elvis were alive today, he would have loved the show. He would have told us: ‘Good job, guys’”.
‘The Original Elvis Tribute’ will be back in April 2012, and we want to make this tour even more special than the previous ones. Duke Bardwell, Bobby Wood, Robert Washington and Jerome ‘Stump’ Monroe have already confirmed that they would love to do it again. We also have a very special surprise for the next tour, as we will be bringing Ginger and Mary Holladay over to Europe for the first time ever.
The Holladay sisters were amongst the leading female backing vocalists in the 60s and 70s, and their powerful voices are featured on countless hits & classics. Elvis loved their voices, and he always made sure that Felton would use the Holladays for his recording sessions. Ginger and Mary can be heard on hit-singles like ‘Suspicious Minds’, ‘In The Ghetto’, ‘The Wonder Of You’ and ‘You Don’t Have To Say You Love Me’, as well as on numerous EP albums like ‘From Elvis In Memphis’, ‘Back In Memphis’, ‘That’s The Way It Is’, ‘Elvis Country’, ‘Love Letters From Elvis’, ‘Elvis Now’, the Grammy award-winning ‘He Touched Me’, ‘Fool’, ‘Raised On Rock’, ‘Good Times’, ‘Promised Land’ and ‘Today’. Their voices were even overdubbed on live-recordings like the ‘On Stage’ album.
Ginger Holladay is also one of the very few people who actually got to record a live duet with Elvis in the studio: On March 15, 1971, they recorded ‘The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face’ at RCA’s studio B in Nashville. She remembers that she was quite nervous about doing the duet with Elvis, and that she had to stand on a crate to be eye-to-eye with him. “Elvis was really getting into the lyrics of the song, and he was being very romantic with me. I was only 18 at the time, and I felt intimidated by him. He would try to hug and kiss me, and I’d pull back. Of course, now I regret not kissing him when I had the chance!”. *
The Holladays have lots of great stories to tell about their association with Elvis, so the European fans really have something to look forward to. And, these women can really sing. Bobby Wood told me that they sound exactly like on the original recordings. So our upcoming April 2012 shows will mark the first time ever in Europe that the original backing vocals to such classics as “Suspicious Minds” and “In the Ghetto” are being reproduced live in concert. This in itself will make the shows an unforgettable experience, but we have a lot more surprises planned for 2012 (which incidentally marks the 35th anniversary of Elvis’ death).

We have seen both Original Elvis Tribute shows here in Vaasa. Elvis and his music has filled our life for a long time. we love him so much. These shows brought Elvis so close to us. Thanks to the wonderful singer Robert Washington . His voice is so close to Elvis, you close your eyes and you can just feel him. The whole band was amazing and best of all they were charming, lovely, people with a big heart. They took also beautifully care of our son Daniel (13) who is a big Elvis fanatic from age of 6 and keeps on Elvis legacy here by singing and playing his songs. He will never ever forget the kindness of these peoples. Specially Duke Bardwell. He had time to speak a lot with him and Daniel got even to play with the band.. Great memories. And special thanks for the best manager Arjan Deelen who made this all possible. You are just great. There is still one special thing in this show. It was really a tribute to Elvis without any "Elvis clothes". No plastic and thats why i think Robert Washington really could make us to feel that Elvis was there. he sang from all his heart.
"The Original Elvis Tribute Show". First time I worked with Duke, Michael and rest band during unforgettable show in Cracow in May 2009. In was special time for us, polish fans. First time when member of Elvis' TCB Band coming to Poland. Fans was very exciting this. One year later, in 2010 "The Original Elvis Tribute Show" back to Poland. This time on two phenomenal show. First on CK Zamek in Poznań. It was my second meeting with Duke Bardwell, Michael Jarrett and first time with Sue Moreno, Chris Casello and Robert Washington (WOW, what a voice!). Next show band play on Ruda Śląska. This concert was recording for special DVD project (and probably it will published on next year!).
When people sometimes ask me, "what is Your favourite Elvis' song?" I answer "I don't have favorite Elvis' song. I love one Elvis' recording session - American Sound Studio 1969". "The Original Elvis Tribute Show 2011" was dream come true (for me)!Phenomenal performance of hits from '69 sessions like "Any Day Now" or "Wearin' That Loved On Look".And when I heard Robert singing "How Great Thou Art" i think: "I don't believed that someone can sing 'How Great Thou Art' like Elvis. Robert doing it!". Thank You for all and I hope see You next year!
I have seen this Orginal Elvis tribute show 2 times, 2010 and 2011 in Vaasa Finland. I have been a big fan of Elvis Presley from when i was just a little girl. And this show is just the best! All the people on the show are in credible professional mucisians and plays the songs so good!! The singer in the show Robert Washington is so charismatig peformer and his sigingn voice sounds so close like Elvis, you just close your eys and you feel like Elvis Presley him self is singing to you!! And beautiful singer Sue Moreno brings the great style of 1950s to the show whith her great voice and present beside Robert is fabulous!!! I must say this too, that all the great people on the show are just the nicest easy to go chat with after the show!! And i cant wait them to come back next year 2012!!!! :)
I am a big Elvis fan from Finland. In my opinion, The Original Elvis Tribute was a brilliant show - I've seen it every time it has been in my
country! What I liked most about it was the authenticity of the show with all the skillful original Elvis musicians playing a very wide range of Elvis
songs - not only the biggest hits as in most other Elvis productions. It was entertaining, fun and really offered something for everybody. There weren't any fancy jumpsuits, scarves and hipshaking, but it was rather a true tribute to Elvis and his music. 100% rock'n'roll nostalgia!
Like to tell a little bit of the show in Ritz, Vaasa 3rd May, 2011 (couldn´t attend the 4th May concert, which I heard was really good too...)
Great show, great performances. Really nice, that Bobby Wood joined the band, and Jerome Stump. Wood sang also beautifully, "IF I´m a fool for loving you". Before it he told a story of the session in American Studios in 1969! Also about this song. Robert Washington had amzing voice. And he gave it all! Once again.....Casello played soo good, a real virtuose! Fun tuo watch! Beuatiful Su Moreno is a real jem! Singing beautifully! Stylish! Drummer Jerome Stump - played as other members did...wonderfully! And leader of the band, Duke Bardwell sang also Peace in the Valley! He can both play and sing!
The Original Elvis Tribute is an interesting combination of musicians from different eras of Elvis career. Duke Bardwell, Bobby Wood & Stump Monroe worked well on stage. One of the interesting thing is a setlist which is surely challenging the listerner: lots of interestings and some rarely heard tracks. One of the best parts of the show is the gospel sequence. While listening How Great Thou Art and closing your eyes you could almost feel like The Man Himself is on stage. Singer Robert Washington is an excellent performer and he's sounding quite close to Elvis. And he surely knows how to take audience. Really enjoyable concert.
I was the MC for the German show, the last one of the European tour in May this year. That was a really great performance with artists like:
Bobby Wood, the very good musician, who of course sang his hit from 1964 – If I’m A Fool For Loving You
Duke Bardwell, a really funny guy, that surprised us all with his singing of „Peace In The Valley“ with a voice like Ray Walker oder J. D. Sumner.
Stumps Monroe, who played three shows with Elvis as a drummer in the 70s. All other shows he played before Elvis with the Sweet Inspirations or Imperials. So he knew all Elvis arrangements.Also we had the great guitarist Chirs Casello, the lovely female singer Sue Moreno and the marvelous singer Bobby Washington, that is a black guy, but looks Hawaiian Style. He has a perfect body and also a perfect voice, that can sing Elvis-songs of the 50s, 60 and 70s.
The Elvis Information Network has been running since 1986 and is an EPE officially recognised Elvis fan club.
NO FOLKS, the new one from Presley just isn’t the sensational come-back disc that everyone hoped it might be. But on the other hand it’s certainly not a bad disc like was “One Broken Heart For Sale.” Falling somewhere in between the two it’s a jaunty beat-ballad with the tempo changing back and forth throughout the disc to confuse all dancers. Pretty melody, good vocals from El, but a rather feeble attempt at putting the beat into the backing in places, that just doesn’t come off. Should be a hit – but we doubt a top spot. Most unusual for Mr. Presley really.
Flip is another beat ballad, a tired-sounding number with Elvis working overtime for the effect. Seems like everyone is getting fed up with the song by the end. We were certainly.
Gratitude and honor are remarkable character traits that I’ve always searched for in my fellow humans. Imagine my pleasant surprise when I found them in a millennial! It was not a millennial born and raised in this country but in Romania, in the beautiful Apuseni Mountains of western Transylvania.
In Rosia Montana, the county of Alba, Tica Darie, a 25-year old entrepreneur, saw locally produced merino wool and artisan knitting skills as a source of golden opportunity, fleeced from the flock of merino sheep and turned into socks, sweaters, scarves, and other accessories that the fashionably young and other customers could wear. The label is Made in Rosia Montana.
Rosia Montana is the same village that was embroiled in a bitter battle in 2013 between western developers who wanted to dynamite four mountains and flood the village and its waters with cyanide in order to extract the rich vines of gold, the miners who wanted such development, and the rest of the village who wanted to preserve their beautiful area, unspoiled by gold mining. The young entrepreneur, Tica Darie, was caught in the middle and suffered at times physical and verbal threats and the wrath of the miners.
Darie realized that people were being forced to sell their ancestral lands and, in some cases, expropriated from their homes by the government eager to cash in on the western gold development “bonanza.”
Darie felt compelled to help the locals who wanted to save their village. He ran marathons and participated in bike tours across Europe to Rosia Montana, in order to draw attention to the plight of the villagers. He even biked 2533 km from Copenhagen to Rosia Montana, carrying the Romanian flag.
Applying the skills he learned in Denmark in multi-media design, Darie made videos and developed sites for his own online store. Ever the optimist, the future looks bright for this young entrepreneur. He moved to Rosia Montana four years ago and, in the meantime became a father to a beautiful little girl and bought a property for his shop which he is going to restore.
“You have to become a responsible citizen, no matter where you live,” said Darie. There are now signs permanently attached to the front of homes stating, “This property is not for sale.” http://recorder.ro/antreprenoriatul-salveaza-rosia-montana/
In the battle between those seeking gold in the veins of the mountain and those who wanted to remain in their own beds and their own homes, surrounded by beautiful and pristine mountains, peace has settled over the poor village for now. When Darie becomes successful in his enterprise, fifty or more families will have a chance to make a living with dignity and suitable pay, not slave wages.
Rosia Montana has lost half of its population since the Revolution of 1989 when communism “fell.” There are ruins everywhere for sure, some from the communist era, others homes bought by the Gold Corporation and left to sink into the ground, and even houses abandoned by their former owners who were bought out and now these ruins are inhabited by rats. But there are homes left that are maintained with pride by their owners.
The entire village had been slated to become a decanting lake for the Gold Corporation. The gas station, post office, the bank, mobile phone office and few but scarce amenities are scattered here and there. Generations across centuries guarded their pastoral lifestyle with pride.
It is certainly not an easy place to start a business but the perennial optimist Darie is undaunted and hopes to succeed with Made in Rosia Montana for the sake of his adopted home. It will take a millennial with determination, gratitude and honor like Darie to make it happen. http://bit.ly/2z3P4bY

I think we should have let them. Capitalism. A lot of money for our budget. Same as with Pungesti. What good our resources if we don t valorify it?
We boil up coffee the old way I suppose, we have a metal pot, we put water in it put coffee in it, heat till it boils yada yada.
We put in about 3 scoops. But recently we found a coffee grinder that 1 scoop of coffee (Remember this isn't that instant stuff it's coffee grounds) makes like half a cup. I'm trying to figure out how much Caffeine is in it, it's much stronger tasting than a normal cup.
I tried to look it up, but it was unclear. They said about 60mg a scoop, but that was instant coffee. And I figured, using example numbers.
If 3 scoops of Coffee was say 200mg of caffine, would that be 30ish mg per cup, or would it be 200 mg per cup. I just can't figure out how coffee works X_X
Also if 3 scoops of coffee has 200mg of caffeine and you are making 1 1/2 cups of coffee from it then 1 cup of coffee has 133mg of caffeine. (since you said 1 scoop makes about 1/2 cup and 3 scoops=200mg...i have used this info as an example)
what beans you use, how they were/are roasted, how coffee was ground, how long and at what temperature it was brewed...caffeine content will vary on these factors. so, even if 3 scoops=200mg but if its heated on high temperature for too long then it will be strong but low in caffeine. it wont be 200mg for 3 scoops anymore.
I am also a coffee drinker so i love to drink a cup of coffee. Coffee has so many health benefits so i would like to thank you all for sharing wonderful information.
Thanks for sharing this information, actually I'm living in aged home and the doctor here suggest me to drink the least amount of coffee, it's just like an addiction to me I want to ask you guys how many mg of caffeine we can take in a day?

Creationist bloggers can be infuriating. If one has infuriated you by persisting in nonsense even when corrected, or refusing to reply to your criiticsm, you may feel driven to recording the fact. If so, you may register your disapproval here and hope a response is forthcoming.
The meat machine known as Ken Ham wrote a blog post. It was not a scientific article nor did Ham pretend that it was so. The meat machine known as Ashley Haworth-Roberts fallaciously criticized it and used a generalization against Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis. Let Ashley Haworth-Roberts criticize and show where the science is erroneous in this article since he pretends to be an expert in so many fields. https://answersingenesis.org/biology/mi ... d-eukarya/

Ham was discussing scientific topics. "Let Ashley Haworth-Roberts criticize and show where the science is erroneous in this article". I already did with respect to Ham's blog post, troll. Why are you now moving the goalposts. If you want to discuss another AiG article I never mentioned - go ahead. You have the floor.

"Genesis is not only true history, but is the foundation for all Christian doctrine--for a truly Christian worldview. Genesis also teaches on gender (sex can't be changed), marriage (one man for one woman), and climate change (it won't destroy the world)."
Genesis teaches NOTHING about whether humans can unintentionally or deliberately alter the climate. Ken Ham is being untruthful about a so-called Genesis doctrine (any climate change doctrine there is at Genesis 8:22). And scientists are NOT claiming that current climate change will 'destroy the world'. But - if the cause of climate change/global warming (which does not stop some bitter early 2018 cold in large parts of the northern hemisphere) - is not tackled this verse could potentially be somewhat falsified if heatwaves and/or intense droughts destroy crops. Ken Ham's 'logic' - if it isn't destroying the world then it's either 'no problem' or 'fictional'.
It makes the same foolish and simplistic claim (YECs also insist there was an 'ice age' after the Genesis flood even though that is totally NOT in the Bible and would have made harvests very difficult in much of the world):
"Or consider climate change/global warming: if God told Noah after the Flood He would never destroy the earth again with water, and that the seasons (i.e., the climate) would remain the same for seedtime and harvest, then there's no need to fear any future climate catastrophe."
How does he know that this means humans should do NOTHING to halt recent climate change (or that the climate change is 'natural')?
I have hardly ever, if at all, previously seen Ken Ham quote or allude to Genesis 8:22. Probably because he is pushing a 'recent' 'post-flood' (and fictional and unbiblical) 'ice age'.
Yet when he wants to deny the real problem of current man-made climate change he is happy to make the claim (echoing another YEC) that current climate change won't (unlike a global flood) 'destroy the earth' - because God promised (at Genesis 8:21) not to destroy the earth again.
"We are only beginning to learn about some of the mechanisms that drive minor climate change, but the Lord promised in Genesis 9:15 that He will not again judge the world by a global Flood. He also said in Genesis 8:22, “While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, winter and summer, and day and night shall not cease.” That means we shouldn’t be worried about run-away global warming or another Ice Age."
Yet AiG - and this includes Vardiman himself - falsely claim that the Genesis flood WAS followed by an 'ice age' even after God made his promise at Genesis 8:21-22. So the verse is true NOW but was PREVIOUSLY false, Dr Vardiman?
Yet earlier in the SAME article she falsely claims: "...However, this climate was radically changed when the surface of Earth was destroyed, reshaped, and rearranged by the global Flood of Noah’s day around 4,300 years ago. As the earth was settling from the Flood, there was a transitional climate which included an Ice Age that covered 30% of the earth’s surface in ice. This transitional climate slowly gave way to the present climate as the earth evened out from the after effects of the Flood. Therefore, starting with a biblical model for Earth’s history, we should expect variations in climate and temperature."
"Just another example of the evolving story of evolution. Almost daily evolutionists are changing their ideas--after all, it's just a made-up story about the past so they can change it whenever they want--and they do--and they call it science!
What an appalling pathologically lying cultist science hating bigot this man is. Makes me feel sick in the stomach - if I was still a Christian I am sure I would feel exactly the same.
Details of a wide-ranging theory get altered following further investigations. Which is what happens sometimes with science.
"I urge Christians to become more vocal regarding calling evolution and millions of years what they really are (and to undo secularist brainwashing). Evolution and millions of years—concepts held to with ardor and blind faith—are a religion—and this religion is being imposed on kids. Secularist propaganda has brainwashed millions of kids in evolution, but it's an anti-God religion to justify people being their own gods!"
No the person with the unchanging inflexible dogmatic RELIGION is Ken Ham. The theory of evolution is NOT an unchanging inflexible dogmatic 'religion'. A typical dictionary definition of religion being "the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods" or "a particular system of faith and worship".
He's an appalling hypocrite. "I love science!" No - you hate science. You FALSELY call it a 'religion' - and then FALSELY allege that it is being significantly changed 'almost daily'. Ken Ham is a LIAR.
The fascist really means that science does not always agree with his religious beliefs and carries on falsifying a 'young' universe.
(I saw this piece of bigotry - see the comments about climate change, he knows better than almost all the meteorologists and climatologists on the planet - just after flagging the previous post by email.)
"Ironically, the Bible describes the earth as round and hanging in space—long before this could have been directly observed (Job 26:10; Isaiah 40:22). The appeal of this claim is that it stereotypes creationists as stuck in the past, since the common assumption is that people once universally believed the earth was flat before science “proved” otherwise (which wasn’t the case—only a few bought into the idea that the earth was flat)...".
And there are other Bible verses which imply that Earth is flat. Verses not mentioned in this article - such as Matthew 4:8. And it's easier to perceive a flat circular disk having 'four corners' than it is to perceive a three dimensional globe having such.
And there is a growing 'Flat Earth' movement in 2018 - and some of the believers are Christians who also fervently believe the Bible (though probably most fundamentalist Christians aren't flat earthers):
"another verse that indicates the spherical nature of our planet is Job 26:10". No it doesn't liar Lisle (who is being quoted in the new article and used to work for AiG). In the version you link to it reads: "He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness". This could easily be referring to a TWO dimensional circle. And Lisle's claim "Job 26:10 suggests a “God’s eye” view of the earth" is nonsensical - God would not see a circle on waters where the sun was rising/setting on Earth's surface. He would see waters on a 'circle' (or a semi-circle if looking at one 'side' of Earth only from far enough away that the planet appears as a globe).
Though I accept Lisle's argument: "This biblical passage would be nonsense if the earth were flat, since there would be no true terminator" (the Job 26 verse does imply a terminator on Earth's surface). However: "there is no line to “step over” that separates the day from night on a flat surface". Why not? That is not addressed. Perhaps the Sun goes 'underneath' a flat Earth during night?
"It [evolution] cannot be tested by the scientific method. Therefore, those who doubt it are not anti-science." Yes they are - and AiG are pro-religion and anti-science. Evolution could be falsified. It hasn't been. But I agree that evolution requires more 'faith' than a globe Earth.
"A recent article highlighted the discovery of a “duck-relative” (otherwise known as a duck) [no], which they call a “modern bird,” [yes ie it was not toothed unlike most from the Cretaceous era] from the supposed “Age of Dinosaurs,” [no 'supposed' just actual] according to the evolutionary timeline.
"This duck group supposedly survived the dinosaur extinction event some 65 million years ago and is allegedly “the first documented case of a group of birds surviving such extinction.”" [That's what the evidence shows.] "But how could dinosaurs have evolved into birds if we have examples of modern birds in the very same layers as dinosaurs?" [Easily since there were hundreds of species of dinosaurs - though not all of them contemporaneous with each other - through an era lasting more than 150 million years, and (as AiG accept) some birds, species that are now long extinct, were already around too towards the end of that era.] Ham's bold type sentence is wilful misdirection.
This article also repeats Ken Ham 'information' from earlier this month that has recently been mostly debunked by a Christian palaeontologist blogger. Namely: "And, contrary to what the article states, these ducks are certainly not the only example [that article never said they were it said neornithes were "very scarce and patchy" and then suggested that Vegaviidae was "the first group of modern birds from the Mesozoic" (to survive the extinction event - and note the word 'group')] of modern birds buried with dinosaurs. We find fossilized parrots, albatrosses, loons, owls, flamingos, penguins, sandpipers, and more buried in the same layers as dinosaurs. And one evolutionary researcher claimed that such evidence supports the idea that “most or all of the major modern bird groups were present in the Cretaceous” (a so-called “dinosaur layer”). While these fossils are rarely displayed in museums, they exist and are a serious challenge to the evolutionary timeline."
"But the author of the article calls these birds “bird-like dinosaurs” because of the supposed evolutionary connection between dinosaurs and birds (even though modern and now-extinct birds lived at the same time as the dinosaurs, including parrots, loons, owls, flamingos, and more)."
"But this claim is just wrong and it is wrong in multiple ways. First, for most of the birds mentioned, no such fossils exist. Second, the term “modern” is undefined but 99% of AiG’s readers will take this to mean that a “modern” parrot from the era of dinosaurs is a parrot similar to one alive today but whose bones are found mixed with dinosaur-bearing rocks.
So, are there fossils of “modern” parrots, loons, owls and flamingos found in dinosaur-era rocks? The short answer – NO! But are there fossils in dinosaur-bearing rocks of ancestral parrots and flamingos that are recognizable as belonging to those families or “kinds” as Ken Ham might want to call them or may be thinking in his “modern” term? The answer is still NO! There aren’t even any fossils that can be definitely identified as belonging to these families that are found with dinosaurs." [However Ken Ham does appear to have shown in his latest blog post that there were some ancestral parrots around in the Cretaceous.]
A "serious challenge to the evolutionary timeline" is not the same thing as a serious challenge to the theory of evolution.
"The layers don’t represent eons of evolutionary time—they most likely represent ecosystems successively buried by rising floodwaters." Total garbage. How could more than one ecosystem be found in a single location in the space of one year (a 'flood year' indeed)? Total nonsense. Real science - and real deep time - does explain what is observed.
"To learn more about fossils of so-called “modern” animals, check out Living Fossils, an excellent book by Dr. Carl Werner. You’ll be shocked by what’s found in the fossil record that you never knew about!
Actually these Vegaviidae birds may have been more loons than ducks. Remind you of anyone? From the article Ham tries to ridicule:
"Records of Modern birds (Neornithes) from the Age of Dinosaurs or Mesozoic Era, are very scarce and patchy. Most specimens are represented by isolated bones or strongly incomplete skeletons. This contrast with toothed birds, which are widely represented and known by abundant skeletons." Toothed birds, which appeared earlier in Earth history, having now gone extinct. We are left with 'modern' birds (even if some of them had ancient origins).
"Well, you certainly know such fossils weren't formed slowly over millions of years! Whatever preserved such fossils was catastrophic--consistent with what we'd expect from a catastrophic global Flood."
This fossil arthropod was found within the Chengjiang fauna in China - which is part of the Maotianshan Shale.
Ham is an anti-science pathologically lying fanatic who does not care that Christians are fed lies so long as they 'accept the authority of the whole Bible from the very first verse'.
I would post the link to this response at Ham's Facebook page. Except that someone working for this fraud has cravenly blocked me from posting there (so I will email the post to them via their website).
The rabble who follow Ham are even worse than he is. Look at all the bigoted idiotic and arrogant comments made under his latest Facebook lie.
Ken Ham is fighting against material reality - whereas those other 'compromising' evangelical Christians aren't (but Ham thinks Bible verses, even those that are not direct teaching, are the ultimate 'reality' - from God).
"Terry, Andrew, and typically an Old Testament professor show them the overwhelming geological evidence for the Flood and a young earth." There isn't any such thing. That is why so many Christians and others are suspicious of Ken Ham. He is a bigot.
Why do you suppose there are three other views of 'creation' amongst Christians Mr Ham? Are all these people deluded, divisive and insane and being used by the devil to destroy the Bible and Christianity?
One reviewer of that 2017 book states: "Ken Ham then goes on to state that “The scientific evidence confirming the literal truth [i.e., his interpretation] of Genesis 1-11 is overwhelming and increasing with time as a result of the research of both evolutionists and creationists” (p. 31). That statement is blatantly false and totally opposite of reality."
Another reviewer, referring to YEC, states that Ham's claim is that "it is not a salvation issue, but that it IS a gospel issue, in fairly strong language, accusing those who deny YEC of undermining the foundation of the gospel".
Whenever I try to view CMI's home page this evening I get a privacy error message beginning "Your connection is not private ...".
But I can get to the homepage, and then the latest article, by accessing the site via an old CMI article as flagged on their Facebook page:
https://creation.com/darwin-pigeons (Yet another attack on Darwin which uses pseudo-science to make its argument eg "Darwin’s work actually demonstrates how the intense selection pressures after the Flood could have acted on gene pools rich in variety to allow rapid speciation/adaptive radiation from the restricted number of land-dwelling kinds represented on the Ark. The variability built into each created kind thus allowed post-Flood populations to respond to changing environmental pressures (adapt) and thus conserve the kinds".)
"... According to the state of knowledge at the time, the genetic analysis did suggest that Cheddar Man’s skin was dark. But science progresses, and since the analysis was done last year, many more genes affecting skin colour have been discovered. Understandably, the new science did not make it into the documentary.
To add insult to injury, the story has now been seized upon by alt-right activists on social media...".
So what have AiG got to say about 'Cheddar Man'? Not much on 'Answers News' - other than complaining about scientists publishing stuff in a press release prior to peer reviewing it (and then back-pedalling slightly). Of course creationists would not publish stuff on their websites that has not been peer reviewed and accepted by the scientific community - would they?
In the blog post, Ham says: "But it’s a reminder that we need to be careful about believing what we read, especially if it contradicts God’s Word (such as the 10,000-year age assigned to “Cheddar Man”—sadly much of the media has been brainwashing the public in many false ideas about origins, especially when it comes to the dates!). We can be confident that research, when done right and interpreted correctly, will always confirm God’s Word." Of course he does NOT want Christians to be 'careful' in the same way about believing the stuff that appears on the Answers in Genesis website (and research 'always' confirming God's Word is a sham not science).
Or indeed the stuff by Ham within this book 'Four Views on Creation, Evolution, and Intelligent Design' - where Ham's sciencey claims appear alongside those by other Christians who strongly disagree with young earth creationism:
PS In that book, theistic evolutionist/evolutionary creationist Deborah Haarsma wrote about the pattern of the (ancient) fossil record:"The species are not mixed together as expected from the violence of a global flood. Rather, rock formations like the Grand Canyon show discrete layers ...". But in his rejoinder the fanatic Ham simply repeated yet again his false claim: "Noah's Flood produced most of the geological evidence that evolutionists attribute to millions of years". (Apparently Haarsma 'must' be wrong because she doesn't believe there was a 'global' flood. Probably because of eg what is seen at the Grand Canyon liar Ken Ham - fossils, including of long-extinct creatures, in distinct layers. With very old dates.)
"No, it has NOT "been established as scientific fact that birds evolved from a group of dinosaurs"--that's a lie. Archaeopteryx was fully bird! But, some evolutionists falsely claims it's a transitional form and then say dinosaurs flew! It's a fairy tale presented as fact:
The science opposing bigot tells his cult members that it was 'fully bird' and not a dinosaur (which is how real scientists with no axe to grind now classify it) - and even though a dinosaur that could fly is certainly in no way 'unbiblical'.
And the bigoted extremists who follow Ham (some other people also follow him) just love it and round upon any critics of the bigot. For instance:
"SO, you demand the research, the research is offered to you and without viewing what you demanded, you disdainfully push it away. Either you have political motivations or you are a afraid God exists. A coward indeed."
The real cowards are the Bible fanatics and science haters at AiG. They censor people who 'rock the boat'. People like me.
OK, so my Trek Madone 4.5 WSD is only 7 months old. I bought it in April. It's my first road bike and I am new to cycling again since I was a kid. It has the Shimano 105 group and I REALLY wanted SRAM. Is it stupid to already switch it out to a SRAM group set? I mean the WHOLE thing - shifters, brakes, chain all of it. SRAM Force or Rival? I am not interested in Apex. Thoughts? Opinions?
My first question would be, "Why do you want to switch out the drive components?" Is it based on what some other cyclist told you or have you personally had several bad experiences with Shimano? Personally, unless the cassette and chain rings wear out to the point they need replacing, I would just leave what you have on the bike. Unfortunately, questions that are answered on these forums are mostly biased and based on what bike or equipment the responder has and not so much on what they think you should do. I don't know how much riding you have done in the 7 months that you have had the bike, but it doesn't make any sense to upgrade the entire drivetrain on a new bike. Did you ask the shop where you bought the bike if they would swap out the components when you purchased it?
My road bike came with all Tiagra components except for the shifter/brake group, which were Sora. The first thing I wanted to do was the change them to Tiagra so all the drivetrain components would match. I've had the bike for a year (3,100 miles) now and have gotten so used to the Sora shifters, that I really don't see any reason for changing them, unless they wear out or break.

Personally, unless the cassette and chain rings wear out to the point they need replacing, I would just leave what you have on the bike. Unfortunately, questions that are answered on these forums are mostly biased and based on what bike or equipment the responder has and not so much on what they think you should do. I don't know how much riding you have done in the 7 months that you have had the bike, but it doesn't make any sense to upgrade the entire drivetrain on a new bike. Did you ask the shop where you bought the bike if they would swap out the components when you purchased it?
Thanks guys for your responses. I went to another bike shop in my area and talked to the owner and bike mechanic at this place. I have just always hated the brakes on this bike I got and discovered they are Tektro R540 brakes which the mechanic said a lot of riders are not fond of (like I said this is all new for me and am still learning) so I bought the Shimano 105 5700 brakes they will put on for me this weekend. Ultimately, I learned more about SRAM and found out why they are not an upgrade on this bike and if I did upgrade it might be to the Ultegra or Dura-Ace or even possibly the Campagnolo groupset way later down the road , which I would have not even considered before I learned more about it today.
Are you planning on racing or doing time trials with this bike? Unless you are, I still don't understand your reason for upgrading the drivetrain. There is not that much weight difference between the 105 and the Ultegra that would warrant the price. Are you missing shifts or shifting takes too long? If so, that is an adjustment problem and not that of the groupo. Another thing to think about is the resale value of the bike. Upgrading the groupo isn't going to get you much more on a trade in or a resale; certainly not what you paid for it.
OK, I can (sort of) understand about the brakes. Tektro's more entry level stuff is not working as well as the Shimano ones (in the lab). They are good enough, though, and many people don't realise that the 105 equipped bike comes with the 105 rear dérailleur and the shifters and the rest is less expensive (though mostly still working well). I don't know whether this is the case on your bike, I didn't look at the specs.
From a shift / break performance point of view, 105 and Ultegra are almost identical in the lab and I guess you wouldn't feel any difference on the road. Ultegra is about 300g or so lighter and has a slightly nicer finish. This year's Tiagra (one below 105) has also been tested to work very well (the ones before were less good, own experience, they felt... wobbly, inexact, to me) but is heavier. SRAM also makes very nice components, unfortunately the (right) shifters and rear dérailleurs are not compatible to Shimano, the rest probably is (I know chain and cassette are). From a technical point of view, the performance is on par for all three big brands (Campagnolo, Shimano, SRAM) when comparing groupsets in the (roughly) same price ranges. From a personal point of view this is debated hotly, fringing on holy wars. I think that SRAM was offering STIs (or whatever they call their shifters) that could be adjusted for smaller hands and Shimano didn't have that option and Campa has 11spd groupsets and (until recently) only Shimano had electronic shifting, but that's about it. If it is your first road bike you also do not need to learn yet another way of shifting and relearn all motion patterns (shifting does work quite different on all brands), though I do not really find this an issue (recently test rode an SRAM apex equipped bike, I have bike with Shimano 105 and one with Microshift STIs).
Swapping components can be a nice hobby, but it is expensive and won't help you ride faster (well, unless we're talking about much lighter wheels for climbing and sprinting or aerodynamic wheels for time trials).
If I was in your position I would ask myself: Is the 105 really performing so bad, does it have issues that cannot be solved with a good adjustment? (like the problem with the too small hands or a weird shifting logic). I'd rather invest the money in a decent set of wheels or a training week in Spain or Italy (weather in winter is quite bad where I live).
Why is waypoint creation automatic only? I see no documented commands for manual waypoint editing in the readme. Thing with automation is it isnt perfect. I often see bots following the walls or trying to reach something behind it with no success. They often seem to have a hard time finding their way out of some rooms like no waypoint was created in some places and places where there shouldn't be waypoints there's waypoints i.e. bots interested in walking into a death bit. They deviate off what should be their path non stop and get hung up on walls and corners. Waypoint creation needs to have a human touch and I've been given no tools to do so.

Collection of 12 promos by The Smiths, who revitalised guitar music in eighties Britain. Derek Jarman presides over a few of the videos, including 'The Queen Is Dead', a short film featuring the song of the same name, 'There Is a Light That Never Goes Out' and 'Panic'. Lead singer Morrissey had always stated that he believed pop promos were bastardising music in the early 1980s. He obviously changed his mind.

New generation vehicles of the BMW X3 crossover have been spotted in the streets, testing for road capabilities. That implies we are close to its unveiling, even though first plan was to introduce SUV in 2017. New vehicle is equivalent to second-generation crossover. What is going to become new, is performance-tuned 2017 BMW X3 M model, which needs to be launched ahead of regular X3. There is no official information about this car, but because spy photos prove its existence, we are certain that M package for SUV will bring quite a few news and modifications.
Given that the 2017 BMW X3 M is going to be tuned for high performance. That implies far more powertrain selections for it, comparing to regular crossover, which arrives afterwards. One of the possibilities may very well be borrowed from 7 series vehicles of German carmaker. It is 3.0-l 6-cylinder unit. It is going to utilize gasoline as its fuel. Comparable engine is available as diesel motor.
It is made use of by X5 M50d model, and if it is going to become installed in X3 M crossover, we can count on around 370 ponies of output. Nonetheless, most up-to-date rumors are speaking of turbocharged unit which is working with AWD system. Finally this inline powertrain can go as much as 430 hp. If this drivetrain is applied, then 2017 BMW X3 M is going to be one of the greatest performer in its segment.
We realize that new crossover X3 is being tested under the codename G01. Spy shots revealed its look, even under heavy camouflage. Second-generation model may have longer wheelbase, based on what we have seen. The 2017 BMW X3 M version is going to make use of exact same styling, with only interior modification. Comparing to newest X3 SUVs, new vehicle has longer rear doors, rear quarter windows and modified glass house. We could see also larger sunroof and large wheel air curtains. LED lightning needs to be standard. Release date is unknown but, too as cost for both 2017 X3 M model and regular crossover.

On Saturday, June 23 at 8:00 AM, the Holliston Conservation Associates are hosting a bird walk at the Waseeka Audubon Property, led by Donna Cohen.
We have walked this property a number of times over the past several years and it is always a treat. While we cannot guarantee what we will see on this nature walk, in the past we have seen nesting osprey, eastern kingbird, and pileated woodpecker. Many other species were seen or heard including tree swallow, red wing blackbird, grackle, great blue heron, green heron, mourning dove, blue jay, great crested flycatcher, crow, eastern towhee, American robin, black-capped chickadee, goldfinch, ovenbird, song sparrow, common yellowthroat, scarlet tanager, Baltimore oriole, Northern cardinal, eastern wood pewee, and wood duck. Around the pond we have also seen other creatures such as bullfrogs, greenfrogs, painted turtles, and snapping turtles. This time of year, there are blooming flowers and other plants to observe as well.
There is a parking lot among the trees on Mill St. It will be on your right if you come from the golf course end. You have passed the lot if you reach Partridge Rd. in Hopkinton. For more information, call Mary at 429-5929. If it is raining, we will not be walking that day.
The walk is an easy one, perhaps a mile in all, and this property is a gem. Bring binoculars if you have them. We recommend long pants to guard against poison ivy and ticks. We hope you will join us for the first time or again!

It is amazing that there are so many interesting plants by a parking lot that normally do not warrant a second glance!
The Holliston Conservation Associates will be holding a nature walk on Saturday, June 24 at 8 AM along the rail trail
Marc Connelly will lead the walk on the rail trail, pointing out the natural world around us that most of us never see.
Due to the interesting weather this winter and spring, Marc has told us we need to move up the vernal pool walk to April 9th instead of later in the month in order to see the egg masses and other cool things in the pool.

If you can smell something burning when your dryer is running, you need to immediately stop it and have it inspected. Continuing to run your dryer increases the risk of having a fire.
Is your dryer hot to the touch? Are your clothes nearly just as hot? When this happens, it means that your dryer is potentially unable to exhaust that hot air properly. This will wear out your dryer’s heating element and the blower.
When you look at the vent outside, does your dryer have a buildup of lint protruding from it? This is a tell-tale sign that your dryer is clogged, unable to function efficiently and needs to be looked at. Even if you remove the link that you see, there will be lint inside the vent that cannot be removed without the proper tools.
If it’s been a years since you’ve cleaned your dryer venting system last, it’s time to get it looked at by BetterCare Appliances

Create equations and inequalities in one variable and use them to solve problems. Include equations arising from linear and quadratic functions, and simple rational and exponential functions.
The logistics of this lesson are really interesting. I want students to use white boards because I need them to be able to hold up their answers to slide 2 and 3 of the launch. However, before getting to those questions I ask my students to answer the question on slide #1 on their whiteboards. Most students are able to "just think" of the number that will make the statement true (MP2). However, some students will set up an equation and solve it. I will have students from both camps share their answer and how they obtained it. This simple categorization helps lead into today's lesson by giving students a glimpse of types of problems they will encounter in class today.
In my classes, it is often basic procedural mistakes that hold students back when using algebra to model a word problem (MP4). Slides 2 and 3 of the launch will get students "warmed up" by asking them to write some simple algebraic expressions. Again, students will use white boards and hold up their answer after each questions. I will use this "presentation" as an informal assessment of student readiness. My students will usually do okay on the first three questions.
On question Problem 4, some students will write "5-x" and others will write "x-5". I will put both of these up on the board and have students turn and talk with their partner about which is correct. Then, I will ask students to pick a specific number and imagine that number being decreased by 5. I'll ask,"Which expression would give the correct answer?" Usually after this intervention, Problem 7 will cause fewer issues. However if quite a few students are still writing "7-x", I will do another mini-lesson to move things in the right direction.
After the Launch, each student will be given a handout of the Guided_Notes. As we work on the problems in the notes, I will ask students to continue to show their work on their whiteboards. The reason I want both available is so that students can "mark up the text" of the word problem before trying to write their equation. To do this, students can underline, write expressions, circle words, etc (MP1).
For this part of class, I have students divide their mini-whiteboards into three sections with the middle section being the largest. When reading a word problem, the first thing I want my students to determine is "what are our variables?" (aka, "what do we want to find?"). I ask my students to place this information in the left portion of the whiteboard. The second thing I ask my students to do is to use the variables to write an equation or expression based on the problem description. Finally, I encourage my students to make sure that answers make sense by solving and checking in the right section of the white board. After this introduction, we start working on the problems as a class.
I generally don't like to read problems to students. So, I ask the entire class to read the first question to themselves either by looking at the projector or by reading the problem on their paper. On the first read-through they should only be reading. Then, I ask the class to read the problem a second time marking up the text as they read. Now, on the third pass, I ask students to construct an equation.
In questions #1-4, "the setup" would mean that students are defining their variable as "let x = the positive number" The work is shown in the middle section of the whiteboard.
One thing I stress is that students do their check using the original problem NOT the equation that they make. Students should take their solution (in the case of #1 the solution is 2) and substitute that value wherever they see "a number" or "the number" in the original word problem. I do this because if students construct the incorrect equation but then solve it correctly their answer still will not make the original problem true (MP6).
Questions #1-4 usually go fairly smooth. We go through them 1-by-1 and students work on the whiteboards and hold up their responses once they are complete. If some students are really excelling, I will have them work ahead using the guided notes.
In questions #5 and #6 the setup would include both expressions for both the length and the width of the rectangle (example: #5 would be "let x = width" and "let x+4=length"). For the check, their solutions should make sense for both dimensions (one is 4 more than the other) and should give the correct area.
Question #7 will require us to review how to set up variable representations of consecutive integers or consecutive even/odd integers before starting to write the equation to solve the problem.
I designed this closing activity to help me to identify which students are grasping the idea of writing quadratic representations to solve word problems. Before distributing it to the students I will remind the class that I still want to see all three parts in their solution (setup, work, and a check).

An ethical code was created by Tourist Union #63 during its 1889 National Hobo Convention in St. Louis Missouri. This code was voted upon as a concrete set of laws to govern the Nation-wide Hobo Body; it reads this way:
Always try to find work, even if temporary, and always seek out jobs nobody wants. By doing so you not only help a business along, but ensure employment should you return to that town again.
Do not allow yourself to become a stupid drunk and set a bad example for locals' treatment of other hobos.
When jungling in town, respect handouts, do not wear them out, another hobo will be coming along who will need them as bad, if not worse than you.
When traveling, ride your train respectfully, take no personal chances, cause no problems with the operating crew or host railroad, act like an extra crew member.
Do not cause problems in a train yard, another hobo will be coming along who will need passage through that yard.
Do not allow other hobos to molest children, expose all molesters to authorities, they are the worst garbage to infest any society.
If present at a hobo court and you have testimony, give it. Whether for or against the accused, your voice counts!

In lieu of instructions, I'm linking to Beth's blog where she used licorice as the base for her broomstick but you get the idea. If you want your broomstick to stand up like mine you'll need to cut off some of the wrapper at the top of the lollipop and make sure your broom pieces are long enough to stabilize the lollipop once you turn it upside down.

In this powerful and intimate memoir, the beloved bestselling author of The Prince of Tides and his father, the inspiration for The Great Santini, find some common ground at long last.
Pat Conroy’s father, Donald Patrick Conroy, was a towering figure in his son’s life. The Marine Corps fighter pilot was often brutal, cruel, and violent; as Pat says, “I hated my father long before I knew there was an English word for ‘hate.’” As the oldest of seven children who were dragged from military base to military base across the South, Pat bore witness to the toll his father’s behavior took on his siblings, and especially on his mother, Peg. She was Pat’s lifeline to a better world—that of books and culture. But eventually, despite repeated confrontations with his father, Pat managed to claw his way toward a life he could have only imagined as a child.
Pat’s great success as a writer has always been intimately linked with the exploration of his family history. While the publication of The Great Santini brought Pat much acclaim, the rift it caused with his father brought even more attention. Their long-simmering conflict burst into the open, fracturing an already battered family. But as Pat tenderly chronicles here, even the oldest of wounds can heal. In the final years of Don Conroy’s life, he and his son reached a rapprochement of sorts. Quite unexpectedly, the Santini who had freely doled out physical abuse to his wife and children refocused his ire on those who had turned on Pat over the years. He defended his son’s honor.
The Death of Santini is at once a heart-wrenching account of personal and family struggle and a poignant lesson in how the ties of blood can both strangle and offer succor. It is an act of reckoning, an exorcism of demons, but one whose ultimate conclusion is that love can soften even the meanest of men, lending significance to one of the most-often quoted lines from Pat’s bestselling novel The Prince of Tides: “In families there are no crimes beyond forgiveness.”

Olympics games seem to be a phenomena which the whole world is waiting for. Well, everybody knows the venue too. The 30th Olympic Games 2012 is slated to be held in London, United Kingdom. London city is in full flow heading for the preparations of the Olympic Games 2012.
There is no use wasting time on the fact that The Olympics are the biggest multi-sports event in the world. With a history of almost 114 years of organized celebration, Olympics carries a whole new definition of sports, integrity, nationality and brotherhood in every four year.
The first registered games of Olympics were held in Athens of Greece in the year 1896. Since then the event grew in volume and magnanimity to attain a cult status by today’s time.
The official logo of the Olympics is a set of five rings attached to each other signifying the five continents of the world. The easily recognized logo of Olympics suggests the coming together of the countries in these continents.
In 2012, the Olympics comes to London that has earned the reputation of hosting the game for the third time after 1908 and 1948.
The opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 Olympics will witness the touch of mastery as renowned film makers like Danny Boyle and Stephen Daldry will be the brains behind.
The mascots of this edition of this great event are Wenlock and Mandeville, two figures with one eye each with a metallic finish. Both of them are designed with deep implied meaning and conveys various messages to the world.
The major sports events that will draw the attention of the spectators and media in 2012 edition are swimming, archery, football, table tennis, volleyball, boxing and weightlifting. All the competitions will be held in various venues and stadiums that are constructed or modified keeping in mind the Olympics. A few of them are the All England Club at Wimbledon (tennis), Wembley Stadium (football) and The O2 (gymnastics, basketball).
The number of countries participating in the United Kingdom Olympics in 2012 goes up to more than 200 with the count of athletes touching the 18,000 mark.
The sheer grandeur that Olympics contains is beyond words and fictions, facts and figure. We have to just wait and watch as we move towards the due dates.

Been issued a speeding ticket? Failed to stop at a stop sign? What about your family members? And friends? If you are like most of us, the answer to at least one of those questions is “yes”—the vast majority of us have slipped up at least once or twice.
An innovative new website—Instant Checkmate is now revealing the full “scoop” on millions of Americans.
Instant Checkmate aggregates hundreds of millions of publicly available criminal, traffic, and arrest records and posts them online so they can easily be searched by anyone. Members of the site can literally begin searching within seconds, and are able to check as many records as they like (think: friends, family, neighbors, etc. etc.).
Previously, if you wanted to research someone’s arrest records, you might have had to actually go into a county court office—in the appropriate county—and formally request information on an individual. This process may have taken days or weeks, or the information might not have been available at all. With websites likeInstant Checkmate, however, a background check takes just a few clicks of the mouse, and no more than a minute or two.
While preparing this article, I decided to run a quick search on myself to give the service a real-world test. To my dismay, the search revealed several items I’d long forgotten—one of them being for the possession of a fake ID I was (embarrassingly) issued back in college when I was just 18 years old.
“possession of a fake ID I was (embarrassingly) issued back in college when I was just 18 years old”
After searching myself and finding those records, my curiosity was piqued, and I began researching family members—apparently my aunt Susanne isn’t a very good driver, judging by the numerous traffic citations that showed on her record.
One of the most interesting aspects of Instant Checkmate is that it shows not only criminal records, but also more general background information like court records, various types of licenses (FAA, DEA), previous addresses, phone numbers, birthdates, estimated income levels and even satellite imagery of known addresses—it’s really pretty scary just how much information is in these reports.
In addition to giving information on the specific person you search for, the report also includes a scrolling list of “local sex offenders” for whatever region you’ve searched—along with a map plotting out the locations of those offenders. I started perusing the ones that showed up in my report, and I was absolutely blown away when I stumbled upon my junior high school wrestling coach’s mug shot.
“I was absolutely blown away when I stumbled upon my junior high school wrestling coach’s mug shot.”
His crime was listed as “Out of state offense,”” so I wasn’t able to get the specifics (you usually can—this was an unusual case), but he was definitely a registered sex offender. Scary stuff.
I would definitely recommend this tool to friends and family. Anyone can start running background checks on Instant Checkmate within a few seconds—just click this link to get started.
I have to warn you before you start your search, the information you find may be overwhelming and has the potential of changing your view of the search subject forever. Keep this in mind when completing your search.

There is one undeniable delight in writing: You are able to preserve what you know, defend the facts of your knowing, reconcile the truth, and create your own bookshelf of your life’s work. There is a great moral duty and an ongoing human wondering in the task of the living author — one that must not be slighted in practice or disparaged in theory — even when the current events of the day and the damnation of history are upon us.
The idea of writing your own bookshelf — either physical or virtual or both! — is an enticing challenge that keeps one awake at night while also becoming the manna that feeds our dreams. Slowly, and with great deliberation, we place important ideas on the shelf to be shared and examined. It is that process of self-preservation that leads to revelation of character and a true intention of spirit.
Writing is a collaboration with yourself — as your own intentions and actions and acquisitions are called into question for examination against the greater self — the process is reflexive and recursive and not reflective or scripted. What you value becomes you and what you disparage becomes the aim of any enemy, real or justified.
The greatest achievement of writing your own bookshelf is the breadcrumb trail of ideas and advances you leave behind to outlive you. As I’ve written before, we write for the next 50 years ahead of us, not behind us.
Authors get into trouble when we allow the corruption of our worldview to become real — and that usually happens when the taint, and temptation, of money enters the dyad.
Instead of writing what we know and what we must share, the author instead turns outward, instead of remaining inward, to write the wishes and to compose the dreams of others who are unable to write with their own wands; and that is where dismay and disconnection and failure of duty come into play if one is not careful.
Certainly writing for profit is never a bad idea — and some of us preternaturally have extremely mainstream tastes that create universal human touchstones that cater to big money ambitions along the writing pathway — but for most writers, the reward is smaller and simpler and more ominously dangerous: You eschew who you are in order to make bank, and once that slippery slope leads you, there’s no easy way to cling your way back to the moral high ground.
I’m sure you’ve met the heartfelt sellouts — they think they’re playing a divine game of craft against commerce — but in the end, it is always business that ruins the day and wins the graveyard — and every great and aspirational intention of the author is mitigated to work-for-hire and to a foundering in the unemployment queue.
Of course, the modern idea of success in the USA is to become rich and famous and if you aren’t part of that bastardization of the American dream, you have a zero sum value and are a lazy, worthless, cog in the machine.
We know the opposite of that disparagement is true because the real value of the exchange between idea, and the preservation of seeing, is eternally bound in authorship — becoming the truth of the human condition in society.
If we lose what we do not value, then we must continue to protect and serve the right to write and the right to remember what is written — even if the memories are not our own — because the bookshelves we leave behind for each other become the library of us, and the shared notions of what we know is right, and necessary, and functional as a harbinger existence in a shivering world.
As I began to renew/refresh one of my blogs, the Universe somehow, somewhere, gifted me with the appearance of your blog – don’t know from where. Nevertheless, thank you for being who you are and for your blog. I’ve added you to my reader and look forward to your writing. Blessings and Belly Laughs!
what a lovely way to think about it. I guess I really DO write for myself and then if others enjoy or learn something from it or are moved in some way, so much the better.

We investigate the role of clouds, turbulence and aerosols in the climate system and develop approaches for representing them in large-scale models. We use experimental data from detailed laboratory experiments, extensive field campaigns and long-term observations, in combination with models ranging from molecular-scale to fully coupled Earth system models.
Many atmospheric processes of large importance for the global climate occur on size and time scales that are so small that they are not directly resolved in global Earth System Models. Examples of such phenomena are processes related to atmospheric aerosols,clouds and turbulent flows. This research area brings together scientists working on a detailed understanding of these processes, on developing approaches for representing them in large-scale models and on investigating their role in the climate system. The tools used in this research area span from detailed laboratory experiments to long-term field observations, extensive field campaigns, and from molecular-scale models to fully coupled Earth System Models.

A caller gets under Howard Stern’s skin and he lets off a unprecedented tirade for the next five minutes.
The caller wanted to talk with Howard’s previous guest, John Oliver from Comedy Central about Israel, and the Palestinians. He said Howard would “Change his tune” about supporting Israel. Stern says a few expletives, and then the caller says “Zionists run Israel”, and that’s when Howard Stern loses it.
It’s good to see that there are still a few in the very liberal media industry who are willing to speak against the tide.

The Earlham School Board will be meeting on July 12th at 6:00 PM in the library. A tentative agenda for this meeting is attached below.
The German Constitution (which is called "Grundgesetz", literally translated to "Basic Law") has the following to say about religious freedom:
(1) Freedom of faith and of conscience, and freedom of creed religious or ideological, are inviolable.
(3) No one may be compelled against his conscience to render war service as an armed combatant. Details will be regulated by a Federal law.
Article 140 of the Basic Law states that articles 136-137 of the Weimar constitution are part of the Basic Law. These articles are:
Civil and political rights and duties are neither dependent upon nor restricted by the practice of religious freedom.
The enjoyment of civil and political rights, as well as admission to official posts, is independent of religious creed.
No one is bound to disclose his religious convictions. The authorities have the right to make enquiries as to membership of a religious body only when rights and duties depend upon it, or when the collection of statistics ordered by law requires it.
No one may be compelled to take part in any ecclesiastical act or ceremony, or the use of any religious form of oath.
Freedom of association is guaranteed to religious bodies. There are no restrictions as to the union of religious bodies within the territory of the Federation.
Each religious body regulates and administers its affairs independently within the limits of general laws. It appoints its officials without the cooperation of the Land, or of the civil community.
Religious bodies remain corporations with public rights in so far as they have been so up to the present.
Equal rights shall be granted to other religious bodies upon application, if their constitution and the number of their members offer a guarantee of permanency.
When several such religious bodies holding public rights combine to form one union this union becomes a corporation of a similar class.
Religious bodies forming corporations with public rights are entitled to levy taxes on the basis of the civil tax rolls, in accordance with the provisions of Land law.
Associations adopting as their work the common encouragement of a world-philosophy shall be placed upon an equal footing with religious bodies.
So far as the execution of these provisions may require further regulation, this is the duty of the Land legislature.

It is not uncommon for modders to create "inaccurate" weapons on purpose. And they can be very useful in several situations.
- Adding special abilities and label for Zirah, at cost reducing hitpoints, but also will add 20 hitpoints if armor is complete set.
- Reworking at Zirah armors, now it's not regenerating anymore, HR Zirah have same hitpoints with standard Zirah, and Standard Zirah weight now greatly reduced.
- Reworking at "Tameng GE8", now the shield can invoke power manually rather than when shield is down.
- Reworking at sentinel base class, sentinel deployed in holding position, and they can be ordered to attack target. But still have sentry order, so when they friendly fire to other sovereign, player will not have his own penalty.
- Removing SAN and SAP at SMB, as these sentinel too dangerous and has chance to destroy other station.
- Reworking at Semesta auton, now they will not carry your supplies, AI has been changed, and automatically reload missile.
- Reworking at Sentinel base class, now Guard Station order instead Sentry order. Also, self-destruct order is available.

We hear from the late Winter Dance Party Tour artists (Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and Big Bopper), plus Dion talks about his thoughts on Buddy, Buddy cover from LEVI DEXTER & GRETSCH BROTHERS, a brand new tune from JD McPherson, Jerry Lee Lewis and lots more on this week's Rockabilly N Blues Radio Hour!! http://rockabillynblues.blogspot.com/2015/02/winter-dance-party-tour-and-lots-more.html
Overly stressed due to constantly battling a psychotic-ex for custody of my kids, over state borders; in the middle of transitioning between jobs; stressed to the gills due to a whole bunch of other "woe is me" crap and details I don't want to bother anyone with or get flamed about. I just need some help.
Straight to the point? I'm a 41 year old male, at 6 foot 3 inches, and 235 lbs. in clothing, pockets empty, as of today on a digital scale at the office. I have no immediate access to any sort of DEXA machine; and even if I did, I honestly can't afford to use the services of one at the immediate moment. I notice that certain physical activities and reactions that were not even a second thought before, I've taken for granted, and am missing. You know--not huffing and puffing over my gut, when tying shoes. Keeping it up, at the right passionate moment. You know... demoralizing, kind of important stuff like that. :-/
I'm going to include my picture in this post, as gross as I think I look compared to younger me, because I need help assessing where I am probably at for Bodyfat, in the eyes of you experts. Visually estimating Body Fat % with this URL (https://www.ruled.me/visually-estima...at-percentage/), I guess I'm about a 25% to 29%? I'm thinking that I should give a hard, earnest attempt at the Rapid Fat Loss Diet for 2 to 6 weeks, before gradually edging into something more sustainable to promote lean mass growth? I guess I'm thinking loss of actual "fat" is the priority for my health, and self-confidence, before I worry about getting jacked, cut, shanked, or whatever the cool kids are saying these days...
Any constructive criticism and input is appreciated--again, I could really use the help. Thank you any and all in advance.
Maybe a good approach would be not to care too much about the numbers and just focus on a healthy lifestyle and a decent deficit (less stress about numbers). And to be honest, it's going to take a while regardless.
When I put in my weight with no BF%, it defaults to saying I'm a 25% BF while being at a Cat 2. I thought maybe that was too "generous" if you will, and I'm more looking like I'm a Category 3 dieter. But it's numbers...and you're right. Healthy living should take the priority here. I'll just go with the high end of the range I provided, and work at changing me gradually from there.
I don't know the bf%, but I'd say you're category 3. Did you check the BMI chart that's included in the book?
How can you not like BYU? I don't know if they'll get past the Sweet 16, but I love watching teams ride one super dominant player through the tourney. Jimmer plays like a cheat code.
Any team that suspends a starter for a violation of an honor code which includes no sex and no coffee get a from me.
At kansas you can smash poon from the women's basketball team in the bleachers at Allen Fieldhouse and only get suspended for 2 weeks
Masturbation and caffeine are both serious sins in the Mormon church. Not so much the caffeine, but jerkin' your gerkin is definitely a no-no.
extra pts for banging a girl on the women's team, she's fugly but it dont matter when the lights are out
Man I thought UT had a good shot at making it to Houston for the final 4 a couple weeks ago, not so sure now
Well what religion is the exact opposite of Mormonism? Cause I would be the bloody POPE of that religion.
All the teams from the Big east could go far. The conference was insane this year. They're all battle tested.
actually BYU just lost thier forward so maybe they won't be as much of a problem in the conference tourney..
I also root for Nova locally, but they look like dogshit lately. If they go out in the first round of the Big East, some people are saying they could possibly get left out. I doubt it, but they have no shot. The Big East is very competitive, a lot of good teams beating up on each other. I think Pitt and Syracuse are both candidates to go deep.
I watched about 10 minutes of Gonzaga-St. Mary's. That surpassed my combined CBB viewing for the entire season.
Holy shit Villanova lost to South Florida in the play-in round of the Big East (also WTF is up with that tourney starting on Tuesday). They could be on the bubble.
Anyone see Rutgers vs St. Johns? Rutgers should have got another posession at the end. Player from St Johns stepped out of bounds with 1.7 secs left thinking the time had expired.
Same, that's 10 minutes more than me. I'll get in a pool and watch the Tournament but I don't really care. Not sure how that happened, I used to watch it every night and knew even the obscure teams.
Ohio State has the experience and talent and even in their two losses, they kept their poise and only lost by a few points. Haven't seen Duke this year but fuck them.
There are so many teams in the Big East now that they basically have two wild card rounds before getting to the quarter finals.
Was glad to see Villanova and Pitt fall... obviously wasn't thrilled with my Johnnies going down yesterday, but was their own undoing. I respect the fact that Lavin managed to turn a bunch of individuals into a team, but he's a terrible strategist. He got outcoached two games in a row in the B/E tourney and was damn lucky the officiating was as shoddy as it was in the Rutgers game.
I still like their chances to make noise in the NCAA tourney... as long as they don't have to play Louisville too early! Seems to be the only team that they truly can't conquer. Syracuse was a winnable game yesterday, they just made a lot of poor choices in the second half and could beat them on a slightly better night.
Watching Lavin get outcoached with those UCLA teams was a regular thing, I thought his years in the booth might have helped him get past that.
Wow crazy ass finish in the Vtech-FSU game. FSU hit what looked like the game winner as time expired but they went to review it and his fingertips were still on the ball when the clock hit zero and it was overturned.

we cant ever be comfortable and dress accordingly to whatever we're doing/weather/etc without being told we want attention.
if you see someone wearing pajamas at the mall you might be like, um ok. this is the same thing im thinking with gym shorts. people wear gym clothes to dress down in the same sense people dress down to paint a house. im not questioning the morality of it or any debating gender double standards.
in all seriousness most my threads arent from a religious viewpoint. im just questioning current trends. I just find it odd that these two things are popular. yoga pants can be questionable but theres nothing morally wrong with gym, well basketball shorts.
Not really an exhibitionist, I just don't limit my actions by the responses of a few who don't matter.
well there's glancing and there's leering, licking your lips when you look at a woman and just being creepy
Yoga pants are the most comfy pants ever. I have a ton of them. My work attire is really relaxed so I wear them a lot. Whenever I stop somewhere before work people always ask me if I'm going to the gym
If I'm wearing gym shorts or yoga pants it's way more likely than not that I worked out that day. What's it to ya
Do I wear yoga pants tho? I hate Baggy leggings or bell bottomed leggings so I guess I'm just wearing leggings

The previous forum and many other places on the internet both changes the color and underlines text in a hyperlink to make them easy to find. I've noticed the new forum only changes the color of the text. I prefer the previous strategy of both changing the color and underlining text of a hyperlink.
This link design was intentional, but just in case it is open for review I have added it to the issues list.
The colour changes on mouse hover, and the url appears in the lower left on my browser.That makes it fairly obvious it is a link.
I think adding links to a forum post can be a huge service to others reading the forum. I generally make an effort to link to a Parallax product when answering a forum question about which board or sensor would work best for some project. It takes extra time to add these links. When links are not easily seen, I feel like my time adding them is wasted.
Here's a copy of a recent post I made. I won't add a functional quote block so the text appears as it does in the original post.
The good news is, if I were designing a new board, it would be with a QNF, and there are 10.000 + in stock.
Digikey is out of both DIP and QFP but they have QFN chips in stock. Mouser doesn't have any QFN chips but they have both QFP.
I personally mainly use QFP chips. I really dislike QFN type packages since it's next to impossible to probe the leads on the chip once they've been soldered.
Edit: Can you guys see the "DIP" and "QFP" Mouser links? The links are blue but it's not obvious to me links had been added to the post. Don't answer the question about seeing the links here. Comment about the links (if you want to) in this thread.
I think the two links to Propeller chips at Mouser can be easily missed. I doubt I will continue to bother adding links like this if they are not likely to be seen.
I didn't want the discussion to wander off topic about the appearance of links so I added a link to this thread. I thought the link was nearly invisible in original format so I did as jmg suggested and altered its appearance to make it more obvious.
I think links added to the forum add more benefit than any benefit having uniform looking text may add and having uniform looking text which hides the links lessens the value of the forum.
I have to agree that the links are a bit too subtle, especially when it's short, like this. Underlining would be my preferred default.

I see the big ugly purple web cam link in this editor box but I don't see it in your post. I wonder if it will show up in mine. (Edit: Nope, it didn't show up but there it is again as I edit this post.)
I suppose adding the full URL will be easier than attaching a link to a word and that way no one is likely to miss it.
What do you mean Duane? I think that is a very beautiful URL. Imagine how terrible it would look underlined. Like scrawling a moustache on the Mona Lisa
What I don't like are those pages with articles full of words that have been linked to some definition somewhere a blue, underlined, mess that makes reading it a chore.
I'm pretty sure just about every browser has style settings for the way links and links which have already been visited are displayed. Anyone who doesn't like underlined links can change their style on their own computer. IMO, it's rude to decide what style someone should use on their own computer. If I don't want underlined links I'll change the settings in my browser to they're not underlined. I don't want someone else deciding how links should look.
Edit: I'm not sure if one can change the link style on a browser. Do any of you know? Is there a default setting on a page that leaves these sorts of decisions to the browser of does the webpage have to decide these things?
I seem to recall a setting in IE to change the way links looked but I didn't see an option in Chrome. I found something that said one had to change the CSS file to do this. This doesn't sound like a simple process.
I still think there should be a really good reason to change a setting from its default state in a browser. If something can be left up to the individual user to decide then the individual user should be the one to make the decision.
I can't think of a popular Web site that still uses underlining. I'm sure there are quality sites that do, but it's becoming less and less common. As an example, Wikipedia bolds but doesn't underline its links, and sets in blue. It's pretty standard now, from what I can see.
One thing the forum doesn't do, but should, is automate the tip-text to links. Example of above: when you hover over the big link of "this thread," the tip-text ought to be something like the title of that thread. External links should have the page title of the linked-to page.
The problem is with short links which, when shown in blue, are indistinguishable from normal text to the casual viewer. Boldfacing is definitely an option, but something other than color alone has to set them off.
Agreed the links can be lost. That's why you often see them with a heavier weight. Check Wiki, CNN, Yahoo, Google, really, just about anything. The reason, so they now say, is that underlining for links was never a good idea in the first place, from a graphical experience standpoint. (Now they tell me! I still have some sites I need to update.)
My comment is just that underlining, as a text decoration for links, is now infrequently used. Some sites use bold, others a slight variation in the font, others different combinations, and so on.
BTW, I think it's fine if the underline appears when the link is hovered over. Beats changing the font or font weight on, which almost always causes the formatting to shift around. Hate that.
Good taste and usability do not always go hand-in-hand. Subtlety is great for graphic artists, but a usable website is more like a carnival than an art gallery. Form should always follow function.
I was going to say I could live without underlined links but I changed my mind about posting a few seconds later. But now there's not a way to delete so I'll just say what I had planned to say but not say anything.

The Past is an objective look at what has happened. In contrast, Memories is a subjective look at what has happened. Therefore, Memories of the same events varies among individuals creating many different and possibly conflicting recollections. Often one's current feelings come from memories, both pleasant and unpleasant. Many a taut story revolves around a character's effort to resolve open issues from his memories by recalling or forgetting them.
a) The Impact Character is herself involved in "... a subjective look at what has happened ..." and that this SOMEHOW influences the Main Character?
b) The Impact Character causes (directly or indirectly) the Main Character to become concerned with "... a subjective look at what has happened ..."? Therefore the Impact Character is not necessarily herself involved in Memories, but her influence is such that the Main Character is now involved in Memories.
boy, have I struggled with this issue as well. But yes, I think you're right about "B". The impact character's purpose (dramatica-lly speaking) is always to affect, influence, change the main character. But then there is the "relationship" between them (the SS throughline). I've had a hell of a time distinguishing the two. But it sounds to me like you're on the right track.
phillybudd wrote: ... I think you're right about "B". The impact character's purpose (dramatica-lly speaking) is always to affect, influence, change the main character ...
The question remains whether the writer should treat "SP #1, Impact Character = Memories" as meaning ...
... the Impact Character is herself involved in (for instance)"Memories" and this involvement in "Memories" somehow - in a manner unspecified - affects the Main Character. If it's this option then the Main Character doesn't necessarily end up being involved in "Memories".
... an Impact Character Signpost of (for instance) "Memories" means that the Impact Character is affecting the Main Character in such a way as to cause the Main Character to get into "Memories" (a subjective look at what has happened).
In Approach a) the writer must figure out what the Impact Character of the story is doing that is concerned with "a subjective look at what has happened" ... and then figure out how this affects the Main Character.
In Approach b) the writer must figure out how the Main Character of his story is to be thrown into a "a subjective look at what has happened" by something the Impact Character of his story does. "Memories" therefore describes the outcome upon the Main Character. The Impact Character is not, herself, necessarily involved with "Memories". But the Main Character MUST end up in "Memories".
Approach b) is centred on the Main Character. When Dramatica assigns "Memories" to the Impact Character's 1st Signpost, the writer must then work on making sure that, at this point of the story, the Main Character is moved into "Memories" by something the Impact Character does. That seems very clear.
Approach a) does not seem to tell us anything about what state the Main Character must end up in. Only that wherever he ends up, he got there because the Impact Character was involved in "a subjective look at what happened".
I note that in both approaches, the Impact Character does need to remain within her Fixed Attitude Class.
prodos wrote: Either: one of these approaches is right and the other is wrong, or they're both right.
Based on my understanding of Dramatica and its theory thus far, both are right. Why? There are a few reasons that go something like this:
Dramatica does not tell the writer what to write, but rather it provides guides for the writer to consider when writing the story. Those guides allow the writer to look at the story through several perspectives; present psychologically sound, emotionally logical experiences for the characters; and those guides are there to be used only when they work, not when they don't. The writer always has the opportunity and the right to disregard what Dramatica suggests and write what their inspiration, what their intuition, tells them to write.
I wrote to two Dramatica experts (not Chris Huntley or Melanie Anne Phillips) and asked for their response to the issue I raised at the beginning of this thread.
Dramatica doesn't have to settle on either one because they're not mutually exclusive -- both a) and b) apply.
They're both correct because they both serve the same purpose by providing influence towards the Main Character's throughline.
... about your question. Here's my answer -- based on my own experience: there is no right or wrong interpretation of a Dramatica appreciation.
The only "right" one is the one that applies to your story -- this is very similar to what (Expert A) said and to the examples that come with the Dramatica software.
A brief look at the "Stories" on the Query System (IC Concern of Memories) will show that: "I Love Lucy": Ricky has memories; "Klute": Bree tries to forget something; "Quills": The Marquis produces memories; "Rear Window": Lisa strives to produce a lasting memory ....
In a nutshell: the only right appreciation is that the Impact Character is somehow involved with memories and that makes a strong effect on the Main Character's vision of the world.
IMDB: When Lucy comes back from the doctor she breaks the news to Ethel--she is pregnant. The girls are so excited and Lucy wants to tell Ricky the news the way she's always dreamed of ... When Ricky comes home for lunch Lucy tries to break the news, but he's too preoccupied with work to listen to her, and then Fred and Ethel come over and Ricky chats with Fred about what a bad week it's been at the club.
It seems to me that Ricky's preoccupation with business problems CAUSES Lucy to get into a state where she's probably very concerned with the issue of MEMORIES.
Probably something along the lines of "... oh man, we've tried so much to have a baby ... I had given up on it ... we've both almost accepted it as impossible ... now I want to break that negative expectation .... but your darned preoccupation with the week's troubles are keeping us stuck in the old perception ... I want to to tell you that the way the past has shaped our expectations is no more!"
As I said, I haven't seen the episode, but when the Dramatica software says .... "Ricky reminisces with Fred about the trials and tribulations of show biz" .... that seems to me to be rather "so what?"
So, I'm arguing that the point of the "reminiscing" ... is to accentuate Lucy's MEMORIES issues which are also the audience's MEMORIES issues.
The audience is (I'm guessing) feeling: Please shut up Ricky so we can all view the past in a completely different way. Let Lucy tell you the good news and you'll see everything in your life and your career up to this moment in a completely new and positive way!
i.e. Does an Impact Character Signpost of "Memories" mean the Impact Character gets involved with her own Memories and, as a result, affects the Main Character?
Or does it mean the Impact Character does things which result in the Main Character's "Memories" being affected? Or both/either are possible?
Looking at the Story Points Output for a story in which the Impact Character Signpost 1 is Memories, here is what appears in the report for each Throughline ...
OS Journey 1: as the Overall Story continues through Act 1 it grows from a concern with Gathering Information into a concern with Understanding
MC Journey 1: as (The Main Character) continues through Act 1 he grows from a concern with How Things are Changing into a concern with The Past
M/I Journey 1: as the relationship between (The Main Character) and (The Impact Character) develops through Act 1 it grows from a concern with Developing a Plan into a concern with Playing a Role
IC Journey 1: as (The Main Character) continues through Act 1, her impact on Memories deepens until it switches to Impulsive Responses
It says "her impact on Memories". Whose Memories? The character whose Memories are at issue is not specified.
I conclude from this that my view that the "Memories" affected must be those of the Main Character is NOT correct.
Dramatica does not tell the writer what to write, but rather it provides guides for the writer to consider when writing the story. Those guides allow the writer to look at the story through several perspectives; present psychologically sound, emotionally logical experiences for the characters; and those guides are there to be used only when they work, not when they don't.
( .... ) The writer always has the opportunity and the right to disregard what Dramatica suggests and write what their inspiration, what their intuition, tells them to write.
I certainly agree that the writer has the right and the opportunity to disregard whatever Dramatica comes up with.
If Dramatica said: "You must use this particular Impact Character appreciation in manner X, but not in manner Y", yes I can then turn around and defy this and use the appreciation in manner Y.
But if Dramatica says, "You can use this particular IC appreciation in EITHER manner X OR in manner Y", then if I use it in manner Y, what I'm doing is compatible with Dramatica.
For example, in our sample story, the Impact Character Throughline is in the Fixed Attitude (Mind) Class.
This means that the Impact Character will (in some order) force the Main Character to remember (Memory), to respond differently when there is no time for consideration (Impulsive Responses [Preconscious]), to become aware of something (Conscious), and to desire something (Subconscious).
Encode the Impact Character's Types by the impact the Impact Character has in that area of concern on the Main Character.
In this way, your Impact Character will force your Main Character to grow to a point of potential Change. That is the function and purpose of the Impact Character in a story.
The Main Character has gone so deeply under cover that no one at the agency has heard from him in days.
The Impact Character contacts and meets with the Main Character, finding him caught in a web of selfdoubt, unable to choose between sticking with his code or helping the children's hospital.
The Impact Character forces the Main Character to remember their days growing up together in the same neighborhood.
Recalling how the Main Character's thinking was not always so black and white, he urges the Main Character to learn a lesson from those memories
Both A and B are correct. It is the presence of Memory that influences the Main Character's in his dealings with his personal issues. Whether it is an attribute of the Impact Character, or attributed to the Impact Character is irrelevant.
Even if you do not connect the dots between the MC throughline and the IC throughline, the audience will.
We both know that Serious and Clips have stage presence..so if it was someone like rich dollarz i'd just wait to the video drop, but audio is cool enough for me when it comes to them.
ZoneAlarm free firewall and been happily running on my computer for a couple of years now. I found that they are selling their Pro version with id theft protection and their new anti-spyware for $30.
Zonealarm seems like a good company and the firewall is good so I think their antispyware should be good, correct?
I use Comodo Firewall on my personal Windows systems. ZoneAlarm's "DefenseNet" is similar to Comodo's "ThreatCast" which correlates other firewall activity and provides a rating/suggestion on a certain firewall event.
Their anti-spyware module should be fine. I would demo it first. Look for things such as signature updates and performance. Placing it in a demo virtual workstation is the best way to test. Try to get infected and see how it protects. Comodo has a antivirus module in their Internet Security app, but it does not perform well.
Besides the extra perks with the pro version, do they offer anything else like more frequent updates or support?
The problem is the views are stored in a non human readable format. There is a preferences.xml file in %appdata%LWD Technology, Inc/Realm Works but it doesn't have anything about tabs or views. I strongly suspect the data is in the multiple directories with the Unique ID names in that same directory but good looking figuring that out.
It's been a while since I poked around the internals, but you can see where some of these things are by opening (a copy of) your master.realm file in a text or hex editor and searching it. It won't help you copy it, though. (Once upon a time I'd intended to add some info about your realms to my helper application, but very little is available in any reasonable fashion. :(
The subfolders are definitely not one per realm. I only have 6 and have a couple dozen realms. Even the ones I open regularly are more than those 6.
How many have you opened since the last time you compressed or restored the database, deleted the preferences, or otherwise done app-wide maintenance operations?
As a test I deleted everything in the folder except the master.realm file and started opening realms; now I have exactly one subfolder per opened realm.
Rebuilding the index of a realm deletes exactly one folder from your subfolders and makes a new one with the same name (the names are the realm GUIDs, IIRC).
I don't know how other realm operations might affect it (notably import/export, as I haven't done any of that in ages) but in general it's one per realm.
I compressed the DB and still had the same six folders. I tried opening a realm I haven't done anything with in years and did get a new folder. I rebuilt the index and got the same thing you report. However I hadn't done anything with the DB or rebuilding any indexes in a long time. So I'm confused why I only had six. I have my main fantasy realm, I have the community realm, My Expanse based realm, My solar system atlas realm (started out as the Expanse realm but I realized an atlas of the solar system could be generally useful so I'm building it for export), and test realms for each of the game systems so that when people report problems I can test out the issues and try to help. That's 9 that get opened regularly.
Hmm...then I don't know. The copy of the folder I made before going on this journey has one per realm I have plus one, which I think was for a realm I'd deleted. None of this really matters; as we've both said, there's no human-useful information here and it's all implementation detail.
I did get it to crash a bunch on a realm where I'm a player. Guess it didn't like me deleting the index. :)
I think this has been a problem since the beginning. I brought it up a long time ago because my style was to prep some but wing it and it was not feasible to use RW at the table to take notes. I ended up writing notes down and putting them into RW later.
The best I could glean back then was that RW was intended for prep work and then clicking when things were revealed to players. Using these things for session notes, in terms of what was revealed and when. Not for taking notes or entering data during play. That's fine! It just didn't help me with my own style of running a game.
I'm hoping that the 64 bit upgrade will allow more memory, I also have decent PCs, and that will speed things up.
The 64bit upgrade will definitely allow more memory to be used. 64 bit programs can use essentially unlimited amounts of memory, its actually 16 exabytes but when a system comes out that has even 1 exabyte of RAM then we can start worrying about that.
Opening tabs and changing tabs is quite system intensive. The way it works is the act of opening or changing tabs reads everything in that 'view' into memory. So if you have a view that contains everything then everything gets read in. Try and create some custom views with topics limited to just what you need for your session. This can help quite a bit.
Holy crap Batman! It would probably help quite a bit if that behavior of the software were changed. There must be a better way to do it. I think it is good that there is now a setting that lets you tell it not to search your entire realm for text links every time you save anything, and more things like that should probably be considered for future refinements.
I haven't personally run into many bugs in Realm Works (one big one though), so the single biggest regular usage hassle for me is the lag.
It should only need to read the titles of topics, not "everything", in order to create the list of topics.

God created our bodies to need fuel. Every part of our bodies are carefully crafted and designed for assimilating the nutrients we need each day, and I think that snacking has helped me appreciate that even more. I often took for granted that my body needed that snacking. I felt guilty snacking, because I thought I was ‘out of control.’
I took my body for granted before I struggled with an eating disorder. For years my body was the center of my life. Yet, as God so mercifully shifted my focus, I began to realize just how much God takes care of us and our bodies and how much we don’t realize it.
I used to be afraid of snacking. I thought, if I ate in between meals, I would get ‘fat.’ I thought I would go out of control and eat too much.

Guys. Gals. Honestly, right now, I’m ‘feeling’ depressed, but here’s a question. Does that depression define me? Does it make me ‘me?’ this is something that I’ve thought about and prayed about and searched God’s Word for this year. What makes us valuable? What if someone told you, ‘You are enough?’ Would I have value if I was unable to do anything but open my eyes? Is a person’s value defined by their financial success or by something deeper and higher?
This year I wrestled with wanting to be successful, popular, have a million page views, and be enough for everybody. But that wore me out, and I felt like I didn’t have any purpose if I couldn’t be doing things, helping people, and sharing gifts. There were days of intense depression, dark tunnels that I felt like I couldn’t get out of. The valley of the shadow of death was something I walked through, but I felt guilty for walking through it because my actual life is SO good.
This song is the story of my life this year. I felt really broken; there were parts of me where I tried to cover over how broken I felt. I tried to keep helping others. i tried to keep up a good face.
Jesus Christ already did what you could not do. Jesus Christ already won the war. It’s called grace. It’s called unconditonal love. It’s not something you have to work to earn, deserve, or merit.
‘For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.’
God gave His Son. I didn’t ask for God to send His Son Jesus Christ to give me eternal life with God, eternal life in His presence. But He did. He took my place. He saw that I was dirty. He saw that all my works were like filthy rags, and He purposed to make me clean.
‘Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.’ (Psalm 51:7)
Jesus Christ purged us at the cross. Your value doesn’t come from what you feel you are today… because you may ‘feel’ that life has no purpose or meaning or direction.
you may see the person next to you with a home, family, and money, and wonder, ‘What is my life worth?’
Your life is WORTH EVERYTHING. So much so that God sent His Only Son from the courts of heaven to bring in broken, lost sinners to the fold. Your life is an eternal soul. Your life was something that God made, formed, gave value to; your life was made for God, for eternity, for glory!
Jesus Christ even, at the final hours, did not turn the thief on the cross away. Society might have looked at that thief and said, ‘You don’t have value.’ But Jesus saved him. Jesus promised that that man would be with Him in paradise.
It’s not anything we did. It’s all what Jesus Christ did on the cross. He took our place of condemnation. He showed man and woman that we were made for God. He showed us grace, unconditional love and value like no one ever has or will or can for eternity.
Cling to the Lord Jesus Christ, and in Him, your value will NEVER change. He never changes. Your value won’t change based on your feelings or what your friends say; your value is in God and who He made you to be, and the beauty of Christ Jesus and His righteousness that covers you.
It’s the beauty of Christ that covers you SO MUCH that God no longer sees any of your sins on you; they are ALL removed like a thick cloud.
What gives you value is the fact that you are a human, created in God’s image… #value #humanlife #recovery
You are a human, precious, eternal soul in the sight of God. You have value. And don’t forget it. <3
But you know who taught me this the most? The people that are with me everyday. The people that God used to tell me that they still loved me even if I didn’t make any money, even though I failed them, even though I had been mean to them, even though I didn’t deserve for them to love me back. This is my family, a gift from God, a precious reminder of my Savior Jesus Christ, the Shepherd of my soul, who loved me first.
‘For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.’ (1 Peter 2:25)

Creamy. That’s my favorite adjective to use for smoothies. That would have to describe each one of these smoothies that are part of this 2nd edition in the ‘Peanut Butter Smoothie Series’ with Crazy Richards, Blissful Eats, and Try About Time. I think I may have found my very favorite protein powder with Try About Time. They did send me it for free, but it has the absolute best texture in smoothies, and it also doesn’t taste overly sweet or artificial. . .
The first smoothie in this series …. would be one of my favorite desserts to have in the summer time. Have you ever bitten into delicious strawberries topped with cream with a slice of angel food cake? Well I didn’t put cake in this smoothie, but I’m humbled by how God’s glory and wonder can be seen in a little strawberry, the vast canyons of Utah, and the stars above. And when we see those things, that doesn’t even give us a millionth of a taste of the infinite glory of God!
Strawberries… It is a beautiful fruit. this year we probably ate the most strawberries we’ve ever eaten in the S. household. I’m not complaining about that at all; it’s been an amazing year for summer fruit.
The biggest lesson I’ve learned in recovery so far and am still learning is that recovery is about more than self love. Our perception of ourselves does matter, but where should that perception start? That was my biggest struggle throughout the years, months, days of recovery. I’ve been thinking about it all week especially since I wrote this post.

The EMIS website is replicated on a host of mirror sites around the world to ensure fast and reliable access from any location in the World Wide Web.
The following documents are intended for those who want to create or administer a mirror site of EMIS. These documents describe the technical and administrational aspects of the EMIS mirroring system.
It should be noted that EMIS only permits and recognizes those mirrors who adhere to the procedures set forth in these documents. Recognized mirrors are listed on the EMIS website, see the list of EMIS mirror sites.
Some conditions have to be met which are set forth in the legal agreement and the copyright agreement which prospective EMIS mirror sites must accept in order to be recognized.
The permission to mirror the EMIS website is subject to prior approval by the Executive Committee of the EMS.
Although the EMIS website can in principle be hosted on any HTTP server, technical support is only available for web servers running on UNIX operating systems. The following documents are all based on the assumption that the EMIS mirror is installed on an up-to-date UNIX system with permanent Internet access.
The preferred mirroring method uses the rsync program in version 2.4.6 or higher. If it is not included on your UNIX system, it can be obtained and installed from the rsync homepage. The mirroring procedure with rsync is described in the document Creating EMIS Mirror Sites with rsync.
Administrators still using the older, FTP-based mirroring system, should consider migrating to the rsync procedure. How this is done, is described in the document Updating the EMIS Mirroring Procedure.
Prospective EMIS mirror sites must name a mirror administrator who can be contacted by email in the case that there are technical problems or procedural adjustments in the mirroring procedure. Once configured, mirroring takes place automatically, but it still requires a small amount of procedural maintenance. Mirror sites without a responsive technical administration will be removed from the list of recognized EMIS mirror sites.

The legacy of the ‘second way’ is a morass of managerialist and bureaucratic practices. And so to the ‘third way’, in which no return to the welfare consensus seems possible, and the market mechanisms are equally unacceptable. Often represented as a positive period in which creativity can be unleashed and we can experiment with new ideas, the reality is the opposite. The new freedom is not a happy thing but leads to uncertainty and constant change. We have already seen how the new epistemology and ethics of FE professionalism is based on ‘uncertainty’ as a ‘positive’ value.

It’s fairly easy to build your own website if you take advantage of the many free learning opportunities online. However, much of the population isn’t equipped to build their own site, or doesn’t have the time, which is why so many people make a living building websites and blogs for others. According to the BLS, around 16% of web developers were self-employed in 2016, with the vast majority able to work at home, or anywhere with a laptop and speedy Internet connection.
Has anyone ever told you you have a voice for radio? Are you great at creating original characters with just your voice? There are tons of people looking to pay for quality voice overs for their corporate videos, animation series, or educational videos. Check out Fiverr and UpWork or create a profile on a specialized site like Voices.com or The Voice Realm to get started making money online doing voice overs.
the problem with “CashCrate” is that the amount of money that u get out of it is VERY slim.. and even to get that VERY slim portion of money you have to complete a lot of surveys and to cash-in on the money you earned u must make over $20, trust me. i tried it, it took me over 6-12 months to get the cash.. i used the site like if my life depended on it. it was very hard.
Hey!, I’m just putting some feelers out there to see if there’s anyone interested in making a pretty substantial amount of cash in a short amount of time. Only thing this requires is that you have an active bank account or credit card in the US. No cash is required up front to start. Which means your account can be on a zero balance and that’s completely fine. There are different money deals that suit just what you want, contact 44royaltom@gmail.com
Web development is a job often performed online that pays a significant income. It's not reliant on location or any other factor. it simply boils down to skill and hustle. As a software engineer, I have spent endless hours debugging code. It's often frustrating. Unless you love what you're doing, it could seem like grunt work. But the pay is incredible.
Whether you want to become your own boss, start a side hustle, or earn extra money on the side, any of the strategies listed above can help. By finding ways to increase your income, you can free up more cash to pay down debt, save for the future, or invest for retirement. Saving money is only half of the equation. And if you truly want to get ahead, you might want to figure out how to make money – and hopefully, lots of it.
Start analyzing your decisions from the perspective of a firm. In economics, a firm's goal is simply to maximize profit. Well-run firms spend money only if they can expect to make more money from their investment, and they allocate their resources to the most profitable use. You're not a firm, of course, and you have other considerations, but if you make the majority of your time and money decisions by choosing the options that promise the highest return on investment, you'll likely earn more money, and that's good news for your shareholders (you and your family).
Travel blogging is a hard industry to break into. However, the rewards can be worth it, and let’s face it, who doesn’t want to be paid for traveling around the world! There are numerous ways to monetize a travel blog, but affiliate marketing should predominantly be your focus. On your blog, promote hotels, tours, equipment hire services, flights, and anything else travel related. Then take a cut of the proceeds as your audience books their holidays based on your recommendations.
And, as you can see, they actually have some survey opportunities that are well worth it, like a payout of $6.42 for a quick 11-minute automotive study. There’s other ways to earn aside from surveys like watching videos, checking email and participating in panels. The opportunities available will depend on your demographic information. But once you sign up, you can start earning and even receive a $2 bonus for filling out your information!
I surprisingly get a lot of people asking to detail their car. I never intend to make a business of it, but I love doing it to my cars and people ask me to do it to theirs. All it takes is a cheap orbital buffer (mines a used craftsman) and a shop vac. I normally get easily $100 for a basic wash/wax/vac, or $200 to remove scratches and polish then wax the car.
Below is a huge list of companies (over 90!) that do mystery shopping, remote call monitoring, or some other “customer engagement research.” We did not vet the companies on this list, we only checked that their websites loaded and that they appear to still be in business.

Before you sign up for anything, please review my post about how to spot a mystery shopping scam plus the Federal Trade Commission's tips.

This magazine is all about The Big Apple, so if you’ve travelled to or live in New York, consider submitting a pitch. They’re looking for original, compelling, heartbreaking, funny, enraging, and enlightening stories that cut through the dull hum of the internet and help their readers better understand New York City and the people living in it.

But once you’re in your home office—alone, every day—you might start to miss that collegial camaraderie. Since the UPS incident, I’ve reached out more to colleagues via IM and will post cute pics of my new puppy for my colleagues to see on Yammer. And when we’re on deadline, we even (gasp!) talk on the phone. It’s helped tremendously to make the disconnect not feel so severe. It’s a good balance between having peace and quiet when you need it and much-needed interaction with others, too.

Kevin Edwards, Global Client Strategy Director of AWIN, put it this way: “Data will continue to underpin the channel’s success. When one of the world’s most important marketers bemoans the state of digital marketing as opaque and lacking transparency, it sends a clear signal about the opportunity for affiliate marketing. P&G’s chief marketing officer made that statement earlier in 2017 and it should be a lightbulb moment for us about positioning the channel as the foremost, results-driven opportunity available to digital marketers. This can only be achieved if we get better at sharing significantly more data to facilitate a more three-dimensional and qualitative view of affiliate marketing beyond last click. Lifetime value holds the key to building a more rounded view of the power of affiliates to deliver quality customers.”

While most of these companies advertise that you can earn upwards of $18 or so an hour, the reality is that you're not going to make that much once you figure in your gas expenses and wear and tear on your car. Also, work may not always come in consistently. I would recommend doing more than one of these if you really want to make it worth your while.

Of course, as a guidebook author you’ll be paid a salary, plus you’ll have money to pay for your travels in the destination you’re writing about. For the blog, we’ve heard that between $300 – $400 per article is possible, but they still accept some free posts too if you’re pitching as a “guest post” with a link back to your site.

Affiliate marketing is one of the most popular ways people make money online. It is a strategy where an individual partners with a business in order to make a commission by referring readers or visitors to a business’s particular product or service. But that really is quite a simple explanation. To be really successful at making money with affiliate marketing there is a little more to it.
Regardless if you need to earn some fast cash or we're just talking about making money in the grand scheme of things, there's an important psychology that needs to be mentioned before getting into the strategies. If you study Freud's model of the mind, you'll discover the Psychic Apparatus. It's the three-part construct in your mind that controls all of your behavior.
The cash back industry is ruthlessly competitive, isn’t it!? All these apps want new users, which means you can load up on welcome bonuses. The Ibotta app is another opportunity to get a bonus: they are giving people $10 when they sign up. Unlike the other apps mentioned in this article, Ibotta specializes in getting you cash back at grocery stores.
A work from home job can be any position that does not require you to be in an office. There a wide range of work from home jobs. Some companies offer opportunities for employees in traditional roles to work remotely for all or some of their workweek. These jobs often use technology for meetings, assignments, and collaboration. This practice is called telecommuting. Other work from home opportunities may include jobs such as customer service representatives for which companies will hire remote workers, or part-time virtual assistants to manage work which does not require a physical presence in the office.
Jason Fladlien's $100 million career in webinar hosting is a true testament to what can be done when you master the art of selling in this medium. Daniel Waas, Director of Marketing for LogMeIn, the parent company of GoToWebinar, which is the largest webinar platform in the world, says that the company has over 55,000 active customers and hosts over 2.7 million webinars every single year.
You know those top-down cooking or craft videos you just can’t seem to get away from these days? There are people out there making a living from them. 78% of B2C companies depend on user-generated content, like those videos, for their marketing campaigns. You can sign up as a creator on a site like Darby Smart and potentially work with brands like Nordstrom, Mattel, and BarkBox. Or, use them to build your YouTube following and monetize through ads and views.
Work at home transferring data from one source to another. Most of these companies do not require past experience, although with few exceptions the pay may not be enough to consider it a stable income. Before you begin applying to any of the companies below (many of which sadly are almost never hiring), you might want to read the post I wrote about data entry jobs from home. It explains what your expectations should be prior to pursuing a career in this industry.
With so many businesses operating mostly, or even completely, online, it’s no wonder that many hire virtual assistants to help keep them organized and complete administrative tasks. According to the International Virtual Assistants Association, these workers are “independent contractors who (from a remote location, usually their home or office) support multiple clients in a variety of industries by providing administrative, creative, and technical services.”
If you would like to take a more subtle approach, include a product or service from your company that relates into your blog post. For example, let’s say that you are a wine connoisseur and that is what your blog is based around. In any post that is enticing your readers to open up a good bottle of Merlot or what have you, it would be wise to embed an ad for a quality, easy-to-use wine opener, wine glasses or stoppers that keep the wine fresh.

Getting a raise is harder than getting a promotion. Think about it from your boss’s perspective, would you rather a) pay more money for the same service, or b) pay more money for additional responsibilities. Regardless, sometimes a raise is in order, especially if you have worked for several years without one. Check out Ramit Sethi’s guide on asking for a raise.
Life expectancy is increasing, but as a result many people are living longer in poor health. Coupled with rising medical costs and the potential cutbacks on programs like Medicaid, it is extremely important that everyone, especially those in their 50s, begin to address the major components of long-term care (LTC).
70% of people over the 65 will need long-term care services with the average nursing home cost in Hawaii at $135,050 for a private room. This may be a worrisome fact, but with proper planning, you can prepare for those expenses or prepare a way to pass your hard-earned assets to your loved ones if you don’t.
In this article and video series we address how you can create a long-term care plan that will help meet your future financial and long-term care needs. You can also click here for more information on long-term care at The Art of Thinking SMART.
LTC is a range of medical and non-medical support for people of any age, primarily for seniors. LTC provides assistance with the Active Daily Activities (ADLs) which include:
70 percent of people will need long-term care services at some point after turning age 65. As a result, it is important to create a long-term care plan.
The average length of LTC service is 3.7 years for women and 2.2 years for men. 20% of those who will need LTC will need it for more than 5 years.
Long-term care costs vary depending on the type of care needed. For example, in 2013, one year of care and services at an adult day health care center, cost an average of $16,900. Long-term care costs vary depending on the type of care needed. The cost of long term care has steadily increased every year, with Hawaii’s costs among the highest in the country! For one year, the cost of a nursing home (private room) is $135,050 and private-duty home health aide is $58,525.
Statistics are from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Clearinghouse for Long Term Care information website.

Xinca was chemically immobilized Nov. 17 for a complete physical that included cleaning his teeth and taking a semen sample. He stopped breathing about 80 minutes into the procedure and was resuscitated by the staff, but he never regained full consciousness and died Nov. 21.
“We have a team of people that’s been through jaguar immobilizations,” said Michelle Smurl, animal-programs director. “Masaya (Xinca’s mate) had been done about a year and a half, two years ago because she needed a root canal. So we’re skilled here
While anesthesia can always lead to complications, none were expected because Xinca seemed to be a healthy cat and had been chemically immobilized for previous exams. Still, the zoo’s veterinarian, vet technicians and a visiting veterinarian who wanted the semen for research were prepared, Smurl said.
The team also received assistance from the Animal Emergency and Critical Care Center of Brevard and consulted with a neurologist.
Necropsy results that could shed more light on why Xinca died may take weeks. A necropsy is the animal equivalent of an autopsy.
“It’s really hard sometimes to determine cause of death on exotic animals,” Smurl said. “They’re not as studied as human beings are, or even cats and dogs.”
The zoo conducts physicals on its jaguars every two or three years, Smurl said. Xinca’s teeth needed attention, and routine physicals are necessary for the animals’ health.
Complications from anesthesia are one of the least common causes of death in jaguars, according to a study published in 2006 by Sharon Deem, who was then at the National Zoo in Washington, and Katharine Hope, who now works at the National Zoo.
Thirty of the 39 Association of Zoos and Aquariums institutions they surveyed about jaguar diseases and deaths responded.
Of the 87 deaths the study examined, about 3 percent were attributed to anesthesia-related causes; 2 percent were blamed on “immobilization/transport.”
Most were attributed to stillborn or neonatal causes (20 percent), reproductive issues (17 percent) and musculoskeletal/neuromuscular causes (13 percent).
Brevard Zoo, which is accredited by the AZA, lost a black jaguar named Onyx in in 2000. She appeared fine after an immobilization, but died hours later.
The death, attributed to capture myopathy, was different, Smurl said. “Basically, she was at a level of stress where her muscles were starting to break down.”
“Animals die, and we were not neglectful,” Smurl said. ” . . . We have a great track record with all the agencies that work with us.”
University of Florida associate professor Darryl Heard, an expert on animal immobilizations, said anesthesia always carries risks.
“Even the most routine procedure can result in unpredictable, life-threatening problems,” he said in an e-mail response to questions.
Heard said he believed in annual anesthetizing of animals for examinations, dental care and other procedures. Animals aren’t immobilized too frequently, he said.
“I often have found the opposite to be true in zoos — the animal is not anesthetized until it is very ill, and any medical problem is not able to be corrected,” he said. “Although there is risk, the benefits of routine health care far outweigh this issue.”
In Arizona, controversy surrounds the death of a wild jaguar last March. He was accidentally caught in a trap, anesthetized, fitted with a radio collar and released, but indications of deteriorating health led to his euthanization.
There are many questions surrounding his death; one is whether the controversial drug used to anesthetize him, Telazol, contributed to his fast decline.
Immobilizations are not taken lightly, she said; Xinca’s physical was “multi-purpose” and necessary.
“How else are you going to gather information on an exotic animal . . . whose personality typically wants to kill you?” she said. “You can’t.”
The semen sample was incidental to the physical and was important to research on preserving rare animals’ semen for future species survival, Smurl said.
Zoo staff members are still mourning the loss of the animal, but Masaya, the female jaguar, is “probably doing better than we are,” Smurl said. “She’s a strong cat. They’re solitary, remember.”
Brevard Zoo is continuing with plans to open a cheetah exhibit in February. Smurl expects it will be at least a year before Masaya is paired with another jaguar. The female had three cubs with Xinca that are all now at other zoos.
As for Xinca, “we’ll wait until we get results, and then we’ll determine if we need to change anything.”

The likelihood is that, if you only measure how often you call on a prospective customer, you’ll be interested in how often you see that person. Similarly, if you only measure your feedback after the event, it’s probable that your focus will only be on the event feedback. And finally, if you decide to track the types of call you make or the types of organisation you go to, then that’s what will occupy your thoughts.
As it happens, how you decide to measure performance is secondary to deciding what to measure. Because its in deciding what to focus on – and what you expect – that guides how to measure and therefore what to inspect.
Too often, we get carried away with how we’re going to measure something – number of calls, feedback, and customer type – rather than what we’re going to measure – the quantity, quality of direction of our activity.
Acknowledging that our results are an aggregate of all three variables should mean that we measure activity in all areas and not just one or the others. In the event that we don’t do this, then we ultimately gain a disproportionate emphasis on one. And herein lies the problem.
Do you focus on the number of delegates, their willingness to recommend at the end of it, or the type of person in the room?
If you want maximum attendance, quality content and the right customer group then we need to measure all three. But conversely, if you just want to show attendance is up, that the quality was great or that you got the right type of person there, then pick the one you want more of.
The next time you measure the result of something – be it an event, a demonstration, a call or an evaluation – be sure to inspect what you expect and consider quantity, quality and direction.

Six months ago, I was dead. My heart didnt beat within my chest. Breath did not pass between my lips. Everything was gone, and I was dead.
Its not easy to think about, not existing?despite how much I fought to be forgettable all those years. So Ive chosen not to think of it at all.
My therapist asked me to write down my thoughts and feelings in this journal. After months of avoiding the assignment, I figured I should try it once?then maybe I could finally get some sleep. Im doubtful, but Ill try anything.
I dont honestly remember what happened that night. I get glimpses and moments of panic in my nightmares, but the details evade me. And Im not looking to fill in the blanks.
I woke up in a hospital bed, barely able to talk, with dark bruises on my neck. There were bandages wrapped around my wrists to protect the raw skin. A sling supported my dislocated shoulder, and a cast concealed my ankle after reconstructive surgery. I dont know what I went through to end up that way. All I care about is that Im breathing.
The police asked questions. The doctors asked questions. The lawyers asked questions. Whenever theyd start to talk about the details, Id close them off, or leave the room. Evan and Sara promised to keep the details from me as well. They werent there that night, but they were in the courtroom for the entire trial?as brief as it was.
It’s so hard to even write her name. She pled guilty. I didnt have to see her. I didnt have to testify. I didnt have to listen to the witnesses’ testimonies. They summoned Sara and Evan, and I couldnt be there for that either?even though the lawyers requested my presence.
And George. . . from what little I overheard, he was there that night. He was the one who called the ambulance. They didnt press charges. I begged them not to. Leyla and Jack need their dad. And now… Now I dont even know where they are. I hope they remember how much Sorry. I cant. It hurts too much to think about them.
Sara and Evan have barely left my side since that night. Ive tried to assure them that Im okay, but they just have to look at the circles under my eyes to know that Im not. In truth, I dont want to be alone.
There was some press, but it was a closed trial, and the records are sealed because Im a minor (Im pretty sure Saras father had some influence over that too) ?so there wasnt much for the papers to write about.
The town exploded with news of the attempted murder, and you can only imagine what it was like to return to school, or to be seen anywhere in Weslyn. Whispers. Pointing. Eyes following me everywhere. Ive become a morbid celebrity?the girl who survived death.
Even the teachers treat me differently, like they’re waiting for me to shatter. The small group that confronted me that day are especially wary. Their interference is what put the whole ordeal in motion. Theyd made a call to the authorities before speaking with me, and then called George when I left the school.
Carol must have found out about their call to George, or maybe someone from the state contacted her to look into the allegations. Either way, she was desperate for me to disappear ?forever. But it doesnt matter what made her do it. She cant hurt me now.
I do hurt. Im not going to deny that. Especially since no one will ever see this journal. My ankle will probably never be the same, and will remain a constant reminder of what I went through. I fought to recover, and despite the anticipated outcome, I returned to the soccer field four months later. At the beginning, I would cry in the shower after each practice and game. The pain was almost unbearable. But now I barely notice it.
Nothing looks the same anymore. Nothing feels the same. Im not sure how to explain this to Sara and Evan. I dont know if theyd understand. Im not sure that I do.
I keep telling myself thats shes gone. Shes in prison where she can stay for as long as forever, as far as Im concerned. But I dont feel safe. Especially when I close my eyes each night and shes right there waiting for me.
I need to get out of Weslyn. Away from the stares. Away from the shadows that continue to haunt me. Away from the pain that paralyzes me when I least expect it. Six more months and all of it will be gone. I get to start again, with the two people I love most in the world.
It’s just a dream. I recognized the thought, trying to pull me out of the hands that drug me to the darkest depths of the water. But panic overshadowed the rational thought, and I kicked as hard as I could. It’s just a dream, my voice echoed through my head again, trying to wake me.
I looked down into the murky water, my breath burning in my lungs. The hands were now long, jagged claws, and as I kicked, one claw pierced my ankle, anchoring me under the water. A dark cloud surrounded me as the blood oozed around its nails. I struggled against it, but it only tore deeper into me. A rush of air bubbled around me as I screamed in pain. I was about to inhale my death when something pressed against my face.
I shot up with a gasp, the pillow falling from my face. Disoriented and panting, I searched the room. Sara stood frozen by her bed, her eyes wide and mouth open.
“I’m awake,” I exhaled quickly. With a deep breath, I pushed the panic away. Sara remained stunned even after I’d recovered.
What are you talking about?” I brushed off her apology. “It was just a dream. I’m fine. ” After another deep breath to ease the shaking, I pulled back the covers. They clung to the layer of sweat covering my body.
“Good morning, Emma,” she finally returned, forced out of her guilt-ridden stupor. And just like that, it was over, thankfully. “I’m going to take a shower. We have to hurry. We’re leaving in an hour. ” She grabbed her things and disappeared.
I’d been trying to prepare myself for this day for over a month. It didn’t matter. I was still freaked just thinking about it. And now it was here.
I collapsed back on the bed and stared up at the white glowing skylights that lined the ceiling, the morning sun hidden behind the snow.
I looked around the room that had no true connection to me?the large flatscreen hanging on the wall, and a vanity in the corner, lined with makeup that had seen way too many makeovers at my expense. There were pictures of laughing friends taped to the mirror, and vibrant art adorned the walls. No reminder of my life before I came here. It was the place where I’d been hiding ?hiding from the judgment, whispers and stares.
Why was I here? I knew the answer. If I had the choice, I’d never leave. It’s not like I had anywhere else to go, and the McKinleys wouldn’t turn their backs on me. They were the only family I had, and for that I would always be grateful. But that wasn’t completely the truth. They werent the only family I had.
So when the phone rang while Sara was in the shower, I sucked in all the courage I could gather, put the phone to my ear and said, “Hi. ”
“Oh! You’re there,” my mother exclaimed, completely taken by surprise. “I’m so glad I was finally able to catch you. How are you?”
“Just a party with some friends,” she replied, sounding just as awkward as I felt. “Listen. I was hoping we could try, you know. . . I mean, I live pretty much in Weslyn now if you ever decide you’d like to. . . ”
“Sure,” I answered, trying to sound sincere. “I mean, I’m leaving for college soon, so better reconnect now than when I’m across the country, right?”
She was silent, probably digesting that Id just invited myself to move in. "Uh, yeah, that sounds great. When are you thinking?"
“Meaning, this Sunday? As in, three days from now?” There was no hiding the panic in her voice. My heart skipped a beat. She wasnt ready to take me back, was she?
“Would that be okay? I mean, I don’t need anything, just a bed, or even a couch. But if its too much. . . Sorry, I shouldnt have?”
“No… no, that’s perfect,” she stumbled. “Um, I have time to get your room ready, so… sure, Sunday it is. I live on Decatur Street. I’ll text you the address. ”
“You too,” I returned before hanging up the phone. I stared up at the ceiling. What did I just do?! What was I thinking?
I grabbed my things and walked past Sara into the bathroom, trying to control the panic rising inside of me. By the time I emerged, I had come to terms with it. It was what I had to do.
“So, I have something to tell you,” I began, sitting on the stool next to Sara while her mother, Anna, poured herself a cup of coffee. “I spoke to my mother this morning. . . ”
“What made you decide that was the best thing to do?” Anna asked calmly, diverting attention from Saras silent disapproval.
“She’s my mother,” I shrugged. “I’m leaving for college soon, and I don’t think I’ll have another opportunity to try to fix us. I haven’t exactly been fair to her, and she keeps trying to connect, so I thought this was the best way to do it. ”
Anna nodded, considering my explanation. Sara stood up and briskly walked to the sink to drop her bowl in, still unable to look at me.
“Well, Carl and I will need to talk about it since we were given guardianship until you’re eighteen. And I’d really like to meet her before anythings final. Okay?”
I nodded, not expecting Annas answer. I wasnt used to having a parent actually care about me, so I didnt really know what to say.
“I understand why you want to do this,” Anna assured with a soft smile. “Let us just talk about it first, thats all. ”
Sara stormed up the stairs without a single word. I exhaled deeply before following her up the stairs.
"I dont have anything to say," Sara quipped. But she did; it just took a three hour car ride to the hotel and a day of primping before it came out.

“In the foreword, Andrew Weil (Mind over Meds, 2017) theorizes that the human desire for transcendent experiences may be hard-wired, a point Rosenfeld develops throughout this extensive and greatly expanded update of the original 1973 edition of a book designed to ensure that “these extraordinary states of being would be available to all” without using illegal psychedelics. Rosenfeld presents a comprehensive, even dizzying number of drug-free methods for altering consciousness; each is accorded a detailed description and thoughtful commentary. Personal motivation is key, whether altered states of consciousness (ASCs) are used for medical treatments, palliative care, DIY-training in sensory awareness, or other personal goals. Aware of the internet’s overwhelming jumble of “infinite resources” touting ASCs, Rosenfeld brings order to the subject in a well-designed, captivating, encyclopedic volume with three main sections—“Self,” “Help from Others,” “Devices and Machines”—that are meticulously divided into categories with dozens of subsets. “Religions, Mysticism and Movement,” for example, includes transcendental meditation, martial arts, flower arrangements, tantric sex, faith healing, revival meetings, haiku, and flash mobs. Rosenfeld also covers ways to increase concentration, biofeedback, skydiving, kayaking, music, and much more and lists further resources to enrich the understanding this lively, widely appealing, and extraordinary compendium affords. Reading Rosenfeld’s guide is itself a high.”

Answer: Although home sellers must disclose any deficiencies in their homes, many homeowners are not aware of some of the issues that could exist at their home. For instance, many homeowners do not go up on their roof or in their crawlspace (if their home has one) and therefore may not be aware of conditions that need repair. A Home Inspector can help identify those issues.
Answer: The cost of a Home Inspection varies depending on several issues. The size of the home, the age, the foundation and the complexity all can factor in to the cost of a Home Inspection.
Answer: A well conducted Home Inspection should take approximately 1 hour per thousand square feet. This time can vary depending on many of the same issues mentioned in the question above. Older homes take longer than newer homes because of the effects of aging and the tendencies of home owners to modify homes over time. A crawl space generally takes longer to inspect than a basement or a home on a concrete slab. Inspectors who spend only 2 hours looking at a 3000 square foot home are likely working too fast, which is known as a "drive-by Inspection".
Answer: Most states have adopted licensing for Home Inspectors. If that is the case where you live, then the State also provides rules or standards for conducting a Home Inspection. Your Home Inspector is obligated to follow those rules to the best of his/her ability. If the State you live in does not license Home Inspectors, then the Inspector is not required to follow any rules. However, HABITEC recommends that in this case you hire a Home Inspector that commits to an agency that offers standards for Home Inspections. The best agency for this is ASHI, or American Society of Home Inspectors.
Answer: Ask them. They should readily offer proof of their license. Also, one of the requirements for licensing is to have adequate insurance.
Answer: A home buyer is not required to be present for the Home Inspection. However, it is recommended that at least one of the buyers attend all or some of the Home Inspection. A great deal can be learned by talking to the Home Inspector about the house you are trying to purchase. A good Home Inspector will offer and take the time to walk around and through the house with you to discuss his findings and answer your questions. This is usually done at the end of the Inspection after the Inspector has the opportunity to get the “big picture”. If your Home Inspector does not offer this service, look for another one.
Answer: Most Home Inspectors offer a computer generated Home Inspection Report to present their findings. The best companies include digital pictures embedded in the report to add clarity to the discussion. Before hiring a Home Inspector, ask for a sample of their report and make sure it includes color digital photos.
8. If I have questions after seeing the Home Inspection Report can I call the Home Inspector to get answers?
Answer: Reputable Home Inspection companies offer this service. A good Home Inspection Report will leave few questions for the home buyer but it is virtually impossible to eliminate all questions. A few minutes on the telephone can clear the air quickly.
Answer: Ask the Home Inspector for references. A good Home Inspector should be able to offer at least 6 names of Clients or Realtors they have worked with who will speak on their behalf. Also, a Home Inspector should offer testimonials from previous Clients. The best companies make this information readily available on their website.
Answer: Some franchise operators offer something called a warranty. Be careful. Often the fine print on these “warranties” makes it virtually impossible to recover your money should the appliance or system that is “insured” fail. In truth, there is no way a Home Inspector can guarantee an appliance or system will work beyond the day it was Inspected.
ANSWER: Radon is an odorless and invisible radioactive gas that in produced from the natural breakdown of the uranium found in most rocks and soils. As the breakdown occurs, radon emits atomic particles into the air we breathe.
ANSWER: Once inhaled, these particles can be deposited in our lungs. The energy associated with these particles can alter cell DNA, thus increasing the risk of lung cancer. In fact, he Surgeon General of the US has warned that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the US. The National Academy of Science estimates that radon causes between 15,000 and 22,000 lung cancer deaths each year in the US. Any home can have radon.
ANSWER: The only way to know is to have the home or building tested for radon. For this reason, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Surgeon General recommend testing all homes for radon every two years! HABITEC recommends that buildings in Zone 1 (High Risk) areas with basements be tested every year.
Radon can enter the home through cracks in the concrete foundation or around openings at plumbing and/or electrical penetrations. Radon gas will follow the path of least resistance as it leaves the soil and enters the atmosphere.
On average, 1 out of every 15 homes in the US is estimated to have an elevated radon level. The risk of radon exposure varies by location. In the 1980s, it was determined that 6% of homes in the U.S. had elevated levels of radon. In contrast, 16% of homes in TN have elevated levels of radon. Today, it is known that portions of TN have even higher rates of radon than originally thought. Specifically, the counties of Davidson, Williamson and Rutherford are included in these areas. Brentwood is the only jurisdiction in TN where radon-resistant building techniques are used in all new construction.
ANSWER: HABITEC will conduct radon sampling using a Continuous Radon Monitor (CRM) or charcoal liquid scintillation (LS) canisters. Sampling and testing will be in accordance with a modified version of EPA guidelines, or equipment manufacturer guidelines, as applicable.
The CRM is preferred method for a number of reasons. First, the CRM is a scientific instrument that completes the test on site at the structure. The canisters must be sent in to a lab for analysis. Second, the CRM provides same day results. After the CRM is recovered from the site the information gathered by the CRM is downloaded to a computer for analysis and inclusion into a report. Results from the canisters must be sent back from the lab and this usually takes several days. Third, the CRM is tamper resistant. There are built-in monitors to note if the CRM was moved or if electrical power is disturbed from the monitor. You will not know if someone tampered with the canister.
HABITEC can safely and professionally sample the air in your home or building. That sample is then processed to see if radon is a concern for the structure. A written report is provided to the Client in a timely manner indicating the radon sampling and test results. Also, if the radon level in the structure exceeds EPA guidelines, HABITEC can suggest methods to mitigate the situation.
ANSWER: Several precautions must be exercised to insure a successful radon test. Most of these are presented to the property owner in a Closed House letter. Basically, the building must be maintained in a closed condition except for normal entry and exit. Doors and windows should remain closed and the HVAC system should be operated as it normally would. Placement of the test devices is important also. The radon measurement technician should be aware of all of these precautions.
ANSWER: The radon measurement technician should have been trained and certified in accordance with the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) protocol for radon measurement. NEHA also offers certification testing for radon measurement technicians. A list of certified radon measurement technicians is available on their website at www.radongas.org.
ANSWER: A reputable radon measurement technician will forward a report that includes tabular and bar graph representation of the radon test results in an hour-by-hour presentation. (Canister tests do not have this capability.) The technician should offer an explanation to help you interpret and understand the test results.
ANSWER: The test is not a pass/fail in the sense that something must be done. Your test results will be a number that indicates an average radon measurement in picocuries per liter (pCi/L). The EPA has established a recommended maximum indoor reading of 4 pCi/L. If your test results are equal to or greater than 4 pCi/L the EPA recommends mitigation to bring the level down. The EPA also says that NO value of radon measurement that exceeds the outdoor value should be considered acceptable.
ANSWER: Yes. Buildings built on a slab or basement are more likely to have higher radon readings than homes built on a crawl space. Crawl spaces usually have vents than provide a path of least resistance to radon so that the radon is less likely to enter the building. However, if these vents are closed (as some homeowners do in the winter to conserve heat) then buildings on a crawl space are similar to homes with a basement.
ANSWER: The cost of a radon test varies by the type of device used and whether or not the test is part of building inspection. CRM testing is usually a little more expensive than canister testing.
If anything cryptographic related is missing from here, submit a pull request to have it added. This package strive to be a cryptographic kitchen sink that provides cryptography for everyone.
Cryptonite is a haskell repository of cryptographic primitives. Each crypto algorithm has specificities that are hard to wrap in common APIs and types, so instead of trying to provide a common ground for algorithms, this package provides a non-consistent low-level API.
If you have no idea what you're doing, please do not use this directly. Instead, rely on higher level protocols or implementations.
Cryptonite APIs are stable, and we only strive to add, not change or remove. Note that because the API exposed is wide and also expose internals things (for power users and flexibility), certains APIs can be revised in extreme cases where we can't just add.
Each versions of stackage (going back 3 stable LTS) has a cryptonite version that we maintain with security fixes when necessary and are versioned with the following 0.x.y scheme.
Further platforms and architectures probably work too, but since the maintainer(s) don't have regular access to them, we can't commit to further support.

PSA - the group behind Peugeot, Citroen and DS cars - already has dealings with Opel and is now supplying the GM brand with components.
Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Autotrader: "Especially in light of Brexit, General Motors must do something with its European operations, which have long lost money and hold little hope for turning profitable anytime soon".
Bertrand Blaise, executive VP for corporate communications at Group PSA, is quoted by the news agency as saying, 'We are in discussions with Opel to expand upon our existing projects, ' but declined to comment further.
It would overtake Renault to become the second largest European carmaker, after Volkswagen. This potential sale is somewhat surprising given technology emanating from European operations (11% of GM '16 revenues), operational improvement in the region and potential disaggregation costs. The division has been an integral part of GM's history for almost 100 years, so untangling it won't be easy if a sale to PSA goes through.
"It may leave PSA stronger in Europe, but what this group really needs is a stronger presence outside Europe", Wells adds.
Vauxhall UK also has headquarters in Luton. But it also takes GM out of the ranks of global vehicle makers at a point when scale is more critical than ever.
A spokesman for PSA said it has been working with GM on three projects across Europe since 2012, which have delivered "substantial synergies" for both groups.
In a statement, PSA said it was exploring the "potential acquisition" of the business but there were now "no assurances that an agreement will be reached".

Our Kid Approved recipes have been tested out by our own children, one in grade school and one in high school. To receive our Kid Approved stamp, a prepared dish must be eaten and enjoyed by both our children. Healthy, fruit and vegetable filled meals are a great way to ensure children get the nutrients they need without all the fillers they don’t. We pride ourselves in avoiding unnecessary fillers and working our hardest to make everything we can from scratch. While we know it isn’t always feasible to make things from scratch (like juicing things every time you need a cup of OJ), we do believe in the importance of home cooked meals, eaten together around the table. Many of our recipes take minimal prep time and will be well worth it when you’re sharing a healthy homemade meal with your children.
Wow, these are AWESOME! I actually made my paleo blueberry muffins in a mini muffin tray so they’re nice little bite sized pieces. I have found that my family is much more likely to eat healthy when I hand them finger foods that require virtually zero preparation or thought to eat, haha. So that’s exactly what I did by making my muffins mini ones.
One of the reasons I have started really trying to get into different paleo breads, like these paleo blueberry muffins, is that we love bread. Not just me, but my husband and my children too. We all love bread. Breakfast is a poptart for our kids, unless we hand them something like these muffins (or our paleo banana bread) to eat instead. We are trying to instill healthy habits on our children. While we do allow our children to eat things we do not (some sugary things, candy, the poptarts of course), we do push healthy foods on them as much as possible and we try to limit their unhealthy food intake overall.
Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any good looking fresh blueberries today. So I used frozen ones that I already had in the freezer. I purchase large bags of organic frozen blueberries to make sure I never run out:)
Pure vanilla extract is Paleo, especially when baked, as the alcohol will bake off. However, artificial vanilla extract is NOT Paleo.
When making flatbread, it is important to keep an eye on it in the pan, and remember that it does take time. This isn’t instant, and turning up the burner heat is not going to help move things along. Be patient, let it cook, and when it puffs up, flip it!
No worries!!! This happens all the time. In a perfect world, each piece of flatbread would puff up when it’s time to flip it over, and every piece would always be absolute perfection. However, cooking is rarely perfect. Simply wait until the flatbread looks like it’s cooked through the center (not mushy anymore), then flip. You can always flip back if you need to 🙂 I have also had flatbread not puff up until it’s almost done. Sometimes there are also tiny holes in the bread, maybe from the batter not quite filling up that part of the pan, or from the batter sticking and tearing somehow. But these small holes and tears will cause your flatbread to stay flat while cooking, never puffing up.
Absolutely! We had some fantastic shredded chicken and lettuce flatbread sandwiches with our batch today. It was absolutely delicious! I also plan to use my Foreman Grill to make paninis with the leftover flatbread tomorrow for lunch.
This flatbread is also great ripped into bite sized pieces and dipped in a variety of sauces. A good guacamole or cream sauce is awesome with this bread!
Heat a pan over medium-high heat. You may need to use a little clarified butter (or ghee or olive oil) here if you aren't using a non-stick pan.
Once the pan is heated, scoop batter into the center of the pan. You can make these thick, like pancakes, or thin, like crepes.
Cooking time will vary based upon thickness of the batter. Once the batter puffs up or the batter in the center is no longer mushy (like watching a pancake cook), flip and cook the other side.
My family absolutely loves bread. And having a super easy Paleo sandwich bread recipe at our finger is extremely helpful. I don’t have a bread machine (even if I did, not sure where I would put it!), and I really needed a sandwich bread recipe that required minimal prep time. Well, now we have one!
It’s just really good… this is hubby approved bread!! Prep time for this bread is fairly minimal, and it slices perfectly when it’s done. I’ve made lots of breads in the past, and this one doesn’t fall apart when sliced thinly for sandwiches, which I find extremely important.
Gently fold wet ingredients into dry ingredients, mixing well. Don’t try to mix too quickly, go slowly. You want to end up with a nice consistent batter.
A wonderful mix of flavors, this honey lime sauce is absolutely incredible for dipping just about any fruit. It goes perfectly with our fruit summer rolls too!
The prep for this honey lime sauce is easy. Simply mix honey and lime juice. Another fantastic option for this recipe is to add a little fresh mint. The addition of some fresh mint completely changes the flavor of this honey lime sauce, making it taste extra refreshing!
I take our fruit summer rolls to parties and barbecues with this honey lime sauce for dipping. The dish is always a huge hit and I never walk away with leftovers, which is sometimes a bit of a bummer for me, haha. To have a great dish that isn’t too difficult and a great sauce to dip it in is just awesome. The honey lime sauce also goes great in the center of a tray with fresh fruit. Strawberries, cantaloupe, mango and apple chunks with toothpicks in them make for a great finger food for any occasion!
Much like our zucchini wrapped veggies, these cucumber wrapped veggies are fantastic for parties, barbecues, or just having at home for the family and kids.
The zucchini wrapped veggies aren’t all that fantastic when it comes to kids. The zucchini flavor just isn’t really what they’re into. These cucumber wraps are great with homemade ranch dressing!
The cucumber is a bit different than the zucchini when it comes to peeling. The center of a cucumber doesn’t hold together well when thinly peeled. What I do is peel one side of the cucumber almost to the center, then flip the cucumber and peel the other side, followed by the two remaining untouched sides. When I peel cucumbers this way, I end up with a rectangle of the inside leftover. I keep these to chop up and add to salads the next few days. No waste!
The prep work for this appetizer is not super clean. While I absolutely love all my pictures (and those I see on other cooking blogs), I also like to show some real prep pictures, with a little mess and the true looks of a used cutting board 🙂
