"Leadership for Learning: Personal Mastery and student-focused School Leadership across three European countries"
Research conducted e.g. by Marzano et al. (2005), Leithwood et al. (2006) and Louis et al. (2010) clearly show a (statistical) significant impact of school leadership on student achievement. Hattie (2008) analyses more than 800 meta-studies researching the influences on student achievement - one of his main findings is that the teacher is key to student success. However, Hattie (2015, p. 29) points out that teachers „need support, they need to collaborate with others in and across schools, they need to develop expertise, and they need excellent school leaders.“ In this exploratory research project the approaches of Personal Mastery (Senge 2006) and Theory U (Scharmer, 2009) serve as the underlying concepts to explore with mainly qualitative research methods successful schools in three European countries aiming specifically on school leaders: their way(s) to influence students and to learn more about what Scharmer (2009) calls the Inner Field of (school) leaders - the term Leadership will be associated throughout this research project as „being visionary, motivational, inspirational and innovative” (Schley & Schratz, 2011, p. 276) and is recognized as an attitude, Haltung, rather than an action (Schley & Schratz, 2005).
This research is carried out within the European Doctorate in Teacher Education (EDiTE), which is a four-year project supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, Marie-Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement number 676452

I am being so transparent in my process. I had this simple conversation with God. It went something like this–“God you did it for this one and that. I know that you can do the same. It happens so commonly for people –a shift–a change. A growth step into something new! You got this!”
The scripture says in every other translation apart from this one –“BE STILL and know that I am God!” The Message says–“Step out of the traffic! Take a long, loving look at Me!”
Traffic! Clutter! Bombarding thoughts of doubt. Fear. Torment. Disappointments. Worry. Step out of that place of frustration in your mind and bring yourself to a place to truly trust God by looking at Him. We have to focus on how He does things and within His timing, not ours. He is the owner of all things and above all things.
The same God that wrestled with Jacob is wrestling with you –to get you to a place where you are touched in a moment. This changes your perspective and pushes you to a realm of complete faith! We are convinced!
We can stand fearless. This is our safe place. Our safe house. When life starts to roar at us we need to step out of that noise to a quiet place with Him.

Our mind is an awesome and incredible weapon. It can also be so damn destructive. After all, Charles Swindoll coined, “Life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react.”
A man traveling late at night through the Midwest cornfields blows out a tire. He cusses as he hops out onto the dark, desolate road and saunters back to the shredded tire. Knowing that he lent his spare tire to a friend, he feels trapped. It’s 11pm. He’s out in the boonies. He starts to get concerned.
“How the hell am I going to get out of this one?” he thought as he looked at his phone, which seemingly taunted him with, “No service.” He began searching for his options. A light on a small farmhouse shone about three quarters of a mile away. “I hope someone is there who can help me,” he mumbled to himself as he began the trek down the old road.
He continued, “If someone is there, I hope they answer the door. It is late and they don’t know me.”
As he made it halfway there he thought, “Man, the way my day has been going. I bet they’re not going to answer the door. What am I going to do in this Godforsaken place? My tire is busted out. My phone has no service. I’m screwed.”
As he reached the head of the driveway, the second floor’s lights went dim. “I knew it,” he thought, “there is no way they are going to help me.” He began to get more animated and agitated as he broke into a jog up the winding, dirt driveway.
By the time he reached the door, his temperature had risen. He was sweaty. He was angry. He banged on the door. No answer. He kept banging on the door yelling, “I know you are in there. I saw you turn out the lights.”
Finally, the porch light flipped on. As the door opened, an old man appeared in his bathrobe. Before the old man could say a word, the man with the flat tire reeled back and punched him in the nose.
When we write a story that hasn’t yet happened, we bring all our baggage forward, weighed down by the experiences, hopes, disappointments and fears of the past. As a result, we limit future possibilities to only the ones we imagine. Yet, there are so many more possibilities in life.
Think about the story. The old man never had a chance. He opened the door, maybe ready to get out of bed, put on clothes and help, but the man with the flat tire had convinced himself – solely in his own mind by applying his own value filter on the situation – that the man was not going to help. As a result, he punched him in the nose. He wrote a story that had not yet been written.
“It’s all who you know.” Well, there are plenty of people who started out not knowing anyone. But, if you wrote that story, you would be doomed. There would be no point and no reason to start the journey to do the work to succeed.
“She won’t say, ‘Yes.’” You’ll never get the date of your dreams unless you ask. How do you know what he/she will say unless you ask the question? You don’t know someone else’s path, so don’t answer for them. Trust me. I know this one from experience. Right, Rachel? 🙂
“I’m not smart enough.” Everything can be learned with enough time and effort. Believing the story of “cannot” means that you “will not.” You will not even try. Yet, all of us start the journey to knowledge with incompetence – and somehow build competence.
When you write a story that hasn’t yet happened, your mind begins to believe it. Once you believe it, the mind adopts it as fact – whether it happened or not. This limits your ability to write your own unique, creative story through action.
Let’s be clear. There is a critical difference between planning and preparation and writing the story that hasn’t yet happened. Preparation is simply ripening your mind to accept the many results that could occur. Writing the story assumes that it has already occurred. Preparation creates openness whereas writing the story limits possibilities. One creates power the other creates destruction.
When we close ourselves off, we only allow a fraction of our world to appear. Think about the three pieces of your world:
What you don’t know, you don’t know (I have no idea about this existence, possibility or opportunity)
The first two parts are fractional pieces of the world and truly a subset of the world we have experienced so far. The third is the much larger, unknown world to us. If you are not open, you are blind – and will always be blind – to all the things you don’t know, you don’t know. That’s huge!
The real battle for success here is to be present & open to opportunities. Before you say, “I can’t do that” or “I can’t help myself to jump in,” first stop telling yourself a story about what you can and can’t do. And, second, recognize that being present and open is a mindset skill that can be developed and honed (four stages of skill development). Here are three guiding thoughts that will help you develop this skill:
Put your pen away. Molly Fletcher said it right, “To be fearless, you must be curious and vulnerable to possibilities.” Writing a story creates mental comfort (“I know how this will end, so I don’t have to try.”), but it also closes possibilities. In other words, to experience the fullness of the world, you can’t always be in control. You must be present in the moment and open to experience it for yourself.
Respond, don’t react. Have you ever witnessed a reactionary argument that positively built relationships and solved problems? I haven’t. A reaction is created from an unwritten future state – an expectation of something that hasn’t happened; responding stays present trying to solve the issue. Stay open and present.
Seek First to Understand, then to be Understood (Habit 5, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People). When we genuinely stay in the moment to understand another’s point of view, we stay open to possibilities. We stop jumping to conclusions or interjecting our own value filter onto the conversation. Restraint to listen, clarify and understand places you squarely in a position of power. And, that power resides in being open to a world of possibilities – places of personal blind spots we have never considered because our own experiences have yet to take us there.
Instead of writing the story that hasn’t yet happened, be present in the one that is happening. Learn to breathe your way through the moments where you feel compelled to interject and jump to conclusions. Live your life without the prejudice and weight of a world that doesn’t yet exist. Seek truly to understand before you form your view of the future. And then, respond to it as it comes.
Take control. Stop walking around punching people in the nose simply because you’ve told yourself a story that hasn’t happened. And, what you’ll unlock is real personal power.

The study aims to contribute and further the current international discussion on general pedagogical knowledge (GPK) in teacher education (TE). In an era of accountability, benchmarking and professional competence both nationally and internationally, teachers’ pedagogical knowledge (PK) is of significant research interest for international organisations (e.g. OECD). This has in part, derived from research on teaching and learning which support the assumption that what teachers know, do and believe, has an impact on the quality of teaching and student achievement (Hill et al, 2005, Voss et al, 2011; Darling-Hammond, 2000) and that making effective pedagogical decisions is highly attributed to the pedagogical knowledge of the teacher (Guerriero, 2015). Whilst large scale studies have sought to operationalise and empirically define GPK (Voss & Kunter, 2013; Baumert at al, 2010), research in this area is still in its infancy Furthermore, it could be argued that an economic based approach, which measures teacher knowledge, narrows the scope of research towards prescriptive and restrictive professional competence indicators. This research seeks to move away from the dominant competence oriented operationalisations of GPK and pre-defined parameters and definitions of GPK. Equally this research is of pivotal importance and highly relevant for the fundamental teacher education curriculum reform in Austria, which places more emphasis on content related to specific pedagogical knowledge.
-What are teachers’ personal understandings and constructs of general pedagogical knowledge compared to and in relation to large-scale comparative approaches?
-What role does pedagogical knowledge play in dealing with diversity in the professional field of teaching?
A co-evolutionary inductive and reconstructive theory building process is adopted, which takes into account both the complexity and fluid development of GPK in the teaching profession and steps back from predefined parameters and (expressly competence oriented) definitions of GPK. Consequently a primarily qualitative reconstructive empirical approach is employed which focuses on interviewing experts from the field. The empirical findings from the interviews will form the basis for discussion regarding the reconceptualisation of GPK and potential consequences for initial teacher education.
One thing that has turned many people off about binary options online robots is the fact that many of them promise trade results that are all hype and no substance. How can a trader deposit $250 into an account and hope to walk away with hundreds of thousands of dollars after just a month of trading? We all know this cannot happen. The team at BinaryRobot365 also knows this, and that is why this robot was created differently. BinaryRobot365 is here to give you automated binary options online trading with real results and no hype.
BinaryRobot365 is a binary options online robot software developed in August 2016 by ARG Media, a UK-based company. The software is created as a third-party application, built to trade the High/Low binary options online contracts on the platforms of compatible brokers. BinaryRobot365 sets trades on the regular High/Low binary options online as well as the Turbo/Hyper options which have expiry times that last only as long as 2 minutes or 5 minutes. BinaryRobot365 was voted Best Robot 2016 by a poll of users of robot software conducted online.
What are the assets that can be traded by the BinaryRobot365 software? We look to one of the platforms where this software regularly produces profits to pick out the assets that are listed for trading with the High/Low as well as Turbo options:
BinaryRobot365 on its own, does not provide trading bonuses to its users. Bonuses are rather available on some of the brokerage platforms that are compatible with the BinaryRobot365 software. Bonuses are provided on the following platforms:
It is possible to trade with BinaryRobot365 on mobile. Apart from being able to run on the mobile apps of the brokerage platforms on which the software trades, it is also possible to use BinaryRobot365 on the mobile versions of the platforms on which it runs. The BinaryRobot365 app website itself is mobile-compliant, and allows traders to adjust risk settings and perform other software-related functions.
In order to use the BinaryRobot365 robot or app, the trader must make a minimum deposit of $250 into a trading account that is to be opened with any of the brokers listed above. Each broker has its own unique system of accepting deposits and effecting withdrawals. Some of the popular methods of transaction are as follows:
Credit card/debit card: Different brokers will provide a mandate of what cards can be used and who can use them.
The bank wire transfer method is used by all brokers and accepts all citizens of countries they do business with. Usually, traders are advised to take advantage of the higher transfer limits allowed with the bank wire method.
E-wallet options: Several of the binary options online brokers that are compatible with BinaryRobot365 also allow Skrill and other digital wallets.
Here is a list of the minimum deposit amounts in the various base currencies that feature on BinaryRobot365.
Once a deposit has been made, the BinaryRobot365 software is ready for instant activation by the trader. The trader can then make the necessary risk setting adjustments before switching on the robot for trading.
BinaryRobot365 has a strong customer support system which allows users, prospects and affiliates get help with any issues they may have. What customer service channels can traders and prospects alike utilize on BinaryRobot365? The following channels are available:
BinaryRobot365 presents some extra features not usually found on other binary options online robots. Some of these are listed below.
Traders get access to a free binary options online demo account. This is a very rare provision for binary options online robots. Test the performance of BinaryRobot365 on a preferred broker’s platform before you sign up.
Usage of BinaryRobot365 is free. What is the catch here? The software’s developers are eventually paid a portion of trading commissions from trades it places.
BinaryRobot365 is a relatively new binary options online robot, but has quickly established itself as a genuine software that produces believable and valid results without resorting to hype, hiring of paid actors or fake testimonials.
BinaryRobot365 boasts of an exceptional customer service desk. Many binary options online robots websites do not provide contacts through which their team can be reached. BinaryRobot365 is different. You can reach the team behind the software using live chat, email and telephone.
BinaryRobot365 is the first software to trade binary options online contracts on cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum.

We now feature some of the frequently asked questions that traders and prospective users may have about the BinaryRobot365 software. Here they are:
Answer: The BinaryRobot365 software is free to use. You only need to make an initial deposit of $250 with one of the listed brokers. You fund and withdraw your profits as the software works on your account.
Answer: Yes, some of the listed brokers that BinaryRobot365 works on present cryptocurrencies for trading. You need to sign up with the specific broker(s) that offer this from the list. More guidance on this is provided by the BinaryRobot365 team.
As part of the sign up process on BinaryRobot365, you will be directed to a page to sign up with one of the brokers whose platforms are compatible with BinaryRobot365. You can then deposit funds with your chosen broker using the means of transaction offered on the broker’s platform.
BinaryRobot365 does not accept third-party payments. All deposits and withdrawals must emanate and terminate on the account owner’s payment channel, bearing the same name as the BinaryRobot365 trading account owner.
BinaryRobot365 is not a scam robot. It is a tested and trusted binary options online robot which is very legit. It does not promise you millions, but it can give you a nice side income.

Then pick another print and repeat. Over and over and over again. It's amazing how when playing said game, the quality of your canter will improve -- it has to to be able to consistently meet the spots...

I'm just a dabbler. I like to try my hand at everything- you name it I'll try it! Now, I'm not claiming to be the best, or even good at the things I try, but it's a learning process right! This blog is all about my trial and errors, so we all can make beautiful things!
After cutting them out, I used the thin 'blanket stitch' on my machine. I then just sewed the hood on, and then the body. (If you would rather you can hot glue them together.)
Using a fine tip permanent marker, I drew on the faces. The angel and wisemen are decorated with glitter glue.
I stumbled upon your blog from a friends. . .I would LOVE this pattern as this Christmas will be our baby's first (due July 6th). How do I need to get in contact with you? Thanks.
You can contact me through email, eneville4517 (at) msn (dot) com. i also left my email on your blog since I didn't know if you would get this. Let me know where to send the pattern, it's one piece of paper and the directions are all on line. Hope to hear from you soon.
I would love the pattern for your finger puppets. They are so cute. I bought a small 5 piece set for my girls and they love them, but I think I need to add a few characters.
A social work major with an overwhelmingly maternal heart, this girl knows how to love and she does that by emulating the love of her true Father, “I think human beings are most empowered by the knowledge that we are loved, and who loves us better than our Father. If we look at ourselves through the eyes of God we can realize our own goodness as His beloved, and we are encouraged to use the gifts he has given us to love his people.” For Brigid, it’s when giving of herself that she finds herself and that is truly something to behold. “He has given me this heart to serve and this heart that loves with an absolute reckless abandon that can be pretty overwhelming at times, and he wants me to use it to love his children and draw people closer to Him. I am called to give my heart to Him and to allow Him to use me as a channel of his peace, his love, and his passion.” In John Paul II’s Theology of the Body he speaks of ‘all is gift,’ which is this idea that all of creation is a gift to man (a gift that Adam + Eve took for granted) and we must be living every single day as a gift if we wish to align our hearts back to His, “I have found that the best way to let Him into my life, even when I’m struggling, is through gratitude. If I am aware of the little moments and gifts that He gives me through the people and things around me, like the laughter of a friend or the beauty of a sunset, then I can really start to live my life with Him.” Living in gratitude of our Creator is in our very nature and once we live into that then God can radically start acting in your life, “Through my gratitude, it begins to feel so natural to invite Him into all of the aspects of life, and I see a freedom in the way I pray and in the way I encounter others – so open to whatever they may bring to me because I know that I am greeting them with Christ.”
I have spoken a lot on this blog about our desperate need for a community of women in each one of our lives. We all need women to hold us up, call us out, and love us beyond all our faults. We all need a woman who is recklessly running towards Christ without abandon. Maybe you’re that person for your friends, maybe you know who that is in your life or maybe you haven’t quite found her yet. I waited a long time to have that woman in my life and that woman is Brigid, “While my softness is in so many ways my strength when it comes to loving people, I see that my wildness draws people into the home of my heart as well. There is an incredible power in the fact that the feminine heart knows no bounds when it is nurtured by the love of Christ.”
One of my favorite aspects of Brigid is the way that she loves women so so much. She is so focused on ridding her life of comparison and envy with other women and simply loving them and that has inspired me like you couldn’t imagine. What I think is interesting is how this loving view of women has affected her view on modesty, “I really have grown to dislike the word modest because of the negative connotations of hiding and shame that have developed as part of the culture of modesty. Women are so so beautiful and it is good for their beauty to be seen and appreciated – as anything beautiful is glorifying God.”
We are reducing our feminine power to something that is purely physical, not something that is highly intellectual, spiritual, and emotional.
So, how does she dress in a way that glorifies her Creator? “When I dress, I, of course, want to look beautiful, but in a way that invites people into conversation with me, in a way that intrigues. When we use our bodies instead to entice or manipulate, we are doing a great injustice to ourselves and the people around us by eliminating an entire level of human connection. We are reducing our feminine power to something that is purely physical, not something that is highly intellectual, spiritual, and emotional.” I pray that everyone has someone like Brigid in their lives as an example of a woman who is wild and free and running towards Christ with everything she has. If you haven’t found that woman yet, pray unceasingly and be willing to wait because after 4 years of praying for her God has finally answered that prayer.

RAPID CITY, S.D. (AP) - An Iraq war veteran convicted of assaulting a Rapid City police officer has been sentenced to serve a little less than a year in jail.
Thirty-year-old Delano Eagle faced up to five years in prison for the Feb. 26 incident after being found guilty last month of simple assault on a police officer and resisting arrest and pleading guilty to third-offense drunken driving.
The Rapid City Journal reports that Judge Mary Thorstenson said she agonized over the sentence because Eagle suffered a head injury in Iraq and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She sentenced him to 300 days behind bars and five years of probation, with a warning that any further criminal activity or alcohol abuse would land him in the State Penitentiary.

Cam is nominated for Best Country Solo Performance at the 2016 Grammy Awards, but she didn't learn the good news in a traditional way, like from a formal letter or a visit to the Grammy website, she tells Taste of Country Nights.
The "Burning House" singer learned she's up for a Grammy because her phone wouldn't stop buzzing when the nominees were announced!
“Isn’t it funny that you find out because people just text you?” Cam tells us after being congratulated.
“I guess they all get up really early and check that site or something. I don’t even know. I haven’t been to the site so I just hope everyone’s correct,” she adds with a laugh.
Indeed, the singer's impressive vocal delivery on "Burning House" earned her a spot on the ballot. The song has done wonders for the newcomer's career — it's even her first Top 10 hit! However, it won't be Cam's first time to attend the Grammys.
She shares that someone got her tickets to the event roughly four or five years ago, but this year will obviously be much different, since she's nominated. Last time, she sat "way in the back. We watched and I remember being like, ‘That’s gonna be me one day,’ but like everybody sits there and says, ‘That’s gonna be me one day,’ so it’s kind of crazy that — that is going to be me in February."
The 2016 Grammy Awards show takes place at L.A.'s Staples Center on Feb. 15. Cam's new album, Untamed, is out Dec. 11, and she's also expected to get married in the coming year.

A superfood broccoli salad packed with nutrition! You’ve got tender broccoli florets, tons of cranberries, nuts, and seeds all drizzled with the most addicting creamy poppy seed dressing!
You know the one with all that bacon, mayo, and cheddar. The kind of broccoli salad that left you feeling quite the opposite of what one assumes they’ll feel when they eat something with that much broccoli in it. I imagine we all hold our heads up a little higher and bask in the afterglow of eating healthy food. Like the Seth Rogen meme. The one where he’s looking over his shoulder, I know you’ve seen it before. 😂
Today’s superfood salad recipe is one that you can feel healthy as heck about eating, and I imagine it’s one that you’ll come back to over and over again this spring and summer season. Speaking of summer, we bought a patio dining furniture this weekend, on a whim! All I wanted to do was head to the store, daydream a little and then face the reality that it wasn’t something we needed as we just wouldn’t get enough use out of it. Things didn’t go exactly as planned. The store had such amazing deals that appealed to my super picky, neutral-loving style that before I could think it through, we were handing over the credit card. Take my money! When it came time to load everything into the car, that’s when it hit me. Um.. how is this even going to fit?
We’re hoping to have it set up soon so that we get tons of use out of it before temperatures are turned up to the ‘roast’ setting. And you can bet that this broccoli salad is going to be on my outdoor dining table from now until the end of summer.
Color, texture, and crunch – it’s got it all. I’m still in awe of this salad because we’ve had it close to six times now and every single time I have it, I think this is it. This is the time I’m going to say I’ll hold off on making this salad again. It still shocks me how good it is, and I’m back to making it every few days. It’s perfect for days when you need to throw together something quick that’s full of nutrition and will keep you full for lunch or as a side with dinner.
This salad is a feast for the eyes before it’s one for the belly. If you’re bored of eating the same mundane salads day in and day out, this one is a great alternative. It also contains zero leafy greens. Although you could quick chop some kale or spinach and toss it in if that’s something you enjoy. All those beautiful gem tones coming together on a salad plate. Crunchy broccoli, tender quinoa, and creamy poppyseed dressing.
Let me tell you about this easy breezy creamy poppyseed dressing. Like I said, no dairy products here. We’re using olive oil, honey, white wine vinegar, a chopped shallot, poppy seeds — and the secret ingredient, a rounded tablespoon of white miso paste! There is zero weirdness with the miso, and it has the best, almost umami-like flavor and makes it extra luscious and creamy. If you’re someone that enjoys making homemade dressing, just double this one right off the bat. I’m telling you, you’re going to wish you had more on hand for other salads throughout the week.
It lasts in the fridge for what is considered light years in salad times. Toss the salad ingredients together and keep the dressing on the side, add it to the salad as you need it!
If you’re a broccoli salad purist, adding crumbled bacon and/or cheddar cheese to this will ease it back into the more traditional version while still keeping it on the healthier side.
MEAL PREP. This one is perfect for meal prepping for the week. Pop it into those single compartment (affiliate link) meal prep containers along with a condiment container (affiliate link) with dressing in it. I recently just invested in dressing containers and they do wonders for your salad meal prepping game.
My broccoli salad is one of those rare salads that taste better as they sit, so if you’re serving this later in the day or for lunch the next day, feel free to dress it and pack it for lunch. Anything longer than a day will naturally cause the broccoli to release water thus making it a less than perfect salad experience.
And there you have it! An uncomplicated, protein and veggie packed superfood broccoli salad recipe that you can feel good about eating.
A superfood broccoli salad packed with nutrition! You’ve got tender broccoli florets, tons of cranberries, nuts, and seeds all drizzled with the most addicting creamy poppyseed dressing!
Dressing: Combine all the ingredients for the dressing in a food processor starting with 3 tablespoons of honey and a big pinch of salt and pepper. Blend until the dressing is smooth. Taste and adjust with additional honey or salt and pepper as desired. I prefer this one with around 3½ tablespoons of honey.
Broccoli Salad: Steam the broccoli if you’d like, I did because I wanted it to have a more vibrant color. Combine the ingredients for the salad in a large bowl. Dress the entire salad if you’ll finish it all within 24 hours. Otherwise, mix just what you need and keep the two separate, they’ll last much longer this way.
This makes just enough dressing for this salad. If you usually prefer your salad with lots of dressing, you may want to double it. It’s so good you can easily use it on other salads too!
Feel free to add grilled chicken or cooked salmon to this. Crumbled bacon and cheddar cheese are also additions that can easily be made 😉

"Constructing cultural diversity: teachers's perceptions, classroom strategies and school mechanisms in urban Portugal/Austria"
Nikolett’s area in her PhD study is cultural diversity in European schools, more particularly in urban environments of Portugal and Austria. The EDiTE pillars (Emerging Europe, Transformative Teacher Learning and Better Student Learning) frame her work as she emphasizes the role of teacher learning for cultural diversity in a multicultural Europe, where current discriminatory discourses might threaten equitable education for all school children. Additionally, Nikolett finds it important to understand teachers’ realities working in multicultural schools, as a starting point to design adequate teacher learning opportunities, and consequently, improve education in urban contexts.
Nikolett’s main research questions are 1) How is cultural diversity conceptualized by school practitioners? 2) What are the strategies teachers apply in addressing cultural diversity in the classroom? 3) What are the mechanisms the schools develop as a learning organization to respond to cultural diversity? Nikolett applies the lenses of critical multiculturalism when analyzing these issues. She utilizes multiple qualitative methods to collect data: school documents, semi-structured interviews as well as ethnographic classroom observations constitute the data base of the case studies. A constructivist grounded theory approach guides her research, with a special focus on situational analysis in order to understand the processes involved in constructing cultural diversity as well as exploring their underlying reasons.
"Struggling for Educational Justice in Disabling Societies - A Cross Cultural Ethnography of Inclusive Schooling Practices in Poland, Austria, and Germany"
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (UN-CRPD, 2006) has pushed countries across the European Union to reconsider and tackle the social and institutional barriers that prevent people with disabilities from full and equal participation in their societies.Hence, the question of how to accomplish educational justice through creating inclusive mainstream schooling has risen to top relevance in countries whose educational systems rely heavily on the segregation of able and disabled bodied children. The aim of my dissertation is to conduct an in-depth comparative cross-cultural ethnographic study of changes in learning and teaching in European schools, which are undergoing intense processes of institutional transformation resulting from both economic and policy-level changes affecting educational systems. The methodological approach to school studies is based on the fundamental paradigm of educational anthropology that treats the schooling process as a “cultural production of an educated person” (Spindler, 2000; Erickson, 1984, 2010). Since culture is “not a power, something to which social events, behaviors, institutions, or processes can be causally attributed to”, my doctoral research will be attempting to analyse the educational contexts that I encounter, based on long-term ethnographic studies in schools in Poland, Austria and Germany. Ultimately, I aim to present a "thick description" (Geertz, 1973, p. 10) of how schools struggle with the realities of inclusion, challenging existing concepts of teacher professionalism and student learning as a part of larger changes in school cultures, illuminating through attention to micro-level manifestations large-scale processes of change across Europe. My research is situated in all three strands of the EDiTE framework. It contributes a perspective on the emerging European future by analysing three European educational country contexts in the design of ethnographic case studies, i.e. deeply contextualised school research carried out in Poland, Austria and Germany.It focuses on excluding and including classroom practices which sheds light on chances for developing transformative teacher learning on the one hand, and better student learning, on the other. My cross-cultural study will ultimately comment on the state of educational justice in European societies.
"Europeanisation in Teacher Education: A Comparative Study of Teacher Education Policies and Practices in Austria, Greece and Hungary"
During the last decade, an accelerating process of Europeanisation of national policies related to teachers and teacher education has been witnessed (EDiTE, 2014), so that researchers are currently talking about a ‘European teacher education policy community’ (Hudson-Zgaga, 2008) and the ‘European teacher’ (Schratz, 2014).
This study, conducted within the framework of the European Doctorate in Teacher Education (EDiTE), aims to analyse the process of Europeanisation in the field of teacher education from an international comparative perspective, exploring how and to what extent teacher education policies and practices in three European countries (Austria, Greece, and Hungary) have been influenced by contemporary European policy and research developments. Teacher education is examined by looking at policies and practices related to the following dimensions: (a) the creation of a continuum of teacher professional development, meaning an overarching unity between initial teacher education, induction and continuing professional development; (b) the definition and use of teacher competences; and (c) the support of teacher educators.
Acknowledging the complexity of policy flows, the study examines perspectives of various actors in different levels of policy implementation, adopting a comparative and embedded case study design. Firstly, the study looks at the international level to explore how Europeanisation emerged in the field of teacher education, considering global trends and the economically driven approach to education. Analysis at this level offers a mapping tool with indicators to help us study teacher education at the national level. Secondly, the study examines through “thick description” (Geertz, 1973) recent reforms and policy initiatives in three European countries to trace potential influences of Europeanisation at the national level and identify the actors and mechanisms involved in this process. Finally, sub-cases of individual higher education institutions and schools aim to illustrate the microdynamics at the institutional and local level. To this end, the study employs content analysis of official documents, interviews with international and national policy experts, as well as interviews with teacher educators and teachers.
As part of EDiTE, the specific study contributes to research in the broader field of Europeanisation and the specific field of teacher education, developing further the discussion of what constitutes the ‘Europeanness’ of teacher education. The study will also bring concrete knowledge about each country’s teacher education system and will help policy-makers to better understand the field which they try to shape.
"Selection and use of classroom materials in a social studies classroom: toward transformative emancipatory education"
Classroom materials, such as textbooks, are an important part of the context in which learners and teachers work. Textbooks have become a critical source for studying reforms in schools and are one of the main sources for the content and the pedagogical methods used in classrooms. Despite the important role of textbooks, few empirical studies have been conducted on the use of textbooks in class.
Working within a critical education framework and believing in the social aim of education in an increasingly market-driven approach to learning and the role of teachers as agents of change, this study attempts to explore the potential of transformative approaches to materials in the area of social studies in a way that sustain a democratic society and is inclusive of all voices. The research will examine examples of innovative and critical approaches to materials used in Social Studies and Citizenship Education courses in two European countries: Austria and Portugal, and the implication of that on transformative learning and social change.

Every adult moves through several important and predictable stages in their career-life journey, with the ending of one stage and the beginning of the next involving a period of adjustment.
In his well-known book Transitions, William Bridges explains that transitions involve 1) an ending, followed by 2) a period of confusion and distress, leading to 3) a new beginning. He warns us that the transition process can take its' "toll on us physically as well as mentally and socially."
Current adult stages are believed to be young adults (22-34), early middle age (35-44), late middle age (45-64), young-old (65-75), middle-old (76-85) and frail old (86+). A career-life transition can take place at any one of these stages, including late stages since people are living to advanced ages and often working in paid roles into their 70's and 80's.
The factors listed below can impact the experience and outcome of a career-life transition. Use the questions to help support and inform your transition process.
Timing/Readiness: Does the change fit with your stage of life? Does the change involve embarking on a whole new life chapter, e.g. adolescence to adulthood, entering late middle age, or middle-old age? Are you ready for the change, or does it feel forced or premature? What do you need to do to prepare yourself for what lies ahead? What might you need to let go of? What supports do you have in place to ease you through the transition?
Imposed or Self-Selected: Is the change your idea, or has someone or something influenced or forced the transition you face? This could include termination of employment, the sudden ending of a relationship through divorce, death or illness. You need to have resources in place whether you have chosen to engage in something new or it's been forced upon you.
Role Adjustment: Roles include behavioural expectations created by ourselves and/or by others. When we leave one life stage and enter another, there are always role adjustments. In the new role, the expectations may be inflated, imposed or unrealistic. The loss of the previous role may create emotional distress. Working through that distress until the new role "fits" is critical. And perhaps most importantly the time required can vary a great deal, depending on the individual.
Establishing A New Identity: This can take a fair bit of time, depending on the amount of "reinvention" that's required. So much of our identity is defined by how we earn a living. Trying out new roles on a small scale, e.g. taking a part-time job in the field, or volunteering can allow one to adjust to the new identity. Changing work identity involves learning to think about oneself differently. In my own journey, after launching a private practice in career counselling, it took me nearly five years to refer to myself as a psychotherapist.
Building New Relationships: Leaving old friends/colleagues behind and joining a new group can be a difficult adjustment. Entering college or university is one example. Changing occupational fields is another, or getting married and moving to a new community, city or country. Adjusting to retirement can be highly distressing for some people. Any of these changes may involve the loss of some relationships and require the building and maintaining of new ones.The mental and social toll can be significant depending on your personality and the support systems you have in place.
In my own career journey, one of the most difficult transitions I experienced was from my first career in the secretarial field to that of full-time wife and parent. The ending of the paid work role was not difficult, as the planned birth of our first child totally trumped my previous career choice! All my life I had imagined the joy of becoming a parent and that part definitely did not disappoint me. What I could not have known was the reality of how much the homemaking role is under valued in our culture. Nor could I have ever imagined the negative impact on my psychological health of being in a role without value: strong feelings of being invisible and worthless as a "stay at home mom."
I invite you to make a list of the number of career transitions you've had in your life thus far. Use some of the questions in this article as the basis for your self-assessment and reflection.
Consider this tiny piece of wisdom - ask for and accept the support you need to help you move forward. Career transitions are so much better when they're not navigated alone.
Abstract Of Title A summary of the public records relating to the title to a particular piece of land. An attorney or title insurance company reviews an abstract of title to determine whether there are any title defects which must be cleared before a buyer can purchase clear, marketable, and insurable title.
Acceleration Clause Condition in a mortgage that may require the balance of the loan to become due immediately. This may occur if regular mortgage payments are not made or for breach of other conditions of the mortgage.
Adjustment Interval On an adjustable rate mortgage, the time between changes in the interest rate and/or monthly payment, typically six months, one, three, or five years, depending on the mortgage terms.
Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) A variable or flexible rate mortgage with an interest rate that adjusts periodically according to the financial index it is based upon plus a margin. To limit the borrower¹s risk, the ARM may have a payment or rate cap.
Annual Percentage Rate (APR) The cost of credit expressed as an annual rate. It must be calculated by using a formula set by federal law and disclosed to the borrower to aid in comparing different credit plans.
Application A printed form used by a mortgage lender to record necessary information concerning a prospective mortgage.
Application Fee A sum of money paid towards estimated initial mortgage processing expenses such as appraisal and credit report.
As Separate Property Ownership in real property which is to be specifically excluded from community property.
Assessed Valuation The value that a taxing authority places on real or personal property for the purpose of taxation.
Assessment Charges levied against a property for tax purposes or to pay for municipality or association improvements such as curbs, sewers, or grounds maintenance.
Assumption of Mortgage An obligation undertaken by the purchaser of property to be personally liable for payment of an existing mortgage. In an assumption, the purchaser is substituted for the original mortgagor in the mortgage instrument and the original mortgagor is to be released from further liability in the assumption, the mortgagee's consent is usually required.
The original mortgagor should always obtain a written release from further liability if he desires to be fully released under the assumption. Failure to obtain such a release renders the original mortgagor liable if the person assuming the mortgage fails to make the monthly payments.
An "Assumption of Mortgage" is often confused with "purchasing subject to a mortgage." When one purchases subject to a mortgage, the purchaser agrees to make the monthly mortgage payments on an existing mortgage, but the original mortgagor remains personally liable if the purchaser fails to make the monthly payments. Since the original mortgagor remains liable in the event of default, the mortgagee's consent is not required to a sale subject to a mortgage.
Both "Assumption of Mortgage" and "Purchasing Subject to a Mortgage" are used to finance the sale of property. They may also be used when a mortgagor is in financial difficulty and desires to sell the property to avoid foreclosure.
Balloon Mortgage A mortgage that has level monthly payments which are insufficient to amortize the loan so that a balloon, or lump sum payment is due at the end of the term. Frequently, balloon mortgages contain an opportunity to refinance when the balloon payment is due.
Bankruptcy A proceeding in a federal court in which a debtor (who owes more than his/her assets or cash flow) is relieved from the payment of debts. This can affect the borrower's personal liability or the mortgage debt but not the lien of a mortgage.
Basis Points Used to describe mortgage yield, one basis point equals one 100th of 1% or 0.01%. A mortgage yield increase from 9.50 to 9.75% is an increase of 25 basis points.
Binder or "Offer to Purchase" A preliminary agreement, secured by the payment of earnest money, between a buyer and seller as an offer to purchase real estate. A binder secures the right to purchase real estate upon agreed terms for a limited period of time. If the buyer changes his mind or is unable to purchase, the earnest money is forfeited unless the binder expressly provides that it is to be refunded.
Blanket Mortgage A mortgage covering at least two pieces of real estate as security for the same mortgage.
Borrower (Mortgagor) One who applies for and receives a loan in the form of a mortgage with the intention of repaying the loan in full.
Bridge Loan A loan, usually a second mortgage, that is collateralized by the borrower's present home (that is usually for sale).
Building Line of Setback Distances from the ends and/or sides of the lot beyond which construction may not extend. The building line may be established by a filed plat of subdivision, by restrictive covenants in deeds or leases, by building codes, or by zoning ordinances.
Buy-Down Where the buyer pays additional discount points in return for a below market interest rate; or the buyer or seller deposits sufficient funds with the lender to reduce the rate during the first one to three years of the loan; or pays closing costs such as the origination fee. During times of high interest rates, buy-downs may induce buyers to purchase property they may not otherwise have purchased.
Cap A limit on how much an adjustable rate mortgage's monthly payment or annual interest rate can increase. A cap is meant to protect the borrower from large increases and may be a payment cap, an interest cap, a life-of- loan cap or periodic cap. A payment cap is a limit on the monthly payment. An interest cap is a limit on the amount of the interest rate. A life-a-loan cap restricts the amount the interest rate can increase over entire term of the loan. A periodic cap limits the amount the interest rate can change each interest rate adjustment date.
Cash to Close Liquid assets that are readily available to be used to pay the closing costs involved in a closing of a mortgage transaction.
Certificate of Title A certificate issued by a title company or a written opinion rendered by an attorney that the seller has good marketable and insurable title to the property which he is offering for sale. A certificate of title offers no protection against any hidden defects in the title which an examination of the records could not reveal. The issuer of a certificate of title is liable only for damages due to negligence. The protection offered a homeowner under a certificate of title is not as great as that offered in a title insurance policy.
Certificate of Occupancy (CO) Written authorization given by a local municipality that allows a newly completed or substantially completed structure to be inhabited - not to be confused with "Notice of Completion."
Certificate of Reasonable Value (CRV) A Veteran's Administration appraisal that establishes the maximum VA mortgage loan amount for a specified property.
Certificate of Title Document rendering an opinion on the status of a property's title based on public records.
Closed End Mortgage A mortgage principal amount that is fixed and cannot be increased during the life of the loan.
Closing Costs The numerous expenses which buyers and sellers normally incur to complete a transaction in the transfer of ownership of real estate. These costs are in addition to price of the property and are items prepaid at the closing day. This is a typical list: Buyer's Expenses
The agreement of sale negotiated previously between the buyer and the seller may state in writing who will pay each of the above costs.
Closing A transaction in which the formalities of a real estate sale are concluded. The certificate of title, abstract, and deed are generally prepared for the closing by an attorney and this cost charged to the buyer. The buyer signs the mortgage, and closing costs are paid. The final closing merely confirms the original agreement reached in the agreement of sale.

There are two parties to a deed: the grantor and the grantee. (See also deed of trust, general warranty deed, quitclaim deed, and special warranty deed.)
Deed of Trust Like a mortgage, a security instrument whereby real property is given as security for a debt. However, in a deed of trust there are three parties to the instrument: the borrower, the trustee, and the lender, (or beneficiary). In such a transaction, the borrower transfers the legal title for the property to the trustee who holds the property in trust as security for the payment of the debt to the lender or beneficiary. If the borrower pays the debt as agreed, the deed of trust becomes void. If, however, he defaults in the payment of the debt, the trustee may sell the property at a public sale, under the terms of the deed of trust. In most jurisdictions where the deed of trust is in force, the borrower is subject to having his property sold without benefit of legal proceedings. A few States have begun in recent years to treat the deed of trust like a mortgage. (See also Deed).

In the event of default, the mortgage may give the lender the right to accelerate payments, take possession and receive rents, and start foreclosure. Defaults may also come about by the failure to observe other conditions in the mortgage or deed of trust.

The agreement of sale will refer to the down payment amount and will acknowledge receipt of the down payment. Down payment is the difference between the sales price and maximum mortgage amount. The down payment may not be refundable if the purchaser fails to buy the property without good cause. If the purchaser wants the down payment to be refundable, he should insert a clause in the agreement of sale specifying the conditions under which the deposit will be refunded, if the agreement does not already contain such clause. If the seller cannot deliver good title, the agreement of sale usually requires the seller to return the down payment and to pay interest and expenses incurred by the purchaser.
Due-on-Sale A clause in a mortgage or deed of trust allowing a lender to require immediate payment of the balance of the loan if the property is sold.
Earnest Money The deposit money given to the seller or his agent by the potential buyer upon the signing of the agreement of sale to show that he is serious about buying the house.

It can take numerous forms, such as zoning ordinances, easement rights, claims, mortgages, liens, charges, a pending legal action, unpaid taxes, or restrictive covenants. An encumbrance does not legally prevent transfer of the property to another. A title search is all that is usually done to reveal the existence of such encumbrances, and it is up to the buyer to determine whether he wants to purchase with the encumbrance, or what can be done to remove it.

When the mortgage and all other debts against the property are paid in full the homeowner has 100% equity in his property.
Escrow Funds Funds paid by one party to another (the escrow agent) to hold until the occurrence of a specified event, after which the funds are released to a designated individual. In FHA mortgage transactions an escrow account usually refers to the funds a mortgagor pays the lender at the time of the periodic mortgage payments. The money is held in a trust fund, provided by the lender for the buyer. Such funds should be adequate to cover yearly-anticipated expenditures for mortgage insurance premiums, taxes, hazard insurance premiums, and special assessments.

Over the past five years, Live Path has leveraged its connections to create over 30 remarkable sessions and events at the annual SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, and we’re currently planning another terrific new series for 2015.
While some might view this as a disconnect from the work we normally do, in actuality, these efforts are a strategic, natural extension of the work we do; helping our clients reach new audiences, tell more compelling stories, build brand awareness, affinity and better serve others. The remarkable experiences we create at SXSW tell compelling stories that inspire, challenge and engage participants, celebrate technology innovation (and innovators) and build strategic relationships for the clients we serve.
Our efforts at SXSW are not just about client work, however. As a long-time member of the SXSW community, we have a personal mission to serve the SXSW community. Through our efforts, we’ve connected SXSW participants with amazing causes, including FIRST®, OpenStand and IEEE Women in Engineering. In 2011, in the wake of the Japan Earthquake and Tsunami disaster, we also created our own SXSWCares / SXSW4Japan ten-day effort, which was featured in a recent documentary produced by the Public Interest Registry (.org) called “Social Good in a Digital Age: Digital Citizen.” The documentary features SXSW4Japan alongside Wikipedia and the #Occupy movement and can be accessed at 12:59, and includes an in-depth interview with Live Path Founder, Leigh Durst and her partner Rob Wu, CEO of CauseVox.
On the client side, for four years, we have worked with IEEE, the largest global professional organization advancing technology for humanity, to curate and organize a number of IEEE speakers series at SXSW. By design, these sessions frame the IEEE brand against a backdrop of “remarkable dialog” featuring renown leaders, and tell compelling stories of technology innovation across a variety of sectors that inspire and engage.
We started with three events in 2012. Our 2014 series featured 18 sessions and events. We’ve proposed eight for 2015… and look forward to telling you more about this series.
In the mean time, while it would be impossible to highlight every session, here are a few video highlights of some of our keynote and featured speakers as well as several other sessions/events.
Missio Dei is a Contemporary Baptist Church located in Galena IL that is committed to being a blessing to our community. Through our upcomming events and service projects we seek to express God’s love for our community in tangible ways.

For as the earth brings forth its bud, as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth, so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.
The attributes of God are so exalted that, just by remembering them, praise will come from our lips. God is good, holy, worthy, merciful, almighty, righteous, sovereign, among many other qualities that make him worthy of all praise. But Isaiah 61:11 goes beyond all that. Praise sprouts from God himself, who places in us both the will and the work of giving praise, glory and honor to Him who lives forever.
There are other attributes and qualities of God that bring praise to the lips of those who take them into account. God is glorious, wise, great, majestic, strong, omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, self-existent, protector, victor, clement, high, creator, eternal, provider and healer, among many exceptional characteristics. There are plenty of reasons to praise God.
Isaiah 61:11 points out another of God’s qualities that He brings forth together with praise, His righteousness. God is righteous and this is a great reason to praise Him. Psalms 45:6 says, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom. The psalmist is praising the throne of God, which he calls the scepter of righteousness. While Psalms 71:19 says, Also Your righteousness, O God, is very high, You who have done great things; O God, who is like You?
God’s righteousness sprouts praise. In fact, Psalms 98 and 146 are entitled “Praise for the righteousness of God.” Not in vain did our Lord Jesus Christ say in Matthew 6:33, But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Let’s seek the righteousness of God before any of the other things, praise the righteous and sprout praise along with His righteousness before the nations in the same way that the seed of the earth springs forth.
From Psalm 98 we learn how praise for God’s righteousness manifests itself. Psalms 98:4 says, Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth; break forth in song, rejoice, and sing praises. In that way we approach our righteous God, of whom Psalm 98:9 says the following: For He is coming to judge the earth. With righteousness He shall judge the world, and the peoples with equity.
Let our praise be as David expressed it in Psalms 35:28, And my tongue shall speak of Your righteousness and of Your praise all the day long. Without a doubt that God’s righteousness and His praise go hand in hand. Thanks to His righteousness, we who have responded to His plan of salvation have been justified. That makes our lips full of praise for His love, for His forgiveness, for His grace and His salvation.
The final part of Paul’s prayer for believers is in Philippians 1:9-11 and it goes like this, And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment, that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ, being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. Let’s fill ourselves with the fruits of justice for His praise. God bless you.

Wishing you and your family a Happy Thanksgiving! We give thanks with a grateful heart for all our wonderful customers!! We love sharing our calming, soothing, healing Organic Lavender with you 🙂 When Life Gets To YOU~Get To The Lavender!!
Here comes November, my favorite season, when everything changes around us, preparing for cooler days of Winter. When I’m out for a walk, I love to kick up the fallen leaves in brilliant orange, yellow, and reds! 🙂 As I inhale the cool breeze, I catch whiffs of lavender that still linger around our lavender farm. Pure Fall Bliss 🙂 My favorite aromatherapy…Nature!!
Sigh… Our Upick Lavender Farm is closed for the season, but our Website is Always OPEN for business 🙂 … I welcome more calm days ahead. Time to rejuvenate my soul, and enjoy a hot cup of soothing Lavender “Gorge Wind” Tea 🙂
Cheers to a wonderful year filled with amazing joyful memories in the warm sunshine, among 1000’s of calming, intoxicating brilliant Lavender flowers, happy Bees, and calm, happy people!!!! 🙂 Life is Good!
Yes…this is the Calm Zone and people have memories of this, to carry them through the long cold winter months ahead….. 🙂
When I observe our customers Chillaxin on the grass, it brings joy to my heart, because I know we’ve succeed in creating a calm space that is welcoming to this posture! Pure Bliss and Calm, relaxing in Nature….Earthing!
This fall we’ve had the most wonderful warm, sunny weather. So nice that our Angustifolia Lavender (English or True Lavender) had an incredible 2nd bloom. That only happens when we receive lots of warm sunny days in September and October, an Indian Summer, as they call it. 🙂 Many folks experienced U-picking their own lovely fragrant English lavender bouquet in the entire month October to take home and enjoy it’s beautiful calm aroma!!!
And what could be more enjoyable than a picnic on the farm, relaxing in the calm lavender breeze with your family & friends on a gorgeous fall day! Perfect 🙂

And don’t forget to play with your dog ( if you have one..or two) ! This is my sweet puppy, Ella, at 8 mths old and dear sweet Sadie, at 15 yrs….. Our Joy!!!! 🙂
Fancy winning a hard back copy of the fantastic new official Elite: Dangerous novel Elite: Legacy signed by the author?
For your chance to win you need to write a Drabble (a 100 word story – not including the title) featuring in some way Lave Station.
Michael Brookes has kindly accepted the role of judge (subject to there not being millions of entries, the man has a game to develop!)
Drabbles will be read out by our own Grant “Psykokow! on the “Abrakadrabble Show” after the competition closes.
Competition will close on Sunday the 15th of February with the winner being announced shortly after.
Cmdr Winnard parked up outside lave station to listen to the latest lave radio, he was all excited he hadn’t slept in months, soon the dulcet tones of the radio presenters came over the airwaves, apparently one of them had graduated to big boy pants this month and Cmdr Winnard wanted to know which one of the presenters had managed it. He struggled through the introductions trying hard to keep his eyes open and his ears listening, it was no use the repetivity of the subjects had lulled him off to sleep again, He never would find out who graduated….
It had been thirty years. Thirty years since he first picked up his Pilot’s license and left to seek his fortune.
So many stories bridged that time and now, adventures without number out in the vast, empty spaces beyond. The tedium of the long hauls, the terror and excitement of combat, the fear as atmosphere vented to vacuum, the jubilation of triumph.
The Cobra’s controls were worn with time and use, but they still responded as well as they ever had. He opened a channel, made his final course corrections.
The last sidewinder met it’s fiery doom. “Sir, we just lost Alpha One. Cutter is now turning towards us”. Fear was clearly audible in the Lieutenants voice. “Orders Captain?” “Retract weapons and reroute energy to the frameshiftdrive. Incoming fire made the shields glow. “Skipper we can’t jump with imps on our tail.” “Helm, set an intercept course, his shields are down. Ram the bastard, that way we can buy the time we need for the jump to Lave station.” Claxons wailing and bulkheads bursting but the clipper was finally adrift venting atmosphere in their wake. A lone voice counted 4,3,2,1
They try, and fail, to explain how big space is. But what nobody talks about is the time that gets lost.
With no night and no day, no melt and no frost; unnoticed, the years slip away and sense of distance dissolved.
Owena travelled far for her bounties. Sins of frontier pirates now absolved, she braved thousands of light-years, and kissed a hundred stars.
She had returned to her true home; her people, her nation. The landing gear lowered, finally docking at Lave Station.
‘Great’, she thought as he heard the laugh of the pirate over his Comms. Muting the coms and she eyed the cool down time of his FSD. 10 seconds.
The hauler shook violently as it was riddled by the by the pirate’s guns. The pilot hit the afterburner and threw the ship into a violent roll while she quickly disabled the flight assist. She heard the ship groan as it spun and flew forward at top speed. With all power diverted to the systems she watched a halo of rounds whizz by his canopy.
She hit the jump button and held her breath as she was the drive bar fill in the hub. The hauler took a second hit, and saw that the hull was down to 45%. She started to wonder if removing the shield battery to add a 3rd cargo rack was the best idea.
Then she saw the beautiful blue of the cruise speed, and quickly selected the closest station. She jammed on the throttle and swung the hauler into a intercept.
To be eligible your drabble needs to be 100 words in length, at my calculation you currently have 185.
“…day, mayday, this is the …ship Daedalus, we are und …tack from vessels of unknown …in Lave Station, this is th… …dalus, …appear …alien in origin …mayd …”
Space outside the station boiled and seethed. Strange, alien shapes began to emerge from the depths.
Drifting slowly Carl matched his ships rotation to that of Lave station, he had done this thousands of times before. His mind drifted off with thoughts of the shiny new cobra that was waiting for him after this run of rares, it had been a hard grind to get to the half million credits but it would all be worth it for a grade A cobra. No multiple jumps, wasted time Suddenly alarms sound and a “Trespass Warning” flashes on the screen the 15 second timer starts counting down, pulling back and firing boosters, 2, 1 lasers flash, ship disintegrates.
Commander Stroud sat at his desk looking exacerbated, cigarette in hand “What do you mean they want it back?”
He pressed his argument “But this is the heaviest trafficked system in the damn Alliance! We got the Orbis station following the Revolution as part Lave’s entry package!”
Stroud sighed and rubbed his temples. Stubbing out the cigarette, he opened the intercom to his secretary “Carole, Get the Tionisla graveyard on the line. See if we can get the old Coriolis back.”
The blue halo fades as the viper emerges from supercuise. Ahead lies the light studded geometric shape of Lave Station. Outside a dozen ships are coming and going. Normal business for a busy station, but the pilot is looking for something else. It takes a few moments to find the innocuous sidewinder hanging motionless near the bulk of the station. The pilot can’t tell from this range but he know instinctively that it’ll be orange.
The pilot checks the time. Five minutes until the show starts. He guns the viper’s engines and deploys the hardpoints. There’s no time to waste.
Stuck in sub-light speed! He had almost reached Lave when his FSD failed. Now he was getting a stern reminder about how big was outer space. Sometimes “do-able” is worse than “hopeless”. He had the resources to make the eight week crawl, but the computer glitch that had taken out his drive had also wiped all his media files. It was going to be a long boring trip.
His comms could still take incoming calls. He flicked a switch and heard “You’re listening to L-L-Lave Radio: the hottest station this side of Diso…” He winced and flicked the switch off.
Captain Seamus Young signed the paperwork from Faulcon deLacy, accepting the final shipment of Viper Mk IIIs into the Lave Station Authority. Beautiful, heavily armored, and more deadly with two extra hardpoints, the newest model was a marked improvement over the Mk IIs.
“On this 5th day of the seventh month of 3288, we bid a fond farewell to the last of our old fleet,” he said as the station opened fire and tore the four to pieces.
Your entry is actually 101 words long. Or if “End of an Era” is your title, then it’s only 97. Unfortunately it has to be 100 on the dot, excluding a title if you choose to give it one.
You have until later this evening to submit an edit, otherwise I’m afraid I cannot submit your entry for judging.
It’s the periods in the Mk.IIIs and MK.IIs causing the issue. http://www.wordcounter.net/ picks them up as two words (the Mk and the II bit’s separately) while Word sees them as single words.
Alright, I’ll allow it. However, I’ve removed the unconventional punctuation from the submission. It’s still something people need to be mindful of IMO.
The sound of the strings raced as he pulled back on his stick. The magnificent vista of the rotating Lave Station inched down into view as the familiar strains of “The Blue Danube” played.
With flight assist off, he tapped his stick right to match angular velocity. The strident waltz was the perfect accompaniment for the spectacle of approaching such a grandiose floating cathedral.
The dancing strings were abruptly replaced by a warning klaxon as he dunted the nose of his Eagle into the station wall.
Commander Madeleine Powers approached Lave station, aiming to drop out of supercruise as close as possible. Her hold was filled with rare alien eggs found on the edges of space, a promise of life in luxury.
On her vision’s edge a dark insectoid shape emerged from sparkling clouds, big enough to block out half of the sun.
A green beam shot from the front of the structure directly at Lave. Just through the blast doors she saw the back half of the station already starting to drift off into space.
The Orca gently lifted from the launch pad and began it’s slow, graceful glid towards the starport exit.
The Captian rose from her seat. “You have the helm, number one. I’m going to address our passengers.”
Nodding to the technician she cleared her throat, announcing her presence. Her voice was amplified throughout the lounge.
See, proof this station was the first. She’s the oldest, the prototype – and still turning thanks to us maintenance crews.
The controller groaned when he heard the explosion. Faulcon_de_Lacy had a deal with Lave Academy to provide as many free Sidewinders to students as they needed. This new lot of recruits took full advantage.
He watched another Sidewinder dodge the hull remnants and silently pass through the docking slot. He fingered his trigger muttering to himself “were you too distracted by that firework display to remember docking procedure?”.
A storm of laser fire dissolved the Sidewinder into a bright cloud of billowing plasma and plasteel fragments. There was a gleam in the controller’s eye, “You didn’t say the magic word!”
It’s a hot day in Lave station, business had been brisk and the air scrubbers were still only on half power. The heat exchangers just couldn’t keep up with the thermal energy this number of ships produced, as for the fly boys who think it is fun to boost out of the station it all just add to the heat. He watches as a sidewinder emerges from the hanger, leaves the pad, arc’s and crashes into the opposite wall of the station. “Why have rotational correction buttons anyway” he thought as he went back to his cold beer.
Mark lay there watching the stars that were Lave stations landing pad lights on the opposite side of the station twinkle, mind drifts off to younger happier days. School was fun, carefree although now he wished he had listened more. What was that calculation, terminal velocity, mass acceleration due to gravity. Now he knew the station had reduced gravity, was the air density the same as a planet? What speed had he got to? but the final question that passed through his mind was why are there no barriers around the landing pads. Mark blacked out for the last time.
30 years ago I sat on pad 32 in Lave Station, awaiting clearance to launch for the first time as a qualified pilot.
I’d finished top of my class, my scores were off the chart, hell, there was even talk of a plaque to mark my “Outstanding Achievement. “
Quite why I thought hitting boost and corkscrewing out the letterbox was a good idea escapes me now.
The story is Lave Station got upgraded to an Orbis Station following the Revolution, some sort or reward or something.
See, we were shipping Irukaman Giant Snails, 456 tonnes of the buggers, and there was an issue with the pods and they kinda turned to mush. Nasty, stinking, vomit inducing mush.
We were supposed to flush them into the Station’s Effluent System, but Dave, well, Dave might have been a bit drunk.
One month ago, smuggling the illegal cargo was the toughest, most intense thing she’d done. But it was lacking something, so she’d stowed it away in a locked space in her cabin on Lave Station, one of the oldest Corolis stations in use. She scoured dozens of systems before finally finding the right part.
If you have ever visited Lave Station, you have probably also encountered members of one of the Old Worlds’ most curious cults – likely without noticing. While other stations are maintained by hired contractors or military engineers, the “Lavean Brotherhood of Engineers” is a religious order built around the belief that Lave Station will play a pivotal role in saving humankind during a future cataclysmic event. The brotherhood cares little for politics; keeping the station – which members of the order are symbolically married to at initiation – running is its holy duty. Leaders of the cult claim to be able to tune in to the station’s “spirit”.
“Sounds like stupid place. Everyone obsessed by soap. You Imps wash too much. How you spell ‘Layv’?”
“Poop-poop people on Lav-ee station. Yes. So now I know your secret. You haul poop-poop across Galaxy.”
Chris, Lave station’s head of entertainment, despite a valiant effort, failed to hide his shock at the whispered request the customer before him had made; a man mostly hidden behind a heavy jacket with the collar pulled up, a wide brimmed hat pulled low and oversized sunglasses.
Finally, reluctantly, his composure barely regained, Chris leaned forward and whispered, ‘Grant, there’s no such thing as hardcore zero gee Thargoid porn.’
Jack moved through the bowels of Lave Station One. Some idiot had crashed into its’ back on a training run and gotten stuck, not bounced or exploded as usual.
In his pressure suit he inspected the collapsed part of the structure from the inside. A straight metal beam looked strangely out of place in the twisted wreckage. A plaque came into view: “Smithonian Institute Loan, year 2752. A western frontier’s railway track dated 1823 to commemorate new human expansion.”.
“Final frontier, alright” he thought, following the line of the historic track through the sidewinder’s canopy, cockpit seat and cabin wall.
Oh Lave station, you are many things to many people. A jewel crossing the night sky. A gateway to the stars. A destination and welcome sight to a weary traveller. A symbol of strength and security in a galaxy brimming with danger. You are a place of work for some and a place of commerce for others. And for a few, those lucky, lucky few, you are that most important thing; a home. For me, for tonight, you are a prison. But my love for you remains true.
Don’t seem to be able to edit, probably due to some idiocy on my part, but tweaked this entry a wee bit, though I doubt it’ll make much difference given the quality of the competition 🙂

You’ve got until later this evening to make changes, otherwise I’m afraid it can’t be included for judging.
Dar’koba disembarked, locked his ship, passed through the formalities and entered the station proper.
The sights around him were somehow familiar but, at the same time, strange. He intuitively knew the layout of corridors, passageways and open spaces, but the colours were unexpected, a constant surprise, signs of age here and there and the occasional artwork, hitherto seen only in videozines.
Despite this being his first and only real visit to Lave, there was a persuasive, all-pervading sense of coming home.
Over the years he’d managed to trace what had happened to his parents and their ship. He’d found the corrupt industrialist who had paid to have them “removed” and their ship “commandeered” in order to use its advanced technologies for his own profit.
The industrialist’s last words were to name the mercenaries he’d hired to do the job. Dar’koba didn’t hurt him again – just let him die in his own filth.
Dar’koba studied incoming traffic patiently, waiting to fulfil his mission. He knew they’d eventually turn up. Everybody did.
A vessel entered Lave station and settled in bay 23. The radically modified ship was unmistakably recognisable to Dar’koba. They’d arrived!
After extracting all valuable parts, their ‘patron’ had given the remains of the ship as part payment to the mercenaries.
Dar’koba used the next two cycles to cautiously approach them, commenting on their remarkable ship, asking them what they did for a living.
Finally, he asked them if they were interested in some work. They couldn’t refuse the sum offered, half in advance. They took the bait.
(16/02/15 Edit by Lisa T: Edited at the request of the user, to make drabble valid for the competition.)
Sorry, Lisa. It might be this old rubber band powered lap-top, or the old XP system, but (edit) is not showing anywhere. Nor does anywhere light up with the cursor, except for the ‘reply’ line.
In the cockpit, its two crew fared little better. Unwashed, unshaven, gaunt and pale, despite the proximity of the red star.
Professor Corinthian Plynth, a renowned philanthropist and charitable benefactor living on Stillman Station in the Baxbakeris System, had made millions carefully brokering precious metals deals, gaining a widespread reputation as an astute and trustworthy business man. His word was better regarded by those he dealt with, than an Imperial decree.
Crippled in youth, his generosity led from his own inability to repay a debt of kindness to a neighbour who, returning from the liberation of far flung Lave, salvaged a set of motorised leg braces which had so profoundly improved Sebastian’s life.
“Don’t look up” I whisper, head reeling from the oppressive expanse of Lave dock radiating down on me. Fern seeing me off was great but “have another brandy” wasn’t.
Clutching my boarding card tighter I gulp as the tarmac drifts momentarily under my unsteady feet. Today this coriolis and I part ways, tomorrow who knows where I’ll be.
I follow the official’s gaze, up, up and into the distance as he laughs “Son, that’s your ship… you might want to run.”
Gruffly, almost growling, the portly station chef replied in his lilting brogue “Watch yer tone laddie. Ave been waiting in line, am next”.
“Chef… Tatt-Ee? This queue’s for the Alliance security force and fighter recruitment. I hardly think a cook will be any use in station patrols never mind pirate skirmishes.”
“Ha! With a ‘Harmless’ rating? And just what exactly can you bring to the force that’s even the slightest bit dangerous?”
But this daily commute, I don’t know if I can put up with it much longer. Sharing this enclosed space every morning, I mean urgh! And the nausea.
I can only avoiding thinking about that as our weight diminishes by watching this space fill up with Lave residents who just get poorer and smellier the closer we get to the station’s core.
Maybe soon I’ll get promoted, work “up top” on the station’s prestigious office level and never take the elevator ever again!
Many speak of the fabled Lave Station with such magnificent prose that the blessed angels, weep at their own drabness by comparison.
However, for posterity be it known that when space-bound for the first time, I first beheld it’s bejewelled majesty spinning in the heavens against the twinkling midnight gossamer of space, my heart so filled with joy and pride that I could but silently weep at the spectacle.
Surfing the envelope six, rebels minding, my rear view. Short tanking in range, jump charging too. Escape vectoring, a gear shift to a quarter barrel roll banked right.
No moon set. No star rise but views darkening. Clusters all behind, sleeves the curving arms ahead now. Third eye peering, not for deep space wanteds or miners sorrow.
Bursting forwards, Winder piles into the witch seconds of subspace. It’s counting, and still counting. More. “Power Up” shields, “Readying” fire groups. Been caught thus before.
The jump hurls, hurtling by a pairing star. Glarish and fading, the curtain, to five Thargoid Armadas.
No Idea how to edit a message here can a mod please add “The End” to my drabble “But its a dry heat”
There seem to be quite a few people having problems with editing. Glad it’s not only me. Any idea what the cause is?
It’s a hot day in Lave station, business had been brisk and the air scrubbers were still only running on half power. The heat exchangers just couldn’t keep up with the thermal energy this number of ships produced, as for the fly boys who think it is fun to boost out of the station it all just add to the heat. He watches as a sidewinder emerges from the hanger, leaves the pad, arc’s and crashes into the opposite wall of the station. “Why have rotational correction disable toggles anyway” he thought as he went back to his cold beer.
Didn’t realise it was a strict 100 words no more and no less. Please find a modified 100 word exact version above
So what became of “Drabbles will be read out by our own Grant “Psykokow! on the “Abrakadrabble Show” after the competition closes.” –> is that in episode 51?
Now that the winner has been announced the other entries will get read out as part of the Abraka Drabble Show, however this is separate from the normal Lave Radio show rotation and handled by Grant.

The process of filing for Social Security Disability can be complicated. contact us to find out if we can help.
People who are no longer able to work because of physical or mental impairments may be able to claim disability benefits from the Social Security Administration. The Social Security Disability Insurance program, in particular, is meant to help people “insured” by the SSA. In this context, the meaning of “insured” is that you worked long enough and paid your Social Security taxes during your term of employment.
To protect the legitimacy of the Social Security Disability Insurance program, the SSA requires applicants to work through what can be a pretty complicated application process. Unfortunately, the SSA denies many applications the first time around. While you will still be able to appeal the SSA’s decision to deny a claim, it will be in your best interests to work with an attorney to get your initial application right.
At LS Disability, our attorneys can help you determine your eligibility and then work with you to collect the documentation you need to file as complete a claim as possible. We know just how much this claim may mean to you and your family right now, and we have the experience and the resources to help you work though every aspect of the application process for these disability benefits.
In the unfortunate event your spouse passes on, you may be eligible to retain a portion of their Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. To be eligible for surviving spouse benefits under the SSDI program, you must be at least 50 years old and have a qualifying disability prior to the death of your loved one. Of course, these are general rules for which there are exceptions. For instance, you may be eligible for survivor benefits if you are under 50 and care for a child who is under the age of 16 and who also received survivor benefits from your spouse.
If you were diagnosed with a qualifying disability prior to your loved one’s death—meaning you are not able to work because of a physical or mental impairment—your survivor benefits will be dependent upon your age. That means your survivor benefits may be less if you are at least 50 years old than if you are at least 60 years old, but not quite of retirement age. If you are of retirement age, you may be eligible to recover all of your spouse’s SSDI benefits, though there is a chance that it is not in your best interest to do so. To learn more about what is in your best interest, you should consider working with an attorney to file for these benefits.
Adults disabled since childhood may not have had the opportunities to build the kind of work history necessary to qualify for benefits under the Social Security Disability Insurance program. Individuals diagnosed with a physical or mental impairment that would otherwise qualify them for disability benefits may be eligible for SSDI benefits based on the earning record of their parents. The fact that an adult child has never worked will not affect the Social Security Administration’s decision to award benefits.
As a general set of stipulations for these benefits, adult children must be at least 18 years old, unmarried, and have a qualifying impairment that began before they were 22. Though there are some exceptions to these general guidelines, these stipulations must generally be satisfied in order for an applicant to claim SSDI benefits using their parent’s earning record. Moreover, adult children may not have what the SSA determines to be substantial earnings and receive benefits at the same time.
If you or a loved one was diagnosed with a physical or mental impairment you believe makes you eligible to claim disability benefits from Social Security, you should reach out to an attorney who can evaluate your claim and help you file it with the SSA when it is complete. To speak with an attorney at LS Disability about the impairment, please call our offices at today. Our firm is proud to serve the people of California, and we will be happy to help you work through the process of claiming your disability benefits.

'In 1995, the Mexican peso crashed and the economy contracted by 6 percent. At the time, Santiago Levy, the deputy finance minister, realized that the country’s antipoverty programs were going to fail its poor. The programs were a hodgepodge of food subsidies, adopted in response to powerful food producers. They were inefficient because they targeted foods everyone ate, rich and poor. Some even targeted foods the poor don’t eat, such as bread – poor Mexicans eat tortillas.
Mr. Levy saw a looming disaster – but also an opportunity to build political support for an antipoverty program that worked. Stealthily, he organized a pilot project to test a new idea in Campeche, far away from the capital so it would draw little notice. He began a program to pay poor mothers to keep their children in school and take their kids to the health clinic. He compared the results to poverty figures in a group of similar villages without the program. It was a great success. Data in hand, he persuaded President Ernesto Zedillo to phase in the new program and phase out the food subsidies.
Oportunidades, formerly called Progresa, is now embraced by all parties in Mexico and, with financing from the World Bank, is helping virtually every poor family. It not only focuses antipoverty spending on those who really need it, it does so in a way that encourages families to break the cycle of poverty for their children.' (from this blog).
'why do they pay so little attention to the non-voting children in mahbubnagar as compared with the voters in mumbai? a simple dole of ,say, rupees five hundred a month (which is what, almost, the current bill assures) to rural parents who send their children to school would not only cost much less than what the current project would but also a. stop the migration and b. protect the rights of the children.would you call that charity? most of the subsidies and other giveaways intended for the poor are today cornered by the more privileged classes. why shouldn't the poor have their share? but that would not be elaborate enough for the wise men.'
that was actually a part of a long comment i had originally made here on a dilip d'souza article on the employment guarantee act (which i had reposted on this blog as an independent post). this idea had taken a hazy kind of shape in my mind around two years ago when i had started looking at poverty alleviation programmes in india a little closely. i had nursed serious doubts about their efficacy for more than a decade but..ordinary, well-meaning citizens in india don't usually question these programmes hard enough...and they usually let their hearts rule over their heads in these matters. but the nrega was a kind of last straw for me..because i knew, whatever the intentions behind it, it was going to miserably fail. but that wasn't why i primarily objected to it, there were other reasons...and chief among them was that it was a shortsighted program - it didn't address the problem of future poverty, because it ignores the causes of present poverty. worse - it takes money away from programs which would actually help the most in fighting future poverty - schools. funds for the nrega would mean that the much needed increase in the woefully inadequate funding schooling, and education in general in india receives..can be ruled out for a long time.the upa govt had promised to increase budgets for education upto 6% of gdp, as first prescribed by the kothari commission way back in the sixties. now, how can that happen? the twin objectives of my idea were to address both the problems of a.illiteracy b. poverty, in that order, because poverty can't be solved without solving the problem of illiteracy, in my view.
the idea, in a nutshell, was that the govt pays rural parents a certain allowance/dole/sum every month to encourage them to send their children to school. the design of the plan was simple: direct transfer of funds every month from delhi to every villager's doorstep. please read the post and the comments to get a better idea. my contention is that the idea has better chances of fighting leakage and corruption that plague most such schemes in india (because it is based on direct transfer of money from delhi to the beneficiaries...and does not, as annie of known turf and otherindia presumes in the comments, involve any other agency in this transaction).
now, i am pleasantly surprised to find that there are other people in the world, much more important people, endorsing a program that so closely resembles an idea that i'd thought up! the mexico program is now being touted as one of the most successful anti-poverty programs, alongside eight other great endeavours such as universal vaccination, de soto's ownership titles for the poor idea and microcredit etc., Read more about those eight programs on the Poverty & Growth Blog of the World Bank Institute here.
Actually, Milton Friedman had the idea of a negative income tax long back (he mentions it in Capitalism and Freedom) and that is the inspiration for the EITC program in the US which has been an (apparently) effective anti-poverty tool. Charles Murray too recently wrote a book called "In our hands" where he proposed that the welfare state be replaced by an annual cash dole to all adults (his aim was much more radical and ambitious than just eliminating poverty).
In another blog, I was about to point out (but did not) that Kuffir came up with a similar idea. It.is interesting that Kuffir's idea came from thinking about real life situations about bureaucracy, waste, corruption etc. I am not sure about Freedman's ideas. He was a brilliant man and had several ideas. I hope that Kuffir will develop his ideas carefully without reacting to left and right. I am a bit surprised by his fascination with Shrivtsva'a article, but Kuffir seems to have thought long and hard about some of these problems.
yes, i'm aware of friedman's idea of negative income tax and the eitc.. and doles have been discussed for so many years across the world..but very little in india itself.. i find friedman's concept un-implementable in india right now because so little of india's economic activity is actually recorded.. and the reach of the taxing agencies is so pathetically limited. and their resources aren't able to monitor the activities of even those who pay taxes..
i am pleased with the mexican example, not because it proves my own theory...but because it tells us that it could work in india too!
we face similar problems and our resources are similarly limited..and our implementing agencies resmble each other in their inefficiency.. we're both third world!
also, the mexican program focusses on such important goals as education and health..which almost all poverty-alleviation programs in india ignore..
thank you for the endorsement..but which other blog was discussing a similar idea? and who's shrivastava? do you mean d'souza?
I meant this article of Arun Shrivtsava about which you posted in blogbharti. It is as left wing a conspiracy theory as one can imagine. For all I know, he may be right. But my feeling is it is unproductive to pursue such lines. It is perhaps advisable to see what is possible and go along with other parties as much as possible pretending to take their statements at face value. Usually the other parties in spite of their plans do not have their way. Secondly, I think that there are no universal solutions, one has to figure out what suits a given region at a given time and what is possible.
There were a couple of posts in nanopolitan, one about the govt.giving cows to farmers and another about friedman's negative tax propsition. I think that you responded in one of them.
All this is vague. Since I do not have any deep local knowledge, I try to just observe what others say after preliminary discussions.
Blogbharti seems interesting but it is a high-frequency blog. I will read it more once I finish the quarter..
you read me wrong - my objectives on blogbharti are quite different from what i do here - if i link to a post on blobharti, it doesn't mean that i endorse the blogger's views.. quite often, my own personal views could be quite different from the blogger's i link to. my job on blogbharti is to spot and find any view that seems to be reasonably presented and..needs to be heard, adds to the wider debate. in the particular case of shrivastava, i don't actually like many of his ideas - but my view is that we in india tend to ignore environmental issues..often. i've referred to claude alvares' name in the headline - he was an environmentalist who was very active in the seventies-eighties and often wrote about them (environmental issues0 in the mainstream press like the 'illustrated weekly' etc., i once attended a lecture of his in hyderabad.. he had warned us of the ill-effects of the green revolution back then..it is only being echoed by several people now. maybe we should have paid him a little heed back then.
it's not just the environmentalists- i've been exposed to ideas across the indian political/social spectrum...like the hindutvavadis on one end and the militant leftists on the other and everyone else in the middle...and as you pointed, one can/should only agree with the little that's reasonable,if any, in their arguments.
yes, i agree with you that one's views shaped by one's own local/national roots and the solutions too would then..spring from there. you'd have noticed i made the same point on nanopolitan. i'm kind of a loner in the blogworld..in that way. because i don't agree with rigid stances on either side of the spectrum.
Hmm...very interesting article and idea. However, I'm wondering about your claim that the way your idea will be implemented will not open up new avenues for corruption. Who decides which families receive this dole? Won't corruption seep in through that entity or agency which checks the eligibility of families that can receive such aid?
I haven't read all the articles you have linked to so I might have missed it but but I'm wondering how much expenditure this scheme will entail if it is ever implemented. Has anyone made any rough estimates? Does the Indian govt. have that kind of money minus the usual seepage of corruption and inefficiency?
I'm going on a tangent here but how can one minimize corruption if such a scheme is ever implemented?
thanks for finding the post interesting - my primary aim was to toss up the idea, kind of in the air, and test how it sits with people genuinely concerned with this issue like you..i was expecting much derision and ridicule but..the nature of your comment shows that there is such widespread frustration among people on this issue that they're willing to consider any alternative seriously..
in its crude, unrefined form (meaning it can/should be improved)the idea translates into these elements -
* nobody selects the beneficiaries..the children, which means the parents in practice, select themselves. which means it's universal like the nrega (the strong left element in our politics would accept only those kind of programs)
* corruption can't 'seep in through that entity' because there is no such entity. but corruption can seep in if the programme is not effectively monitored - for instance, the parents or someone in their name, could be 'receiving' the money but the child is not in school. false identities could be created. but some of these steps/factors could reduce it to the minimum-
a) a countrywide census that records, apart from regular data, biometric information on all citizens of the country
b)regular check of student attendance rosters against stored data...some biometric elements can be checked and identified in less than a few minutes by new technology that's available, and not so very expensive - some countries are using them extensively. if you are a techie (as seems to be the norm in the blogworld :))you'd be more aware of how technology can be applied in these things,
c) from the population figures available..i've made an estimate that a large majority of families in rural india have children below the age of 14.. which means a majority of citizens in a village could be beneficiaries..which in turn means everyone/anyone could be monitor the program and ask if any child is not in school- why is he/she not in school? it could build positive social pressure on parents and others.
d)ngos in my view could play a better, more useful role in monitoring this program than they can in actually delivering education themselves.. their resources being limited the role they can play in delivering education would be very, very marginal. bit in a monitoring role, they along with other social/political/religious activists can play a role more in keeping with their resources and their strengths.
e)it could be built into the law that a single child outside school would mean the whole village stops receiving the dole. similar punitive measures would mean that everyone..not just the education and social welfare, labour etc., departments would be monitoring the education of every child.
f) a massive propaganda campaign needs to be conducted to make every villager aware of the program - just as (universally as) they are aware of the 'right to vote'. in this campaign too - ngos could play a significant role.
g)there are 'n' number of ways in which money sent from delhi could be siphoned away midway.. here too technology should offer workable solutions.. the money could be transferred directly, electronically, to nearest bank in the village. or to the nearest post office, telegraphically..maybe every family (or woman of the family)can receive a kind of smart card that contains biometric information too.. the experience of the nrega has revealed that even post offices (post masters, actually)have become a part of the problem.. but this can be overcome through the consistent dissemination of information through the campaign i mentioned earlier..
* despite all the measures i suggested there could/would still be a certain amount of leakage/corruption in the program..but this could restricted to 15-20% ..but it will never reach the levels of other 'schemes' where 70-80% is the norm.
* now, the money..the mere figure would probably mean nothing to lay citizens..unless a comparable alternative (to measure against) is offered. let's take the nrega - figures/estimates about this program vary from 50000 crores to 100,000 crores and much above (when it is expanded to all the districts in the country..and then reaches all potential 'workers'). around 40% or more of the nrega scheme would actually go towards adminstrative and material costs. so the poor, if the scheme is implemented with 0% corruption, would get around 25000-50000 crores as their total wages.
to continue my elaboration - the costs.. what's important here is to note the difference between other 'schemes' and the program i suggest is in terms of a)leakage b)duration of returns c)measurable outcomes..roughly.
the link i left in the preceding comment tells you about the 'progress' of the nrega this year..here are a few more links - progress of nrega in bengal and progress in karnataka ..
the performance of the nrega, in terms of people reached, and the leakage as you can see is abysmal..the returns are very short-term and no one has any clue as to how the outcomes can be measured. in the program i suggest, on the other hand, leakage/corruption can be checked to a great degree as i outlined in my earlier comment, the returns would not just be short-term..but also consistent. and they'd translate into a secure future for the beneficiaries and their children! they're definitely measurable..through a simple head-count of high school graduates.
now the budget - we have various estimates which suggest that 25-35% of indian population is below 15. i'll take the higher figure of 35%. around 65% of the population in india lives in villages - let's say around 65-70 crores. approximately 35% of these rural population are children below 15 years..that'd come to a figure like 20-24 crores or so. now, considering the fact that most families in rural india have more than one child...let's say the number of families with at least one child below fifteen would be around 10-12 crores.. (this is guesswork..but you'd agree it's not way off the mark).. so, as the intention of the program is not to encourage people to 'produce' more children - the program would be restricted to one allowance per family (no matter what the size of the family).. so we have an estimate of around 10-12 crore beneficiaries. some estimates say that there are only sixteen crore children of schoolgoing age in rural india.. but roughly, these are rupee costs..
* an allowance of rs.500 per month, per family (mother of the child should be designated the guardian of the child) would work out to rs.6000 per year, per family.
* the total costs of the program would work out to anything between 40,000 crores to 72,000 crores per year(depending on the actual no.of families)
* now the nrega, as i pointed out earlier, would eventually cost much more than that..and half of that would be administrative costs etc (leakage not included)..and if it is eventually expanded to include every working age citizen in rural india, the figure could go up by much more than two times.
* this program, on the other hand, can be phased out..as and when one whole generation of children is educated..because educated parents don't need to be 'bribed' to send their children to school..(that'd mean in ten-fifteen years time)
* even if the allowance is halved, it'd still mean a sizeable addition to the incomes of families in rural india..especially the landless poor who constitute 43% of the population of the villages..
* i don't need to tell you about other positive effects this could have on the rural A)economy B)society.
* more than the resources..what this program requires is a massive reorientation of govts in the centre and the states.. they'd have to put education/health and other 'capabilities-building'(i am inserting my own understanding of amartya sen's prescription here) policies on the very top of their agenda..the centre and the states together have to spend a massive 100,000 crores more on education (to raise it to levels of 6% of gdp)every year..more schools will have to built, existing schools would have to be strengthened and made education-worthy (my question is why can't we build schools that we all can be proud of..modern, fully equipped, fit for the twenty-first century?)more teachers would have to be employed..
* to make all that work more attention needs to be paid by the govts (centre and states) to education (than to other departments)..which would mean that they've to shed/decentralise many of their functions,
* the resources would be more of a burden on the states, individually, than the centre (even the a major portion of the dole would have to come from the centre like in the nreaga scheme)..because they've to start pouring more resources than they're doing now into education..kerala, consistently, spent around 20-25% of its budget on education for many years after 1971.. states like andhra, u.p., and other bimaru states spend less than ten percent on education(and what's the school education component?)..
* the centre and states would've to restructure their 'welfare' spending...this program can replace a host of resource-guzzling inefficient subsidiea/giveaways etc at the centre and save the states from competitive spending on such silly schemes as 'free television sets' etc., this program could actually reduce spending on 'welfare' through its efficiencies..
Thanks Kuffir for the detailed analysis and info, thats a lot of food for thought. Will get back to you after I go through all the links.
When my parents were in a refugee camps in 60s, every family were given around Rs. 50 by the government (which was a large sum at that time). As a result, many families stopped looking for other avenues of earning and stagnated. This caused more harm than good compared to the cases where families were given livelihood options (land, shops, etc.)
While I don't discount the theory of incentive based approach, more research is needed to prove that it can be more practical. Taking away subsidies because the government is unable to plug the holes is like punishing the victims twice. The poor actually suffer because of diversion of subsidies to other quarters, and effective mechanisms are required to plug the holes.
About NREGA, at worst 2% of our GDP is going towards NREGA. A vast section of our rural poor remain unemployed for certain months, and it is the state's responsibility to provide them opportunities to find work. However, NREGA needs to be more imaginative. Other than infrastructure projects, the funds can be used for livelihood training. A percentage of people can be trained in some easily acquired skills. I see vast potential in NREGA in transforming rural life.
As per money for other purposes, they can come from other areas. There is no contradiction in allocating 6% in education, 10% in health and 2% in nrega.
I think the problem is fundamentally in our mindset. Cash is a very dirty word. I remember till I left my school I was never given cash. Parents say "Ask what you want and we would get it". The unsaid part of the reply would be "provided we think it is worthy". It is the same psyche that runs through out. Right from the most basic institution, family, to the most complex, Govt and international agencies like world bank. Everyone thinks that the poor are unintelligent, unimaginative and irresponsible. Hence, the govt (read babus) have to take the "white man's burden" of "guiding" (read deciding, regulating and monitoring" the amelioration of the poor.
Cash would lead to unproductive expenditure, they and even I thought once. But if you are really serious about the money going into booze, why do you auction liquor licences? On a serious note, irresponsibility towards family is matter personal perversion. It is not and cannot be linked to poverty. The chances of a father being irresponsible in a rich household is in no way lesser than a poor one.
But we cannot come into terms with this fact. The poor have to be ignorant and irresponsible. Hence don't give them cash. Instead give them work (even if it mean filling and digging wells). Give them grains (even if it means that they have to transported over thousands of kilometers benefiting rich farmers and transport companies).
I again repeat what I said in the comment to the previous post of kuffir. The govt spends Rs 3.65 to tranfer Rs 1 of food subsidy. The case would not be very different in other subsidies/programmes.
I agree there is a chance of leakage and corruption in the identification of beneficiaries. But that is common to all schemes. But where doles might score against others is that there is no further leakage in terms of deciding what "asset" should be created, which contractor should create it, how much should it cost, etc.
Ultimately, all the welfare schemes must ensure capacity building, not infrastructure (a very catchy word in the 10%-aspiring-era) building.
i thought i wouldn't need to point out how the dole idea is better than nrega considering i've already done that at length in my earlier responses to anil.. but i'd like to respond one important point that you raised -
'As per money for other purposes, they can come from other areas. There is no contradiction in allocating 6% in education, 10% in health and 2% in nrega.'
let's look at this possible scenario - the nrega, let's assume, reaches all families in the rural india without exception, as it is intended, in the next three years. that means:
1) it has reached around 12-15 crore families (this is a guesstimate based on the assumtion that the villages constitute more than 65% of total indian population). let's settle for the figure of 13 crore families..meaning 13 crore 'workers'.
2)at around 100 rs a day per worker for a hundred days a year..the total wages for each worker for a year works out to 10,000 rs. for 13 crore workers the total wage bill would be around 1,30,000 crores.
3)if you a figure of another 1,30,000 crores to account for the administrative and material costs associated with the nrega..the total budget for the nrega would increase to 2,60,000 crores a year.
4)the estimated total expenditure of the central govt, on all heads, in 2006-7 is around 5,50,000 crores. if we assume the increase in total expenditure in the next three years is around 10% a year ..then the total expenditure, three years from now, would be around 7,80,000 crores. or a total increase of around 2,30,000 crores.
that'd mean the total increase in expenditure would all have to go to support the nrega- and that still wouldn't be enough.
this would mean a) there can be no increase in expenditure in any other area by the central govt and definitely not in education.
for expenditure on education to reach around 6% of gdp, the central govt on its part would have to spend an additional 40,000 crores or so a year..the rest of the increase of around 40,000-60,000 crores would have to come from the states. nothing less
than an increase of 100,000 crores from the current levels would meet the neglected demands of the education sector. now, you tell me whether this increase is possible with the nrega..
as for nrega being better than a dole i'd say..cosmic voices presents a much better case against that idea.
'Everyone thinks that the poor are unintelligent, unimaginative and irresponsible. Hence, the govt (read babus) have to take the "white man's burden" of "guiding" (read deciding, regulating and monitoring" the amelioration of the poor.'
that's a brilliant summing up of the attitude of our rulers. i couldn't have said it better. i should remind myself that i need to visit your blog at least twice every day to sharpen my wits. thanks for the endorsement.

Rod Serling's movie treatment for Planet Of The Apes is the stuff of legend. It is set in a futuristic city like the book. The scenario is very, very similar to the original movie, only with an Ape City which looks an awful lot like Manhattan, robbing the Statue Of Liberty ending of all of it's shock during the twist ending. The rest of the differences are subtle and the story plays out more like a 90 minute episode of The Twilight Zone.
Serling did multiple swings at bat with his treatments, and this is sort of a hybrid of the later ones. The basic framework of the original film is largely unchanged. The Apes live in a society that appears to be the mid-1960s and are intelligent and civilized. Humans are primitive animals kept in cages. Elements of the original production art are utilized here. The original design of Doctor Zaius is used in this book.
None of the wow moments in the original movie are present here. The writers who came in after Serling punched things up considerably. If the movie were made to this script it would have been successful but not as fondly remembered. It's easy to take the movie for granted today, but those special effects were cutting edge stuff for their time.
This is a good read, but that's about it. It's not great. The artwork has a storyboard vibe to it, being left intentionally unpolished. I would have liked to see it spit shined to mid-60s photo realism perfection. I'm glad that this book was released, as Rod Serling's treatment deserves to be experienced after all of these years.

Some fans may be dissapointed that the transfer window has closed without a big name striker being signed.
Me? I am just happy it has closed. That we have retained all of the players we wanted to apart from Mascherano who we all knew was
If somebody had told me at the end of last season we could get rid of Benitez, Insua, El zhar, Degen, Dossena and Aqulani. keep everyone else
including Torres and Gerrard bring in Konchesky, Cole, Miereles, Poulsen and all of the others I would have said that will do nicely thank you.
Add to that H & G have de facto been removed from the club and new ownership is underway and I would have pinched myself to see if I was dreaming or it was really happening?
Add to that Roy Hodgson accepting to become our manager and if I was a dog with two tails, both of them would be wagging at once.
Well it has happened and our club is well on the road to recovery. I know it is not going to change overnight we still need responsible owners with pockets big enough to allow the club to fulfill its potential. And I honestly think that part of the puzzle will shortly be put in place.
Well now Roy has the difficult task of whittling down the players at his disposal to a squad of 25. No easy task as the players you select for this playing sqaud need to be players who will stay fit and are not injury prone. I think that was the reason for Aquilani going he was just too big a risk to put in the final squad.
Finally I am pleased that Ryan Babel stated he was not going to go anywhere and has said to Hodgson "Never mind buying another striker give me a chance to play there" he has undisputed talent and I do not feel he was ever given a fair chance under Benitez. He has performed well so far in the few opportunities he has been given and for me he is at least as good if not better than Jovanovic. So if he has finally sorted out his attitude problems then we don't need to panic buy whoever is left at the end of the transfer window. And I didn't really fancy any of the names we were being linked with so go on Ryan Carpe Diem
Well here is the list of players we have registerd at Liverpool as you can see we cannot name a squad of 25 players as we do not have enough players.
I have heard Roy has only registered a squad of 21 Players. And we are relying on two relaltively inexperienced youngsters in Spearing and Derby to reach the 8 Home grown
Well this rule was brought about to give local young players a better chance of playing, now if you look through our list most of the youngsters aren't even local. Makes you wonder about the wisdom of this rule? [/b]With the close of the transfer window, all Premier League clubs are now required to submit their 25 man squads.
Each squad must include 8 homegrown players, and thus a maximum of 17 foreign players over the age of 21.
Liverpool, though, do not have enough players to actually name 25 players on their list. That's it until January now, the earliest any changes can be made. This new scheme is likely to come in from criticism when injuries start to bite!
Players born after 1/1/89 and thus are unlimited in the squad and not required to be named in the 25 man list.
Now Roy has registered 8 Home Grown players and 13 Foreign players. That leaves him 4 places in his sqaud that he could fill with
foreign players that are free agents. It could well be that now all Prem clubs have registered their squads, that there will be one or two
worthwhile players who not having made their own squads or possibly that their clubs didn't succeed in selling for the price they wanted.
God is jealous and does not share His glory or His praise with sculptures or images. The Bible establishes very clearly the rejection of God towards all cult to images and sculptures. It is not necessary to be a gifted genius to understand this because everything is written in a plain language that does not require the interpretation of a scholar. The Scripture leaves no doubt that God and the images are incompatible. There are those who deceive themselves by saying that they do not worship images but admire them. By Isaiah 42:8, it is established that a simple eulogy to a sculpture is already rejected by God.
The prohibition of all kinds of worship, praise and adoration of images and sculptures is established in the second commandment of the Law of God. Exodus 20:4-6 says, You shall not make for yourself a carved image, any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.
For God all image and sculpture is an abomination. Deuteronomy 7:25-26 says about it, You shall burn the carved images of their gods with fire; you shall not covet the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it for yourselves, lest you be snared by it; for it is an abomination to the Lord your God. Nor shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you be doomed to destruction like it. You shall utterly detest it and utterly abhor it, for it is an accursed thing. That means that even having images and sculptures in our house is a curse.
In Micah 5:13 we are again commanded not to bow down before the images, I will cut off your carved images and your sacred pillars from among you, so that you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands. Sculptures and images are useless, as Habakkuk 2:18 says, What profit is the image, that its maker should carve it, the molded image, a teacher of lies, that the maker of its mold should trust in it, to make mute idols? And if sculptures and images do not work, why worship them?
The images produce anger and jealousy to God. Psalms 78:58 says, For they provoked Him to anger with their high places, and moved Him to jealousy with their carved images. If we really love God, why make him angry by practicing what He hates? But if that does not matter to you, look at what Leviticus 26:30 says about what will happen to the image worshipers, I then will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and heap your remains on the remains of your idols, for My soul shall abhor you.
Serving images is a shame, as Psalms 97:7 says, Let all be put to shame who serve carved images, who boast of idols. Worship Him, all you gods. Only before God should we prostrate ourselves and only to Him we will praise, He who does not share His praise with sculptures. Let us not be confused, according to what Isaiah 42:17 says, They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, who trust in carved images, who say to the molded images, ‘You are our gods.’ Let us not waste time keeping honor to objects that have absolutely nothing of sacred according to the Bible. God bless you.

It was in good enough condition to be used as a play dress because it wasn't actually falling apart. It had nice flat felled seams at the front of the shoulders,
and a bound neckline with a bit of staining - probably pasta sauce, a great favourite with toddlers.
... and finally, the most exciting part of all, the first buttonholes I have made with the buttonholer.
This has been a really enjoyable project from start to finish. I used the 1949 Singer 15K hand machine for all the machine stitching, except for the buttonholes, where I used the Singer 201K treadle.

Did you know that the original name for Pac-Man was Puck-Man?

Social Media engagement and management at events is all the BUZZ these days. Our award winning GoSocial solution powered by BUZZcontrol is specifically designed to connect brands/events with their audiences. GoSocial doesn’t replace or duplicate your existing social teams and initiatives, to the contrary, it energizes efforts by:
INSTANT CONNECTION OF ONSITE AND ONLINE AUDIENCE – reach is now exponentially greater as a massive global audience (typically 100x+) is now engaged and participating with the event!
INCREASED TSV (time spent viewing) as “sticky” real-­‐time moderated/filtered social posts keep people tuned in as they wait to see their posts … hence consuming more promotions and advertisement.
AUTHENTIC REAL-TIME INSIGHT – much more authentic than polling or focus groups, BUZZcontrol gleans unsolicited, unprejudiced, comments and opinions of attendees in REAL-­‐TIME and gives organizers the ability to promote the good and resolve the bad … while it is happening! Want to know the status of traffic, is the concert too loud, too hot, lines too long, web streaming quality, or perhaps which presenters and messaging resonates or what features customers really like about the new product your launching … in moments you’ll have it all and can respond!
COMMUNITY IMPACT – every brand/event is trying to figure out how to effectively and genuinely connect with their audiences (guests, customers, employees, fans..etc.) and be relevant. By enabling GoSocial instantly the event/brand’s digital footprint/reputation/savvy/social IQ is lifted dramatically.
SIGNIFICANT SPONSORSHIP OPPORTUNITY – sponsoring social around an event is single handedly the most prominent, most impactful, most significant, most engaged, highest profile opportunity at an event! Most often GoSocial is paid for by sponsors and an additional revenue stream created for the event! *ROI & VALUE … for the first time sponsors are given hard data and analytics to the impact of their sponsorship as opposed to guestimation or quasi numbers of value.
PROVEN SUCCESS for the last 3 years GoSocial powered by patent pending BUZZcontrol has engaged and managed social for some of the world’s largest brands including: Coke, Apple, Ford, HP, Visa, Bacardi, Victoria’s Secret, Chevrolet, Verizon, John Hancock at global events like the Olympics, Stadium Concerts, Formula 1, Super Bowl, NHL, Final Four, Conventions, Politics, Fashion, PGA, Charities … etc
GoSocial is impacting all sorts of events. The key is to just start. To make it easy we’ve created a GoSocial igniter package. Designed to safely and effectively engage, manage, and reinforce the social conversations happening around your event. It’s a terrific way for you and senior management to get a taste of the impact of this powerful solution without having to involve too many people or commit too much time or resources.
Activation of BUZZcontrol a few days prior to the event, BUZZcontrol throughout the event, and a few days post event. BUZZcontrol will capture all the conversation occurring about the event socially.
BUZZscreen or BUZZstrip will be activated on the GoVision screens onsite. (this is a simple player app which the GV techs switch on to the screen at whatever time the event desires for as long as the event desires).
A BUZZcrew member will manage BUZZcontrol (moderate live) remotely during the times the BUZZscreens are live. This person approves all content that is relevant and event friendly. This member will also schedule any advertising, promotional, and informational content that is requested to play during the event.
A BUZZgallery will be created of all the unique images posted by your guests and given to you post event for use in future events!
BUZZmetrics will be shared in visual reports each day and a complete BUZZmetrics report will be compiled post event proving the impact made at the event.
Of course if you really wanted to be a social super hero our GoSocial BUZZcrew can easily put together a complete onsite award winning plan and strategy, activating several of our patent-­‐pending products and services that will wow your attendees and more important, your senior management!
Located about 20 kms North of Trichy, on the way to Thuraiyur, Thiruvellari temple is housed on a 14 acre property. Inscriptions and the architecture at this temple point to the fact that Pallava, Hoysala and Vijayanagara kings have contributed significantly to this temple. Also has bus facility from Sri Rangam. No boarding and lodging facility.
On first looks, one could easily mistake this Divya Desam for an old fort. The front gopuram (temple tower) reflects a Hoysala style architecture that is so untypical of a Vaishnavite temple. The structure looks half finished and this is attributed to a war which is believed to have stopped half way during the construction.
Vellarai means white rock. Since, this sthalam is situated 100 feet high in the top of the small mountain, which is white in colour, this sthalam is called “Thiru Vellarai”.
Markandeya was destined to die at 16. When Yama came to take him, he clutched on to the Shiva Lingam at ThiruKadaiyur. Pleased with this, Lord Shiva blessed him that he will remain there forever as 16. After enjoying life to the full, Markandeya once again prayed to Lord Shiva asking for Moksham. He is guided by Shiva to go to ThiruVellarai to invoke the blessing of Vishnu.
Once when Sibi Chakravarthi has been tented here with his warriors here, a white boar crossed him. He chased it and the Boar finally went inside a hole. Saint Markandeya was under penance here and King Sibi narrated the incident that occured here and the saint asked the king to perform a Milk Abhiseka to the hole. While doing so Lord Vishnu appeared before them. So Saint Markandeya asked Sibi Chakravarthy to bring 3700 Vaishnavites from North and build a temple here for Lord Vishnu. As requested Sibi Chakravarthy brought the 3700 Vaishnavites from the North and built the temple. While do so one of the Vaishnavite died and King Sibi was very much worried about it. Lord Vishnu again appeared Himself as a Vaishnavite and told King Sibi to count Him and make the numbering as 3700. Saint Naradhar’s disciple Uyyakkondaar wrote “Sri Bhaashyam”, which was left unfinished by him and was finally completed by Vishnu Sithaar. So this rock is called as “Uyyakkondaan Malai”.
There are two entrances to the temple viz. Uttarayana Vasal (Entrance) and Dakshinayana Vasal used during respective periods – Thai to Aani (Jan – July) and Aavani to Margazhi (July to jan). There is one more entrance namely the Naazhi Kettan Vasal signifying the entrance used by the Lord when he came late and was questioned by Thayar. One could have darshan of Sridevi, Bhoodevi, Surya , Chandra, Aadisesha in Prakruta sharira serving the Lord.Avathara Sthala of the Acharyas – Uyyakondar and Engallazhwan.This place helped Sri Ramanuja in propagation of Srivaishnavism .
This temple has a big wall (Mathil sevar) Birth place of Bhakthar Uyyakondaar. Situated on top of a Mountain which is fall of white rocks and 100 feet high. (Vellarai means white rock. Since, this sthalam is situated at the top of a small white mountain, this sthalam is called “Thiru Vellarai”).
Another belief is that no Vaishnavite can get Moksham without visiting Thiruvellarai. Hence, there is this tradition at the temple to call ‘Thiruvellarai Kandeero- Thiruvellarai Kanden Aiyya’ (the devotees informing the Lord that they have seen Thiruvellarai and that they are now ready/eligible for Moksham), a voice that is said to echo to the Lord up there.
Sriman Narayanan is giving dharshan to all living and non living things as Sooriya Narayanan. By extending his rays, he is giving security to the entire world. Sri vishnu who is also named as “Maayavan” at the end of Dhakshinayana kaalam (Margazhi 15th) is named as “Thai Maatha Naayagan”, at the start of Thai Month (Jan 15th).
There is a small explanation that has to be said for the two Vaasals (entrance). In the human life, there are two separate entrances, (i.e.) entering to the life and getting out of it is the other. In both these Vaasals when entering in to the life and when getting out of it, he could be able to feel the presence of Paramaathma. To make this understand, he resembles himself as “Suriya Narayanan” at the state of Utharayanam and as “Govindan” at the end of Dhakshinayanan at the end of Maargazhi.
The Dhakshinayana Vaasal is the Vaasal or entrance which leads us to the death and it is the place of the stay of Lord yeman, the king of Naragam.
The Uthirayana Vaasal, which is the Vaasal which way that all the Jeevathmas enter in to world as an human being (or) a non living being, is the place of “Lord Guberan”, who is the God of wealth.
Even if a person who is well enough in money and his good activity will only lead him towards the Emperumaan. And if a person is very poor and if he is a good hearted and do proper karmas, will lead him to attain the Swargam, the Heaven.
Sri Pundarikakshan, Bhoomi Piratti, Periya piratti, Suriya and Chandiran and Aadisheshan resembles as humans in this sthalam and it can be seen in the Moolavari Place.
Engalaazhvan has written the great “Nadaa thooram Aalukku oppatra pungai Maalai”. Nadaathoramaal means Bhakthan who is having full and entire soul of Bhakthi on the God.
The name which has been given Engalaazhvan as “Nadaathoramaal” has a very special story to be said. Every day he gives milk to Emperumaan. Thinking the milk may be hot, he makes it cold by blowing air through his mouth and gives to Emperumaan. On the action of Engalaazhvan as his mother and calls him as “Nadaathoorammaal”.
Udaiyavar, Sri Ramanujar, stayed in this sthalam and explained about Vaishnavam and made it grow. Vedantha Desikar in his Hamsa Sandesam has done Mangalaasasanam.
In front of big pillar in his temple, when we make any sound, it replicates and echo around the temple. Because of this, some of paasurams in Divyapprabhandhams are said for 2 or 3 times.
The big festival takes place on the third day of Panguni (March-April) every year when the Lord and Goddess are taken on a procession to the Coloroon river.One can see the Srirangam temple from here, though it is 15 kms away.
The Moolavar of this Sthalam is Pundarikashan.Moolavar in standing position facing east direction.Prathyaksham : Garudan, called as “Periya Thiruvadi”, Sibi chakravarthy, Bhoomi Piratti, Maarkandeya Maharishi, Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva.
Shenbagavalli. Also called as “Peri Piraattiyaar Lakshmi Devi”. Seperate sannadhi for Thaayar. Utsavar thaayar is named as “Pangajavalli”.
When our house is filled with praise, it is also filled with God. As we surround ourselves with praise, we surround ourselves with the Presence of God. I have perceived that every time I celebrated nights of praise and worship in my home when I lived in Florida, United States of America. The atmosphere of the house was transformed and the presence of God could be felt intensely.
God is present and His presence is manifested by the strong display of His power. This position is premeditated, without pretending a mystical presence, but deepening in the reality of who God really is. We are not talking about the simple praise that touches our soul and makes our skin crawl, but about the one in which God is here and His Kingdom has come. This is how God reveals Himself as He chooses to descend and dwell in His church.
The word that is translated as praise in Psalm 22:3 is tehillâh (הלָהִתְֶ, H8416), which means laudation; specifically (concretely) a hymn: praise. Tehillâh appears 57 times during all periods of the Hebrew biblical history. First, the term denotes a quality or attribute of some person or thing; it means glory or praiseworthy.
God is and should be our main reason for praise. When everyone looks at what God has done for us, words of praise can only come from our lips for Him. Israel is the glory of God when it exists in a state of exaltation and divine blessing. The exaltation of God is praise, it is recognizing who He is, His attributes and His wonderful works for His people. When Israel exalts their God, the presence of the Most High is felt and the place where He is exalted is filled with His glory.
A few years ago I attended a service where an African pastor preached. I was struck by something he said about the way they praise in African churches. This pastor told us that in Africa many of the parishioners must walk up to 3 hours to get to the temple and, therefore, they would not be satisfied just by listening to four or five songs. In this regard, he said that the time of praising God was not limited and could last several hours. During that time people remained ecstatic looking for the presence of God.
The African pastor said that at the end of the praise time, it usually continued with a long line of people giving testimony of the healing and miracles that happened in their lives while praising. No doubt that God makes room among this African people in the midst of its praise. And He will do it wherever He is praised without limits. If we really want Him to live among us, let us praise Him with all our heart. God bless you.

After achieving significant gains in student performance, Tincher Preparatory School has become the first Long Beach school, and the first K-8 school in the state, to be named a “School to Watch” by the California Middle Grades Alliance.
State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell recently announced that Tincher and only two other schools statewide earned the honor.
“Congratulations to all the students, their teachers and administrators, and the parents who are working hard to make these schools examples of educational excellence,” O’Connell said.
Tincher was recognized for its success in four areas: implementing best practices focused on academic achievement; responding to the developmental needs of adolescents; offering an equitable education for all students; and instituting processes and procedures that sustain academic growth.
To be named a Schools To Watch–Taking Center Stage designee, schools must have met all state Academic Performance Index growth targets for the previous three years. Tincher also conducted a rigorous self-study and completed a narrative application. A team of experts visited Tincher in December.
“They liked what they saw in regard to the culture of our school, the academic success, the teamwork of staff, and the partnership between the parents, the kids and the staff,” said Tincher Principal Bill Vogel. Tincher’s API score rose 46 points schoolwide in the past three years. In that time, the African American subgroup narrowed the achievement gap by 24 points, and Latinos by 62 points. Tincher is a diverse school with more than 50 percent of its students designated as disadvantaged. This subgroup has improved by 53 points over the same period. Tincher's API score stands at 845, well above California’s target of 800.
The other two winners this year are Clark Intermediate School in Fresno’s Clovis Unified School District, and Dartmouth Middle School in Santa Clara County’s Union School District. This year’s winners will be recognized at the March 13 to 15 California League of Middle Schools conference in San Diego.
Be sure your family is counted when the 2010 U.S. Census kicks off this spring. The nationwide tally takes place every 10 years, and the results determine how federal funds are spent for schools, highways, housing, health, social services, economic stimulus and more.
In local schools, Census data also help to determine funding for breakfast and lunch programs, special education, college grants and loan programs. Every year, the federal government allocates more than $400 billion to states and communities based, in part, on census data.
The Census Bureau will deliver questionnaires to all U.S. households in March. You can help make sure the count is accurate by filling out and returning this short form by Census Day, April 1, 2010. The form consists of 10 questions, takes 10 minutes and affects 10 years' worth of funding for our schools. If you don't return the form in time, Census volunteers will knock on your door to offer help.
The Long Beach Unified School District is partnering with the Census to allow distribution of informational fliers to parents. Schools may also consider having a “Census in Schools Week” to raise awareness.
The U.S. Constitution requires a national census to determine the number of seats each state will have in the House of Representatives.
Edison Elementary School has won the 2007 National Center for Urban School Transformation’s Excellence in Education Award. Only seven schools were selected as winners nationwide. To compete for the award, schools must meet a long list of student performance criteria, including attainment of national Adequate Yearly Progress goals, high attendance, low suspension rates and high percentages of students completing rigorous courses of study, or awards for school-wide excellence in academic disciplines. "We’re elated to be recognized with this high honor," Edison Principal Matty Zamora said. "We cried tears of joy when we heard the news. We’re all so proud of what everyone at this school has accomplished. This was a total team effort of community members, teachers, students and staff." The award will be presented in May during NCUST’s symposium on high performing schools, where winners of the award will share their success stories with more than 400 educators from throughout the nation. Also scheduled to be honored is the Long Beach Unified School District’s Signal Hill Elementary School, one of 18 finalists for the award. Criteria for the award are based on 20 years of research into what separates high performing urban schools from lower performing schools, said Pamela Engler, administrative coordinator for NCUST, which notified the winning schools last week. Among those key criteria are rigorous curriculum, strong performance across all subgroups of students, and positive relationships among parents, teachers, the principal and other school leaders. Edison, located in downtown Long Beach, has shown strong academic growth in recent years. In math, for instance, approximately 84 percent of Edison students are now proficient, up from 37 percent just three years ago. The school’s state Academic Performance Index has grown to 796, up 119 points in the last two years and now just four points shy of the state’s target of 800 for all schools. Edison serves high numbers of socioeconomically disadvantaged children, with 99 percent of students receiving free and reduced-price lunches. The NCUST award is Edison’s sixth award in the last two years. Last year, the school earned the prestigious California Distinguished School Award. Edison has been honored twice by the Long Beach Unified School District as a STAR high achieving school, and twice with the Title I Academic Achievement Award. The NCUST was founded as part of the QUALCOMM Institute for Innovation and Educational Success at San Diego State University. The other six national winners of the NCUST Award this year are schools in Mt. Vernon, N.Y.; Columbus, Ohio; Austin, Texas; Rancho Cucamonga, Calif.; Atlanta and Detroit.

To me, poetry is everywhere. It is the morning dog walks, the street I live on which is really an alley that usually smells like piss, the man standing on the adjacent roof staring into the next window at my Airbnb guests’ asses, making rice, making up excuses, making someone smile accidentally. It matters to me to translate all of this by putting it into words, because language is the main way, perhaps the only way, for humans to bring a concept, a feeling, a situation, a thing, anything, from perception to understanding. (What I’m saying is, poetry as we more formally know it, is this translation.)
With this, I could go really far into the interior universe, trying to figure out why understanding is important. I think that would be a digression from what I want to say, though, which is that there is a reason I have thought about and asked the question why does poetry matter in the first place. The reason is that most people don’t read poetry. It has become pretty obsolete as consumable media by being deemed as too difficult 🙁
This perception isn’t unfounded, per se. When most people first encounter poetry with a developed brain (by this I mean to exclude children’s books), they are studying it in school, and they begin with stuff that was written a long time ago. Because language is constantly evolving, it makes sense that something like Shakespeare or Beowulf or even Edgar Allen Poe is not intuitively understood. Further, in the early 20th century, a group of poets decided that poetry was an art meant for the elite class only, and as a result, much of it was written so that only those in that class of people who could afford an expensive education could understand it. That’s fucked up.
What I’m getting at is that if the introduction to poetry was, instead, the often highly accessible contemporary stuff, maybe the world would not be so averse to it. Like, imagine if the introduction to mathematics was calculus instead of arithmetic. It doesn’t make sense to do it that way, because you have to build off of your understanding arithmetic to even begin to comprehend calculus. I imagine the same is true for poetry.
Whatever. While it is too bad that it is taught that way, giving people a false perception that ALL poetry is a type of media that takes extensive work and studying in order to understand, it is the way it is.
I want to change that, however I can. Why? Personally, I think many people would find their connection with the outside world is enhanced by reading poetry, so they are royally jipping themselves by ignoring it. That’s why I started Sex on Sundaze, my poetry project where I write on people’s skin. Short, straightforward poems written on boobs and thighs and asses in the jungle or on the couch or standing at the edge of land looking off into the biggest ocean on earth. The marketing is a means to an end. If people like looking at images, bodies, often scantily clad, then I will write poetry there so that they will look at it and perhaps give it a chance.
That’s also why I designed my first poetry book with a structure that is meant to be fun. You can either read the book front to back, like normal, or you can follow the instructions at the end of each page. Because the book is a story in poems, the idea is that each reading will provide a different story. Think choose-your-own-adventure-ish style.
Almost a month ago, I started a Kickstarter campaign to help raise the money to publish the book. Maybe you’re familiar with the life I’ve chosen for the time being, where I put writing and poetry before a more traditional career, eating a lot of canned tuna and white rice? Haha, I don’t mind, but publishing a book was out of the question without some crowdfunding, and so my Kickstarter for You Had Me At Topography was born. One of the things I did to promote the campaign was make a video where I asked a few people why poetry matters to them. It was awesome to hear what people had to say:
Well, I reached my goal with lots of time to spare. Woohoo!!! (seriously!!!). Maybe poetry does matter to more people than I thought? Or, I just have a lot of really loving and supportive friends and family around me. Which one it is, I suppose I will never know…
Anyway, that’s when I thought of another idea, something that would make the book even more attractive to a wider audience: what if I include a soundtrack, or really two soundtracks (one for each reading of the book) to accompany it, like the music in a movie helps or guides people so that they can more easily connect with it and understand it. That’s where I am now, super close to making that happen 🙂
Now I’m sitting here thinking, I didn’t really intend for this to just be a Kickstarter promotion in all seriousness, (though if you want to donate, there’s definitely karma and gifts in it for you, hahah), so why the eff do I feel like a salesperson all of a sudden? The world is so tricky. Luckily, this struggle is also poetry, just like the dog walking and the pissy street I live on, so I have to be ok with it (:
I want to (almost) close with a quote from someone who didn’t get a chance to participate in the video, but articulated rather poetically why poetry matters in a recent text:
It’s a-maz-ing how texting used to be considered categorically trivial, but the truth is, you can get a text that brings magic into the day. Which brings me to my next point: why does texting matter? Just kidding.
But for real, why did I write this blog? I wanted to talk about why poetry matters, not so much to convince anyone that it does, but to convince people at least to think about why it might.
Poetry is anything that seamlessly agrees with my soul. Philosophy is anything that serendipitously allows me to make sense of the world.

Clickbank makes it super easy to get your own product online and literally puts it in front of thousands of affiliates that are skilled enough to make tons of sales. Most people think that their only option is to become an affiliate and promote the Vendor's product. If you have skills or knowledge that others can benefit from - then why not create your own product?
Purchase Complete	In longer sales cycles, it may take more time for a purchase to be completed after you bring your customer to the merchant. This rewards generously for prospects you provide that actually buy.	A referral from your efforts negotiates with the merchant. After 3 months in their sales funnel, they close a deal and you are compensated a set percentage.
Shame on you for allowing such free access to your site by spammers, abusers and phishers. First of all, the product I bought was worthless and you did refund my money without question - but ever since the purchase I have been plagued with phishing emails, up to 5 or 6 a day. You are doing a great disservices to your vendors and their customers by not providing a secure site or, more questionably, actually selling customer information.
Mechanical Turk: Amazon's Mechanical Turk is a resource for doing human-intelligence tasks, or as the site commonly refers to them, HITs. You get paid a very small fee for any given HIT and you'll need a good deal of volume to make a substantial amount of money. But it is a resource you can use in your spare time to generate a small income online.

After reading all the benefits of affiliate marketing if you think you will be rich over night by selling affiliate products online then you are wrong. Affiliate marketing is definitely an excellent way to make money online but it’s highly competitive too. In order to be successful in Affiliate marketing you need to know the market needs, learn how to promote products, what works and what doesn’t. The following are a few tricks on becoming successful in affiliate marketing that I have learnt over time.
Carly I’m so happy for you! And thankful for all you have done. Your series for the Computer Confused and Tech Troubled really helped me turn things around with getting my blog going. I still got a long way to go, but I’m making progress. It’s so inspiring to see your September income report and that you’re doing something that will allow you to realize your dreams of staying home with your child. I couldn’t be happier for you!
Last but not least, you can also earn money online by building an online community, although the monetization strategies you can pursue will vary a lot depending on your goals. You can build a community with a blog, for example. You can also build an online forum and charge people for membership. You could even build up a Facebook group and use your influence there to sell and promote products.
The first thing to do is to join an affiliate program then select the products you intend to sell. The owners of the products would provide you with an affiliate code you can use for referring traffic to the main site. Also, you will be offered banners, text links and several forms of creative copies in which you just copy and paste the code on your own site to refer traffic. Any interested customer who clicks on the links from your website will be redirected to the main site where the product is sold and if they pay for the product or subscribe to a program/service and indicate you as the referral, you get a certain percentage as commission.
Etsy: While Etsy's popularity has declined recently, it's still a great resource for selling handmade items online. No need for complex ecommerce sites or merchant accounts or any sort of automation. The company takes a commission of every sale and charges a small listing fee per item. But many still use Etsy as their primary source of income. The best part is that you can also sell digital products on here such as poster designs.
Mechanical Turk is Amazon's take on micro-jobs. These are small miniscule-jobs that you can do for other people, which they call HITs, or Human Intelligence Tasks. These are super simple tasks that anyone can do. Some examples are listing off some URLs with certain kinds of images for one cent, or recording a few phrases with a microphone for 6 cents.
The first mistake a lot of affiliate marketers make is that they register with too many different affiliate programs and try to promote everything. Pursuing affiliate marketing down this path can become very overwhelming and you won’t be able to promote any product properly. All you need in order to be successful is a handful of good products to promote. Try to understand the market needs and look for products that align correctly with the topic of your site.
If you’re writing reviews, you should 100% be using rich snippets (they add review stars to your search engine snippets and increase click-through rates). There are many WordPress plugins for this but my favorite is WP Rich Snippets. It’s $69/year (or $399 one-time) and I use it for every single review I write. They have tons of add-ons, settings, styling options, and looks nice. Free plugins like All In One Schema.org do work but lack settings, styling, and flexibility.
Google Autocomplete – go to google.com, start typing a phrase and look at the dropdown autocomplete results. You can use the underscore character “_” to have Google fill-in-the-blank. Just make sure the last character you type is an underscore. Try using plurals and change the word ordering to see different results. This is how I find 90% of my keywords.
Understand how a niche website works. A niche website focuses on very targeted, specific information. The content must be specific, useful and interesting to your target audience. Successful niche websites get anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 visitors per month.[5] You build content on a particular keyword, and you make passive income with Google Adsense or through affiliate links.[6]

Working as a freelancer is a great way to make money online from the comfort of your own home. The beauty of freelancing is that you can tailor it to suit your needs. You can freelance for a couple of hours a week in the evenings to help save up for a holiday or some much needed home improvements. Or carve out a full-time job for yourself, giving you a more satisfying work-life balance and enabling you to do the simpler things in life like taking the kids to school. With so many jobs available online, freelancing is becoming more and more popular.
Answer surveys to earn money from home. Survey companies I recommend include Swagbucks, Survey Junkie, American Consumer Opinion, Pinecone Research, Opinion Outpost, Prize Rebel, and Harris Poll Online. They’re free to join and free to use! You get paid to answer surveys and to test products. It’s best to sign up for as many as you can as that way you can receive the most surveys and make the most money.
What this article teaches you is that if you produce something that is shareable and interesting, driving traffic to it is MUCH easier. You can use social media, you can run link building, you can share it on niche communities and nobody is going to ban it or downvote it. Actually, if your front end is great value, people will share it around without you asking. Then all you have to do is offer a free downloadable resource in this piece of content (that does not decrease its shareability as it's more free goodies) and THEN start selling via email follow up.
Using ClickBank for promoting your product is easy and need simple steps to do. As a product owner to sell your product on ClickBank, all you need is a vendor account. You have to set up an account and fix the product price. After approval, ClickBank will provide you the special code for product sale link or button which you will put on your website.
Theme – you don’t need a special theme for affiliate marketing, you probably just need a blog. I recommend StudioPress themes since that’s what Yoast, Matt Cutts (from Google), and I use. Matt Mullenweg, founder of WordPress also recommends them. One of the biggest mistakes I made was using a theme from Themeforest… since they’re built by independent developers who may stop making updates to their theme. This happened to me and I hear horror stories all the time about people having to switch themes and redesign their entire site. I’ve been using the same StudioPress theme (Outreach Pro) for 3 years. Their themes are lightweight (load fast), SEO-friendly via optimized code, secure, and they have a huge selection of plugins for the Genesis Framework and an awesome community in the Genesis WordPress Facebook Group. They include documentation for setting it up and will serve you for many, many years.
Internet scams had become a real problem – My mission is to review all the popular programs that is marketing related like; home based internet business opportunities, services or the newest bizops. Please note that reviews are based on my opinion or general experience with the product or service. Be protected against scams by knowing the basic types of online fraud like spam, phishing and identity theft and how it can be avoided.
If you’re writing reviews, you should 100% be using rich snippets (they add review stars to your search engine snippets and increase click-through rates). There are many WordPress plugins for this but my favorite is WP Rich Snippets. It’s $69/year (or $399 one-time) and I use it for every single review I write. They have tons of add-ons, settings, styling options, and looks nice. Free plugins like All In One Schema.org do work but lack settings, styling, and flexibility.
I went from making $20k in 2016 to $100k in 2017 by dropping my web design/SEO clients and doing affiliate marketing/blogging full-time. 90% of my (passive) affiliate income comes from SiteGround, a hosting company who awarded me affiliate of the month in July, 2017 when I made $9k in 1 month. Since then I’ve continued to hit numbers like this – the screenshot below is from March, 2018 when I made $14.5k in 1 month (just with SiteGround).
Thirsty Affiliates tracks, cloaks, and categorizes your affiliate links. Once you’ve signed up for your program(s) grab your affiliate links and add them to this plugin. This can take time if you will be linking to multiple pages on your affiliate’s website (which in many cases, you should). The pro version comes with statistics but I don’t even use it and I’m quite the analytical person.
First I want to just say well done with what you have accomplished. You have done an amazing job. I’m not really one to post a comment on blogs as I’m sure everyone says. But the thing that struck me the most about you is I can tell your a great individual. You love cats, as my wife and I do. We also have rescue cats. You are a very generous and honest person and that is most likely why you also have done well. Very authentic and honest. I’m in the process of building an affiliate amazon site. So I can relate to the content side of things. I’m already a customer of siteground but If I wasn’t I’d happily sign up through you. I have bookmarked your site as I’d like to come back and read a little more and keep an eye on your progress. Thanks for taking the time to write this post. It’s one of the best blog posts I’ve read. Take care Tom
Is there a product or service that you are particularly enthusiastic about? If you are, you may be able to develop a website that is built around selling it. You don’t have to be the actual provider of the product or service either. There are many businesses that offer these products and will allow you to sell them on an affiliate basis. For example, you may be able to sell a product on your website for a commission of 20% or 30% of the sale price.

Unfortunately, various artist compilations that introduce unknown artists under one unified release often tend to be rather hit-or-miss. I've ran across that situation many, many times in my years of listening to music, and instead of having the patience to jump around from one artist I like to another, I sometimes find myself giving up on the release as a whole and waiting for the individual artists to release something of their own.
To cut to the chase, 4 Women No Cry is one of the better multiple-artist compilations that I've heard in some time. Featuring from four to six tracks from four different unreleased female artists, it's literally a global journey through work from several different talented artists who will no doubt find homes for even more of their work after this release finds a way into the ears of the world. With artists hailing from Buenos Aires, Paris, Vienna, and Tblisi, there truly is a wide variety of geographic range involved, yet the release has a surprising cohesiveness as well, as all the artists work with an electronic/acoustic palette that helps the release flow together very nicely.
Opening the release is Argentinian singer Rosario Bléfari, and while the release is really great overall, I have to pick out her work as some of the best. Mixing programmed beats, field recordings from the city and country, and occasional warm acoustic guitar melodies (along with a voice that recalls Bebel Gilberto), all four tracks from Blefari have a buoyancy that just reminds me of life in the springtime when everything is basked in sun and moving and/or growing. Tusia Beridze follows with several tracks, and her more subdued works work a more cinematic angle as quiet, subdued vocals blend with strings, spoken-word passages, and subtle programming. If the works of Bléfari bely the work of someone living in Argentina, then those of Beridze have the (admittingly stereotypical) tone of Eastern Europe (where she makes her home) with their slightly more detached feel.
Èglantine Gouzy follows, and her work is much more punctuated with crisp programming and tracks that alternate between short vignette and pieces that sound like the French equivalent of The Postal Service. The final artist is Austrian Catarina Pratter, and her work is possibly the most varied of the three. The long track "Dreamin Of Love" alone sounds like several songs in one as it shifts from weird minimal dancefloor singalong to gurgling pop. Her track "Policeman" glitches out a piano jazz loop under some spoken-word vocals and stutter hi-hats while the closer "Stronger Than Before" is a dark, lumbering slab of experimental electronic pop.
The final tally is twenty different tracks and well over an hour worth of music from four female artists who are all doing their own thing and creating some really great music in the process. In addition to the artists I already mentioned in reference in the review above, fans of everyone from Juana Molina to Björk should hunt down this excellent compilation from Monika Enterprise. Thoroughly enjoyable.

What 1 Chronicles 16:27 says is similar to what we read in Psalms 96:6: Give honor and praise to the Lord, whose power and beauty fill His holy temple. The word that is translated as praise in both biblical texts is Hôd (הוֹד, H1935), grandeur (that is, an imposing form and appearance): beauty, comeliness, excellency, glorious, glory, goodly, honor, majesty. Hôd is one of the nine words used in the Old Testament that are translated as praise.
The greatness and majesty of God are more than enough reasons to praise Him continuously. No one, no human being, no beast, no spirit, no celestial star could reach the immense stature of our God, Lord and King forever. The appearance of God is awesome, incomparable. Only to imagine the extension of the universe, which is impossible to measure, and to know that His Creator is much greater than that, should impel us to not stop praising him any day of our life.
But the meaning of the original Hebrew text of 1 Chronicles 16:27 and Psalms 96: 6 implies, in addition to greatness and majesty, other attributes of God. He is worthy of all praise, all honor and all reverence. Whoever believes can see the glory of God according to the Scripture, He is glorious! And along with His praise, we can see the magnificence before Him. God is noble in every sense of the word. He is noble because he acts in good faith, without any malice or double intention. He is also noble by His majesty and royalty.
Hôd also refers to another quality of God, His power. Psalms 89:13 says: You have a mighty arm; strong is Your hand, and high is Your right hand. And also Psalms 140:7 says the following: O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of battle. The potency of God is insurmountable and leads us to victory when He fights battles for His children and for His people. Our powerful savior deserves to be praised all the time, day by day and in every moment.
But God is much more than powerful, He is Omnipotent! In Exodus 6:3 God says to Moses: I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name Lord[a] I was not known to them. The word that translates as Almighty is Shadday (שׁדּי; H7706) which means Almighty. One of the best-known passages of the Psalms also uses this word, Psalms 91:1 says: He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
Who will not give praise when he is before Shadday, the Almighty, the Most High, the great, the worthy, who is full of glory? His is the honor, His is the honor forever. We praise His greatness, His majesty, His magnificence and His nobility. God bless you.

“Saturday Night Fever” – Swag. Oh yeah! Who didn’t love John Travolta in this movie – the guy defines swag with his strut and attitude. Whatever dance floor you’re on, bring it people! Such fun dance routines, and it’s one of the best soundtracks ever. How deep is my love for this movie?
“Billy Elliot” – Courage. What’s not to love about this heart-warming story about a young boy who is surprised by his love of dance and goes against society’s norms to earn a spot at the Royal Ballet school. He’s only 11, yet he chooses to follow his dream instead of letting other people discourage him. Awesome!
“Flashdance” – Determination. I loved this movie not only for the dancing but also because of the important message it conveyed – NEVER GIVE UP! Life will always be challenging, but it takes true character to stay on track and keep chasing your dreams.

I’ll admit it, I’m quite the gadget geek! I love finding new gimmicky products especially if they are there to benefit me. Today I’m talking to you about the award winning Phillips Diamond White electric toothbrush. I have been using an electric toothbrush for a few years now, I was always more of a manual toothbrush kinda girl until I gave in and gave the electric a go since then I’ve not gone back. I originally had an oral b one which had lasted me years but it was time for an update and this is it!
Whats so special about this electric toothbrush? Let me tell you! This toothbrush doesn’t just have the one bog standard setting oh no, this in fact has five different settings which are all written and illuminated on the brush; Clean, Whiten, Gum Care, Polish and Sensitive. I have mine on the Sensitive setting because it’s powerful yet gentle, I feel rather professional whilst brushing my teeth now it literally feels like I’ve just had a polish at the dentist my teeth are left squeaky clean and uber fresh. It also has a 2 minute timer which is very clever and super handy and produces an impressive 31,000 brushstrokes a minute!
Enough about the settings, now lets move on to charging this little beauty. We are not just going to sit this on a random plug charger oh no, we are going to place it in a rather chic glass and let it charge whilst it’s in there relaxing. Simply plug into a shaver point and let the glass to the magic! If you like to travel a lot then you’ll enjoy the gorgeous silver casing it comes with a USB charger which includes a mini USB slot placed on the outer edge, it’s super clever and the case itself fits everything you need including the toothbrush body and two brush heads. There are two brush head sizes available, I like to use the larger one because I feel it cleans my teeth better but the smaller one is fab and promises to deliver gentle and efficient cleaning. Finally the battery life on this toothbrush is very impressive, 3 weeks!!! I mean come on that is amazing, the power even at the end of the 3 weeks is still great, there is an indicator that changes from green to orange when you need to get charging. I just leave mine over night in that gorgeous glass and I’m ready the next day to give my pearly whites a clean again.
Overall I am loving the Philips Diamond White Toothbrush, I will admit it is a rather expensive toothbrush and there may be cheaper alternatives out there but my smile is very important to me and i believe investing in something like this is important, not only will it last you years but it really does work to give you a brighter whiter smile in just a matter of weeks. A couple of my teeth tend to overlap making them much more prone to plaque build up no matter how much I floss and this toothbrush has got rid of a considerable amount of plaque and it’s now gone. I am feeling confident and happy again with my smile and it’s all down to this toothbrush.

LC Environment, founded by Luc Lévesque, is a symbol of innovation, ingenuity and sustainable development. The company works with many different European and Canadian businesses, in order to allow them to re-use their residual materials in a profitable and environmentally friendly way.
By developing partnerships between different companies in widely varied lines of business, we identify the materials that can be reused and resold. In this way, what would have otherwise been thrown away can become profitable. For example, a retail chain can dispose of large quantities of cardboard packaging, plastic and styrofoam that will be used by manufacturing companies. The residual materials of one become the raw materials of another. What a great example of the environmental sector!
Our equipment can allow you to recycle cardboard, styrofoam, plastic (rigid or film) and non-ferrous metals.

Two fundamental lines of work converge in the art of Andreas Fogarasi (Vienna, 1977): a reflection on the role that architecture plays in our society, as a lure to draw tourists and investors, and, in a more minimal vein, an emphasis on the importance of materials, structures and design. Having studied both architecture and fine art, he unites these interests to produce works that are sculptural in appearance and highly documentary in content, using them to analyse how things are presented to us and how culture influences urban development.
Fogarasi’s rise to artistic prominence has been meteoric. In 2007 he represented Hungary at the Venice Biennale, where he won the Golden Lion for best pavilion with his video project Kultur und Freizeit about the different purposes for which various Budapest cultural centres have been used. The videos were shown inside six semi-theatrical devices or “black boxes” resembling minimalist objects. In addition to filming the buildings, between shots the camera zoomed in on details of the walls, facades and other surfaces. The project now presented at the Casado Santapau Gallery focuses on the video oeuvre of this artist who, though no stranger to installation, sculpture, photography and writing, admits that this is the medium in which he feels most comfortable. When working with video, he does everything himself, from research and filming to editing, and he chooses to exhibit his creations in a highly sculptural way. In Fogarasi’s opinion, “videos are not about time but about space” and, as we see in Kultur und Freizeit, all of them are designed to be presented in a very specific, clearly-defined format, which is why he never sends them to festivals.
The videos selected for this exhibition—Kinetic Gate, Surface Studies – Karlsplatz and Budapest—were produced at different moments in his career. The oldest of the three, Kinetic Gate (1999-2012), features a functioning design by the Hungarian artist Victor Vasarely, father of Op Art and a central figure in several of Fogarasi’s projects. The other two videos are shot in a documentary style and pay close attention to architectural structures and details of building materials. Surface Studies – Karlsplatz (2007) sketches a portrait of the city of Vienna and its inhabitants based on the different paving materials used around the square named in the title. It is accompanied by another work on paper that captures the texture of surfaces in two Los Angeles buildings using frottage. This piece is part of a series entitled Donor Recognition Structures (2006), in which donor plaques at the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, provide a pretext for investigating the institutional use of art and culture.
The third and most recent video, created specifically for this show, is Budapest (2015). In it, the artist immortalises the materiality of a city that many people are being forced to leave due to the recession by filming new buildings, places of transit and other urban environments. He uses architecture to freeze time and document a social reality. This project was preceded by Mirror (Móricz Zsigmond körtér, Budapest) (2013) and other works in a photographic series which focused on developing areas in that same city. Fogarasi always takes photographs when he travels, planning out his route in advance with the help of guides specialised in architecture. Sometimes he snaps close-ups of well-known buildings, and at other times his subjects are ephemeral structures like fair booths and displays. A case in point is Togliatti Poster Stand (DIN A4) (2005), a billboard he stumbled across in that Russian city and recreated in his studio with a model, carefully measured to ensure that the advertising space would be the exact size of an A4 sheet of paper.
Anyone familiar with his work and the importance he attaches to the mise en scène knows that Andreas Fogarasi’s pieces and exhibitions have to be experienced in person. In Madrid, he will transform the white cube of the new space at the Casado Santapau Gallery into a place where projections dialogue with objects placed on rough wooden furniture. Almost simultaneously, at tranzit.ro/ (Iasi, Romania) and amt-project (Bratislava) he will present Installation and Photography, two solo exhibitions which, like Video, allow the artist to reflect on the media with which he works.

This is an original one of a kind work of art that has been printed on Hahnemuhle 310gsm photo rag using Epson's archival Ultra Chrome HD inks, and mounted to an acid free art board. It’s been hand embellished with professional grade GOLDEN artist's acrylic painting medium to give three dimensional brushstrokes to the portrait, Initialed and dated in acrylics, and varnished with Gamblin’s Gamvar non-yellowing and removable painting varnish. It was created using a combination of digital painting and photo manipulation based on my own photography.
I've been doing a few photo shoots with some local models so that I can start basing my artwork on my own photography, and this is the first finished piece from the recent shoots.
I'm really liking the idea of my upcoming artwork being completely original and based from my own photos. Photography is in itself an artform, and I think creating this way gives my work a greater sense of depth.

It extends along the Atlantic coast from Buenos Aires to Tierra del Fuego. It includes widely different areas, from mudflasts and crab-crowded coastal marshes to vast sandy and rocky beaches at the foot of high cliffs, very important for both, resident and migratory bird species. Numerous species of penguins, cormorants, terns, gulls and shorebirds feed and nest along this vast littoral, located mainly in Patagonia. Among many interesting hotspots we can mention Punta Rasa, Bahia Blanca Estuary, Valdes Peninsula, Punta Tombo, Cabo Dos Bahías, Puerto Deseado, Cabo Blanco, Monte León N.P, Río Gallegos Estuary and the Beagle Channel, in Tierra del Fuego.
Going strong pa din! Video of Sarah Geronimo and Matteo Guidicelli as they go shopping in a mall caught on video
Popstar Princess Sarah Geronimo and Kapamilya actor Matteo Guidicelli became one of the favorite couples in Philippine showbiz.
Although they managed to keep their relationship low-key, fans of the couple can't seem to prevent themselves from prying on their personal affairs.
KAMI obtained a video from the YouTube channel called Pinas Idols, where the cute couple can be seen shopping in a mall.
Gianmatteo Fernan Guidicelli, most commonly known as Matteo Guidicelli is a Filipino actor, model, karting driver, triathlete and singer.

They were the ones who started appending the "ans" to the end of their names to signify a certain fandom.
Fans of Nora Aunor called themselves as "Noranians," while fans of Vilma Santos referred to themselves as the "Vilmanians."
KAMI saw on Bandera that at the start of the year, there was news that a movie under Star Cinema will be done by Vilma and Nora.
Of course, fans from both sides of the fence saw it as a good welcome for the year considering that the two have never been in a movie together.
However, when Bandera asked the Jojo Lim, the president of the fan club Vilma Santos Solid Intenational, he responded that he was likewise surprised by the news.
The next morning, Jojo forwarded to Bandera the response of Ate Vi regarding the rumored 2018 movie.
"Nope!! Wala pa akong nakakausap plus got really very busy ng November/December!!! Now pa lang ako naka-break nitong holidays," says Cong. Santos.
So that's it, fans of both Vilma and Nora may just have to wait for a movie, but it may not be coming this year.
The rivalry between fans - Noranians versus Vilmanians, was quite heavy during the heydays of the two actresses.

Since the early 60's the Foundation has built schools, bridges, hospitals and clinics, and has planted more than one million seedlings in the Khumbu.
Administered by volunteer help, this organization has built schools and drinking water systems since 1974 in the remote south-east region of Nepal.
Foster Parents Plan, a member of PLAN International, has been working in Nepal since 1978. As with all countries where they work, they know that to help a child in a lasting way, they must also help his or her family and the local community to become self-sufficient.
Through child sponsorship, they work with families and communities for as long as it takes to strengthen their capacity to provide their children with stability, protection and security in a way that is sustainable. Sponsorship contributions are not given directly to the Foster Children. Instead, they are used to strengthen community development, benefiting the child, family and entire community.
Foster Parents Plan programs encompass all components of a child's well-being, including health, education, habitat, family income generation and the very special aspects of cross-cultural learning and relationships.
Foster Parents Plan works in the regions of Rautahat, Makwanpur (south west of Kathmandu), Banke (on the Indian border), Dharan, Sunsari/Morang and Sallyan. Projects in these areas range from building health clinics to teaching children and adults to read and write to training communities members in improved agricultural techniques.
Our work with the school started in 1994. At that time, the school consisted of 3 classrooms and principal’s office, 2 teachers and an enrolment of 25 children. The floor was earth – the walls brick with open space below the tin roof. Currently, the school has grown to an enrolment of 75 children taught by 4 teachers. The building has been closed in with windows and doors, wood walls and floor. Blackboards and desks have been added to each of the five classrooms. An ample playground is located directly in front of the school building.
With the completion of the school building in 2004, we now fund the salary for one additional teacher. The balance of salaries is covered by the government of Nepal.
Donations may be made to the NEPAL SCHOOL FUND c/o Everest Trekking, 2517 York Ave. Vancouver, BC V6K 1E3.
Seva's overall goal is to save and restore sight through locally run programs in the Himalaya. They are supported with matching grants from CIDA.
TRAS was founded in 1962 by George Woodcock to help the Tibetan refugees. Over the past 40 years, we have been active in community projects and child sponsorship and have expanded to assist all peoples of the Trans-Himalayan region.
Currently we have projects in Tibet, Nepal and India featuring sanitation, conservation, immunization, basic education, literacy for women and vocational training.
Our individual child sponsorship program has enabled many children to have a secure upbringing and education. Some of these children are now adults and in a position to provide help themselves. For example, Dorje Namgyal, who was a TRAS sponsored child, is the founder and current principal of the Buddha Memorial Children's Home in Kathmandu, Nepal.
Absolutely fundamental to diving in the sea is an understanding of tides and currents. This page explains the basics:-
Divers need to have an understanding of tides since tidal movement will have a major influence on sea dives and the launching of boats.
The maximum water level is called high tide; the minimum level is low tide. The time between high tide and low tide is called ebb or falling tide, the time between low tide and high tide is called flow, flood, or rising tide. At any given point on the ocean, there are normally two high tides and two low tides each day.
On average, high tides occur 12 hours 24 minutes apart. The 12 hours is due to the Earth 's rotation and the 24 minutes to the Moon's orbit. The 12 hours is half of a solar day and the 24 minutes is half of a lunar extension, which is 1/(29-day lunar cycle).
The tides at a given place in the Earth's oceans occur about an hour later each day. Since the Moon passes overhead about an hour later each day, it was long suspected that the Moon was associated with tides. It is the combined gravitational pull of sun and moon that cause tidal flows. The moon causes about 66% of that effect and the sun 32%.
The earth rotates every 24 hours and during that time there will be two high tides (flood) and 2 low tides (ebb). However the moon is also rotating around the earth, taking about a month to do so. The net effect of this is that tides patterns change every 24 hours and 52 minutes.
Consider a water molecule in the ocean. whilst it is attracted gravitationally by the earth, it also experiences a much smaller gravitational attraction from the moon (much smaller because the Moon is much further away and much less massive than the earth).
The water nearest to the moon will have a stronger pull than the water farther away. In this diagram there are two bulges because of the differential gravitational forces.
The ocean at point A is closer to the Moon and experiences a larger gravitational force than the Earth at point B or the ocean at point C. Because it experiences a larger attraction, it is pulled away from the Earth, toward the Moon, thus producing the bulge on the right side. Loosely, we may think of the bulge on the left side as arising because the Earth is pulled away from the water on that side because the gravitational force exerted by the Moon at point B is larger than that exerted at point C. Additionally the earth is rotating under these bulges. A given point on the surface will experience two high and two low tides for each rotation of the planet.
Every 27.3 days, the earth and the moon revolve around a shared point, so the tidal pattern repeats the cycle in that time frame.
Tidal times vary due to local geography. In extreme cases there is only a single low tide and high tide each day.
In most of the world, the time between high and low tide is consistent, approximately 12 hours and 25 minutes, which is why the high and low tides seem to advance by an hour each morning and evening, but low tide is not always half way between them. In some places the flood tide rises quickly after a long period of several hours of low water.
One of the most dramatic places in the world to watch a high tide is in the upper reaches of the Severn Estuary. There the high tide rolls in on a tidal bore, a wave that quickly travels up river against the prevailing current. The phenomenon is caused by the fact that the tide is funneled into a shallow narrow river from a broad bay. This area has some of the most dramatic differences in tidal height in the world.
When the moon and the sun are perpendicular to each other their respective gravitational pulls (to a degree) counteract each other. This results in weaker tides called neap tides. To the diver this indicates slower currents. In this diagram the moon is pulling the water one way and the sun another. In the UK neap tides occur about 2 days after the first and last quarter moons.
When the sun and the moon are lined up with the Earth as in the examples below, large tides are experienced. These are called spring tides. The effect on tides is about the same whether the sun and moon are lined up or, on opposite sides of the Earth. In the UK spring tides occur about two days after new and full moons.
Half of the Moon is always lit, not just the portion we see: however, sometimes we only see a profile of the lit portion of the Moon. Certain phases of the Moon result depending on its orbit, and the Moon's orbit is responsible for the phase changes we see.
Since we only see the lit portion of the moon that is facing earth, we see a moon phase. There are eight phases that the moon goes through and they always occur in the same order. The Sun's light seems to move from right to left across the surface of the Moon.
1. New Moon (Day 0). Sun and moon are in Conjunction.Moon is not visible because only the dark side is seen by the earth.This is the biggest of the two spring tides.
2. Waxing Crescent (Day 3 to 4). Between new moon and first quarter, visible as a crescent with the bow towards the West - waxing.
4. Waxing Gibbous (Day 11 to 12) Between first quarter and full moon, three quarters of the disc visible, called a Gibbous Moon, rounded side to the West, Waxing.
6. Waning Gibbous (Day 18 to 19) Between full moon and last quarter,Three quarters of the disc is visible, called a Gibbous moon, the more rounded side towards the West, waning.
7. Last Quarter (Day 22), moon 90 degrees West of the sun, in West Quadrature, visible as a half disc with it's bow towards the East - waning Neaps.
8. Waning Crescent (Day 25 to 26). Between last quarter and new moon visible as a crescent with its bow towards the East, waning.
Spring tides do not occur in UK waters until about 2 days after the new and full moon. Similarly Neaps occur about 2 days after the moon's quarters.The phases as shown above are explained below:
This is shown on an Admiralty chart and used in conjunction with magenta tidal diamonds. Details include Location, Set (direction) in degrees true, Rate (speed or drift), and time. 'Sp'. and 'Np' refer to speed and not tidal height. Also shown is the latitude and longitude of the diamond and the local port to which the tidal differences are related to.
A Tidal Stream Atlas does the same as above and gives a quick pictorial view of "Standard Ports".There is one hour printed per page and one page covers only one area.To find the set of the tide you must use either parallel rules or a protractor.
Tides Make until they reach springs and Take Off until they are neaps.When yachting you can either Stem which is to go against a tide or Run which is to go with the tide. Also if the wind is on the starboard side, the vessel is said to be on the starboard tack, if the wind is on the port side, the vessel is on the port tack.
UK tide tables are usually given in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), not British Summer Time (BST). Therefore add one hour between March 27th and October 23rd for BST.
There are two methods of calculating tidal height and water depth, one makes use of a 'tidal curve' and is preferred where you need to be as accurate as possible. The second method is known as the 'Rule of Twelfths' and can be easily calculated.
The level of water does not rise or fall at a constant rate throughout the 6 hour duration of a rising or falling tide, but the amount by which it will do so can be estimated mentally by means of the following rough guide:
Assume that after looking at the relevant tide tables, a party plan to dive a wreck at 4pm. The tidal range is 6 meters and the depth at low water (1 pm) is 10m.

Welcome to the Kansas Historic Resources Inventory (KHRI) database! The KHRI is administered by the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) at the Kansas Historical Society (KSHS) and is a searchable inventory of the state’s surveyed historic properties. This interactive database is intended to serve as an education and reference tool for preservation professionals and the general public, whether registered or non-registered users.
Registered Users are able to enter new or edit existing survey information into the survey database. In order to become a registered user, click here; registration is open to anyone.
Non-Registered Users can search all approved inventory files in the database and print information but cannot enter or edit information. Users may choose to search for specific properties or may use more general criteria to search for categories such as building types and architectural styles. The database can also be used to simply explore the surveyed historic resources in a geographic area.
Surveying is the process of identifying and gathering data on historic resources. It includes recording basic physical and historical information about a property, photographing it, and drawing a site plan. In other words, survey is a means of documenting historic resources and does not automatically result in the listing of a property in the National Register of Historic Places or Register of Historic Kansas Places. For more information on surveying, click here.
Be sure to refer to the Tutorial for detailed instructions on entering information into the KHRI. Contact KSHS at (kshs.survey@ks.gov or 785-272-8681 ext. 258), with any questions, and thanks for contributing!

Traditionally, the rehearsal dinner is a meal offered to Bridal Partyer the night before the wedding. Why is it called “rehearsal” dinner? Because typically, the couple and the bridal party, actually rehearse what they will do during the wedding the day after.
Nowadays it is more of a casual dinner celebrated the evening before the wedding, where families and friends mingle together before the "Big Day", and hence all guests are usually invited. Especially in the case of a destination wedding, when many guests have travelled a long way to reach your Wedding location in Italy, inviting all of them to a rehearsal dinner is considered a gesture of thankfulness. Contact us for ideas and options for rehearsal dinner venues among hotel restaurants and bars, local restaurants, pizzerias, trattorias and wine bars, that we will suggest based upon the bride and groom’s preferences, atmosphere, location of guests and budget.
There are no listed providers, for this type of service, in our Network. However, our wedding planners will find the right professional for you! Contact us!

Hello once again fellow scrappers! Today I'm presenting my interpretation of Anupama's 'White Space' challenge going on over at Berry71Bleu. 'White Space' is defined as a portion of a page left unmarked in visual arts.
I decided to leave two sections of my page as white space--the upper right hand corner & lower left hand corner.
I've used papers & a few embellishments from Kaisercraft's Forget Me Not collection which coordinated quite well with Marivic's Berry71Bleu tag.
This would be me with my fur baby Toby. I decided that Toby was due for a page. Even though my first son has arrived to our home --I still see Toby as my eldest 'son'. :-) Yes, I know he's a dog--but to me he's simply a child trapped in a pup's body. He taught me the meaning of unconditional love & he's still a very important member of the family.
It took Toby about 2 weeks for him to get used to this tiny little human in the house. He's been an only child for five years & had never seen a baby. So it was a big adjustment for him. After 3 1/2 months, Toby has pretty much adopted his less furry younger brother & protects him as if he were his own.
What I have with Toby is 'No Ordinary Love'--hence the title. It's the kind of unique love that can only be shared between man & his best friend or in this case, between a girl & her little fur baby.
I did much layering on this layout with foam dots & pop dots in between several of the layers in order to give my page a bit of dimension.
Of what has become a sort of tradition with my pages--here's my journaling stored in the form of a scroll. As mentioned in previous posts--I love attaching lengthy journaling and/or story telling to my pages. I used to always store them behind my pages because since they were so long--they would take up a lot of room on my layout. However, ever since I started storing my journaling in the form of a scroll--it's become almost a habit of mine & a trademark on my pages. Plus they also make for a really cute & unique type of embellishment!
If interested on how I go about making these scrolls--feel free to read up on a tutorial I made for them here.
I love this photo that my husband took of me & Toby. As usual, he looks as if he's smiling at the camera! Right next to my photo is a mini glass vial that I filled with seed beads from my stash.
This is my latest fave die! I love, love, love this hot air balloon die by La-La Land Crafts! Isn't it so very cute! It adds a brilliant touch to my layouts.
Finally, here's a closeup of Marivic's Berry71Bleu tag. These tags are like instant embellishments. You don't have to dig around your stash for too many embellishments if you have one of these tags handy. Just adhere them to your page & you're pretty much done! You can find more of Marivic's tags in her Etsy shop here.
As always, a big thanks for those of you who stop by for a visit. Make sure to play along with this month's Berry71Bleu WhiteSpace challenge if you can! There are some fabulous prizes up for grabs by UHK Gallery & 7 Dots Studio!
awww this is so sweet kay! you know i always love your beautiful layering. such a sweet image of you and your furbaby too :)
Love the layout and the dimension. Our dog Missy would give us the "fang" when we first brought our newborn home, and after a week or so, she'd fang us if we didn't respond to the baby's cries at first............she became guardian of the little one!
Hi Kay!! First of all I just want to thank you for the lovely, chatty comment you left for me on my blog :) It's always so nice to connect with another doggie-lover as we understand one another perfectly well when it comes to our fur-babies :) I have to tell you that I simply adore your work and the title of your page is "spot-on"!! Toby is adorable and the page you created around that beautiful photo takes my breath away. I totally love the way you do your journaling in the form of a scroll. It gives me a wonderful idea as often I have so much to say but no space in which to do it...lol! Definitely going to have a peek at your tutorial :) LOVE that little glass vial with the seed beads..what a beautiful touch and I just have to lay my hands on that gorgeous baloon die..lol! There are sooo many beautiful details on this page and I love every inch of it :)x

Even those of us who came to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum’s celebration of legendary Palestinian abstractionist Samia Halaby on Tuesday for the politics may have found ourselves blown away by the art. And despite Halaby’s distinction between them – “they are two separate disciplines” – at times the differences seemed minor, as the Palestinian and working-class struggle that has shaped much of her life found clear reflection in her decades of work.
14 years ago, on the 50th anniversary of the Kafr Qasem massacre, Halaby launched an exhibition to memorialize the 49 Palestinians under military occupation killed by Israeli border police while returning t their village on October 29, 1956. “It’s the essence of sumoud that Kafr Qasem resists, Palestine resists, Iraq resists, and Lebanon resists,” she wrote at the time. Last year, her work on the project became a book, Drawing the Kafr Qasem Massacre.
On Tuesday, Halaby opened her presentation with a clear declaration of the principles underlying this celebrated project. “I feel a tragedy every day when I hear of the oppressiveness that Palestinian children feel on a daily basis,” she said, displaying one of her many depictions of her native Jerusalem’s Dome of the Rock. “I would like to dedicate my work to benefit Palestinian children.”
But she went on to pose a different sort of challenge, defining the Dome – for her – as an object of aesthetic, not religious devotion, its glorious shades of gold and blue reflecting the Palestinian landscape as a whole. The latter position seemed striking in the context of Palestinian nationalism; the former, in the setting of an elite institution on Manhattan’s Upper East Side.
For those knowing nothing of her roots in Palestinian and Arab leftism, Halaby left little room for confusion about either her loyalties or their influence on her art. “I had the good fortune of visiting the liberated zone in Beirut during the class war of the 70s,” she said, adding later: “You can see me in relation to the Palestinian artists of the Intifada, and of the revolution in Beirut.”
And for those of us with no grounding in contemporary art, she offered accessible insights into the principles of abstractionism that have defined her decades of work in the field.
“There’s nothing I could do that would be as beautiful as this leaf,” Halaby said, describing the challenge of portraying the beauty of New Haven, Connecticut in the fall, which can be grasped without lifting a paintbrush. “It’s the product of an entire process of growth.”
Her solution, she said, lay in abstractionism. “If you want a painting as beautiful as what you’re looking at, you have to find a way to make the painting grow like an autumn leaf.”
Halaby’s love for her craft was clear. “When I tell you I love abstraction, it comes straight from the excitement I feel,” she said.
And this aesthetic position also seemed like an historical, if not a political one. “Abstraction is about the general principles,” she said. “For the first time in history, we’re using general principles, not showing single things at one time.”
Later, explaining her choice – controversial at the time – to depict the oppression of both Palestinians and native Hawaiʻians in a single work, Halaby explained: “I’m an abstract painter. I’m concerned with generalities.”

The invention relates to the field of computer systems. More specifically, the invention relates to software debugging.
Software debugging is the detecting, locating, and correcting of logical and/or syntactical errors in a computer program. Debug hardware is often included in a processor for use by a software debug program. Typically, the debug program uses the debug hardware to allow the programmer to examine data and check conditions during the execution of another computer program. Thus, the debugging features of a processor provide programmers with valuable tools for looking at the dynamic state of the processor.
A typical debug feature, when enabled, reports a debug event in response to a certain condition(s) being meet. The term "event" is used herein to refer to any action or occurrence to which a computer system might respond (e.g., hardware interrupts, software interrupts, exceptions, faults, traps, aborts, machine checks, debug events). Upon recognizing an event, a processor's event handling mechanism causes the processor to interrupt execution of the current process, store the interrupted process' execution environment (i.e., the information necessary to resume execution of the interrupted process), and invokes the appropriate operating system handler. Upon completing the servicing of the event, the invoked handler instructs the processor to resume execution of the interrupted process using the previously stored execution environment. The appropriate handler for debug events is the debug handler. Thus, in response to each debug event, the debug handler is executed. The debug handler is a portion of the debug program and it allows the programmer to perform a variety of debugging techniques. When the programmer is finished, the programmer can cause the debug handler to instruct the processor to resume the interrupted process using the process' previously stored execution environment.
One prior art processor which includes debugging hardware is the Intel.RTM. 80960KB manufactured by Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif. The 80960KB provides for a "branch-trace mode" and an "instruction-trace mode." When the instruction-trace mode is enabled, the processor generates an instruction-trace event each time an instruction is executed. Debug software can use the instruction-trace mode to "single-step" the processor--i.e., interrupt execution after each instruction to allow the debug software to perform various debug techniques. When the branch-trace mode is enabled, the processor generates an branch-trace event each time an instruction that causes a branch (also termed as a "jump") to be taken is executed. An instruction that causes a branch to be taken is one that causes the processor to transfer flow of execution to another instruction (e.g., a jump instruction, a branch instruction, etc..). A taken branch typically transfers the flow of execution in a non-sequential manner--i.e., to an instruction which does not sequentially follow the instruction causing the branch to be taken. A branch-trace event is not generated for conditional-branch instructions that do not result in a branch being taken.
One limitation of this prior art branch-trace mode is that the source address of the branch (i.e., the address identifying the instruction that causes the branch to be taken) is not stored. As a result, this source address is not available for use by the debug handler. One prior art method of capturing the source address of a taken branch is to use the instruction-trace mode in conjunction with the branch-trace mode. According to this method, the instruction-trace mode is used to single step the processor and the address of the previously executed instruction is stored during each instruction-trace event. As a result, when a branch-trace event occurs, the address stored in response to the most recent instruction-trace event is the destination address of the taken branch. However, this method lacks utility in that it greatly degrades performance because the instruction-trace mode causes an event to occur after the execution of every instruction.
Another prior art processor which includes debugging hardware is the Intel Pentium.TM. processor manufactured by Intel Corporation. The Pentium processor provides for a "single-step trap" which is enabled by a TF flag. When enabled, a single-step trap occurs after the execution of the current instruction. Debug software can use the single-step trap to single step the processor. One limitation of this prior art processor is that the INT instructions clear the TF flag. Therefore, software debuggers which single-step code must recognize and emulate INT n or INTO instructions rather than executing them directly. This results in additional overhead when single-stepping. Another limitation of this prior art processor is that additional circuitry had to be included to reconcile the single-step trap with the other events. This circuitry terminates single stepping if an external interrupt occurs. In addition, when both an external interrupt and a single-step interrupt occur together, this circuitry clears the TF flag, saves the return address or switches tasks, and examines the external interrupt input before the first instruction of the single-step handler executes. If the external interrupt is still pending, then it is serviced--i.e., that external interrupt's handler is executed. During the execution of the external interrupt's handler, the single-step trap is disabled. Upon completion of the external interrupt's handler, the processor returns to executing the single-step handler. Thus, operating system routines (such as the external interrupt handlers) are not normally run in single step mode. To run operating system routines in the single step mode, a INTn instruction which calls an interrupt handler must be single stepped. As a result, this processor does not allow single stepping to be enabled on operating system routines as they interact with other programs.
One prior art technique of debugging is "profiling." Profiling is the counting of the number of times each instruction in a routine or program is executed. This count information can be used to determine which sections of code are software performance bottlenecks. These sections of code may then be optimized or restructured to increase performance. The prior art method of profiling uses single-stepping. For example, a prior art profiling program executing on a Pentium processor stores a profiling handler as the debug handler and enables the single-step trap to cause an exception after each instruction. After execution of each instruction, the processor executes the profiling handler which increments a count corresponding to the executed instruction. A limitation of this prior art method is that it greatly degrades performance because an event occurs after the execution of every instruction. This degradation in performance is so severe that use of this method is impractical.
According to one aspect of the invention, an apparatus for providing the source address of an instruction which causes a branch to be taken (e.g., instructs the processor to transfer the flow of execution) is described. In one embodiment, a processor includes a circuit coupled to a source address storage area. In response to the processor executing an instruction which instructs the processor to transfer the flow of execution to another instruction, the circuit stores in the source address storage area the address of the instruction which is causing the transfer in flow of execution.
According to another aspect of the invention, a method for profiling is provided. According to this method, a starting address for execution is stored. Then for the instruction currently being executed, it is determined if that instruction will cause a branch from a source address to a destination address. If it was determined a branch will be taken, then the source address of the branch is stored in a source address storage area, the destination address of the branch is stored in another storage area, and a handler is executed. The handler stores indications indicating the instructions identified by the addresses within the address range defined by the starting address and the source address have been executed.

In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However, it is understood that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known circuits, structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the invention.
This application describes an invention for providing the source address of a taken jump which results in a breakpoint event. In addition, this application describes an invention for providing profiling using branch breakpoint events.
FIG. 1 shows a block diagram illustrating an exemplary computer system 100 incorporating the teachings of the invention. The exemplary computer system includes a processor 110, a storage device 120, a network 125, and a bus 140. Processor 110 is coupled to storage device 120 and network 125 by bus 140. In addition, a number of user input/output devices, such as a keyboard 130 and a display 135, are also coupled to bus 140. Processor 110 represents a central processing unit of any type of architecture, including a CISC or RISC type architecture. In addition, processor 110 could be implemented on one or more chips. Storage device 120 represents one or more mechanisms for storing data. For example, storage device 120 may include read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), magnetic disk storage mediums, optical storage mediums, and/or flash memory devices. While this embodiment is described in relation to a single processor computer system, the invention could be implemented in a multi-processor computer system. In addition, while this embodiment is described in relation to a 64-bit computer system, the invention is not limited to a 64-bit computer system.
FIG. 1 additionally illustrates that processor 110 includes an execution unit 142, instruction pointer register 147, suspended instruction pointer register 148, status register 150, suspended status register 160, control unit 170, debug control register 180, jump source register 192, and internal bus 144. Of course, processor 110 contains additional circuitry which is not necessary to understanding the invention.
Internal bus 144 couples the elements of processor 110 together. Execution unit 142 is used for executing instructions. Instruction pointer register 147 is used for storing an address of an instruction currently being executed by execution unit 142. Status register 150 is used for storing status information concerning the process currently executing on execution unit 142. The contents of instruction pointer register 147 and status register 150 make up the execution of environment of the process currently executing on processor 110.
Status register 150 includes an enable bit 152 for enabling and disabling recognition of branch breakpoint events. When enable bit 152 indicates an enable state, branch breakpoint events are recognized. In contrast, when enable bit 152 indicates a disable state, branch breakpoint events are not recognized.
Execution unit 142 includes a branch breakpoint unit 190. Branch breakpoint unit 192 includes circuitry for detecting whether a instruction currently being executed by said processor is causing a branch (also termed as a "jump") to be taken. An instruction that causes a branch to be taken is one that causes the processor to transfer flow of execution to another instruction (e.g., a jump instruction, a branch instruction, etc.). A taken branch typically transfers the flow of execution in a non-sequential manner--i.e., to an instruction which does not sequentially follow the instruction causing the branch to be taken. A branch breakpoint event is not generated for conditional-branch instructions that do not result in a branch being taken. While enable bit 152 indicates the enable state, branch breakpoint unit 192 transmits a signal each time it detects a branch is or will be taken. Upon receiving this signal from branch breakpoint unit 192, execution unit 142 recognizes a branch breakpoint event (also termed as a "break on jump event") and transmits the signal to jump source storage area 192.
In response to this signal, jump source register 192 stores the source address of the taken branch. In this manner, the source address of a taken jump is made available to the debug handler executed in response to the branch breakpoint event. This provides greatly improved performance over prior art processors that required the use of single stepping to provide the source address of taken jumps. While jump source register 192 is described as being a dedicated register for storing the source address, alternative embodiments could be implemented such that jump source register 192 is a general purpose register.
In response to each event (including branch breakpoint events), execution unit 142: 1) suspends execution of the current process; 2) copies the execution environment of the suspended process from instruction pointer register 147 and status register 150 into suspended instruction pointer register 148 and suspended status register 160, respectively; and 3) executes the appropriate handler.
FIG. 1 also illustrates that storage device 120 has stored therein debug software 122 for execution on processor 110 to provide for the debugging of other software (e.g., applications). Of course, storage device 120 preferably contains additional software which is not necessary to understanding the invention.
While the described embodiment stores the execution environment of the suspended process in registers on the processor, alternative embodiments could use any number of techniques for temporarily storing the execution environment of a suspended process. For example, see Shanley, Tom and Anderson, Don, ISA System Configuration, MindShare, Inc. (1993). In addition, while the described embodiment uses bits in registers on processor 110 for storing indications (e.g., enable bit 152), alternative embodiments could use any number of techniques. For example, alternative embodiments could store these indications off chip (e.g., in storage device 120) and/or could use multiple bits for each indication.
FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of exemplary circuitry for implementing branch breakpoint unit 190 according to one embodiment of the invention. FIG. 2 shows branch breakpoint unit 190 includes an OR gate 210 having as inputs a number of conditions. Each of these conditions indicates when a branch will or has been taken. The signals representing these conditions are generated by the execution pipeline(s). Thus, these conditions may be generated prior to, during, or after the execution of an instruction. Branch breakpoint unit 190 also includes an AND gate 220. The output of OR gate 210 is coupled to the input of AND gate 220. The other input of AND gate 220 is coupled to receive enable bit 152 from status register 150. Thus, if the output of OR gate 210 is high and branch breakpoint events are enabled, the output of AND gate 220 indicates a branch breakpoint event should occur. The output of AND gate 220 is coupled to node 230 for signaling a branch breakpoint event should be recognized. In addition, the output of AND gate 220 is coupled to jump source register 192.
Jump source register 192 is also coupled to receive the contents of instruction pointer register 147. In response to receiving the signal from AND gate 220 indicating a branch breakpoint event will occur, jump source register 192 stores the contents of instruction pointer register 147. In this manner, the source address of a taken branch is stored such that it is available for use by the debug handler executed in response to the branch breakpoint event. Thus, the jump source address is made available without the use of other debug modes, such as a single stepping mode. This greatly increases the performance of software debugging over prior art processors.
While one embodiment of branch breakpoint unit 190 has been described in relation to FIG. 2, alternative embodiments could use any number of different circuitry configuration to implement the invention. For example, in one alternative embodiment the jump source register is coupled to the output of OR gate 210, rather than the output of AND gate 220. In this alternative embodiment, the debug handler would need to be implemented such that a jump is not caused prior to the contents of the jump source register being accessed. As another example, another alternative embodiment could store the source address of the jump in memory (e.g., in a fixed location in memory, in a stack data structure in memory, etc.) As another example, the invention could be implemented in software.
FIG. 3 shows a flow diagram illustrating the operation of one embodiment of the invention. At step 300, one of the conditions indicating jump will be taken is received. From step 300, flow passes to step 310.
As shown in step 310, it is determined whether the branch breakpoint event is enabled. If the branch breakpoint event is enabled, a branch breakpoint event is caused and flow passes to step 320. Otherwise, flow passes to step 360. In the described embodiment, this determination is made by inspecting the state of enable bit 152.
As shown in step 320, the source address of the jump is stored in the jump source register and flow passes to step 330.
As shown in step 330, the execution of the current process is suspended and its execution environment is stored. From step 330, flow passes to step 340. In the described embodiment, processor 110 stores the current process' execution environment by copying the contents of instruction pointer register 147 and status register 150 into suspended instruction pointer register 148 and suspended status register 160, respectively.
At step 340, the debug handler is executed and flow passes to step 350. In one embodiment, the debug handler is a generic handler which services multiple events, including branch breakpoint events. The debug event handler knows which event has occurred by inspecting an event status register located on processor 110. The event status register stores a number of bits which indicate which event has occurred--e.g., when an event occurs (such as a branch breakpoint event), the state these bits is altered to indicate which event has occurred. Upon completion of the debug handler, flow passes to step 350. Typically, the last instruction of a handler to be executed is one which instructs the processor to resume the suspended process.
As shown in step 350, the execution environment of the suspended process is restored and execution of the suspended process is resumed. From step 350, flow passes to step 360. In the described embodiment, the execution environment of the suspended process is restored by copying the execution environment stored in suspended instruction pointer register 148 and suspended status register 160 into instruction pointer register 147 and status register 150, respectively.
FIG. 4 is an exemplary block diagram illustrating the branches taken during profiling according to one embodiment of the invention. FIG. 4 shows debug software 122 including an initialization routine 410 and a debug handler 420. In addition, FIG. 4 shows a routine 430 on which profiling will be performed. Routine 430 starts at address 440.
FIG. 5a shows a flow diagram illustrating the operation of initialization routine 410 according to one embodiment of the invention. The flow diagram starts at step 500. From step 500, flow passes to step 505.
At step 505, the starting address of the code to be profiled is stored as the current starting address and flow passes to step 510. In the example shown in FIG. 4, initialization routine 410 stores address 440 as the current starting address. In one embodiment, the current starting address is stored off chip (e.g., at a known location in storage device 120). However, alternative embodiments could store the current starting address in a storage area on processor 110.
As shown in step 510, the branch breakpoint event is enabled and flow passes to step 515. In the described embodiment, the branch breakpoint event is enabled by altering the state of enable bit 152 to indicate an enable state.
At step 515, the initialization routine instructs the processor to begin executing at the starting address of the code to be profiled and flow passes to step 520. In the example shown in FIG. 4, initialization routine 410 instructs the processor to begin execution starting at address 440.
At step 520, the flow diagram ends. In the example shown in FIG. 4, the processor begins executing routine 430 starting at address 440 as shown by line 1.
During the execution of routine 430, the processor eventually reaches an instruction corresponding to jump source address 450 which causes a jump to be taken to jump destination address 460. Upon detecting this taken branch, the steps in FIG. 3 will be performed starting at step 300. As previously described, flow passes from step 300 to step 310.
As shown in step 310, it is determined whether the branch breakpoint event is enabled. If the branch breakpoint event is enabled, a branch breakpoint event is caused and flow passes to step 320. Otherwise, flow passes to step 360. In the present example, the state of enable bit 152 was altered in step 510 to enable branch breakpoint events and flow passes to step 320.
As shown in step 320, the source address of the jump is stored in the jump source register and flow passes to step 330. In the example shown in FIG. 4, jump source address 450 is stored in jump source register 192 as previously described in relation to FIGS. 1 and 2.
As shown in step 330, the execution of the current process is suspended and its execution environment is stored. From step 330, flow passes to step 340. In the described embodiment, the processor executes the instruction causing the jump before the branch breakpoint event occurs. As a result, the jump destination address is stored in instruction pointer register 147 prior to the occurrence of the branch breakpoint event. However, the processor 110 stores the current processes execution environment by copying the contents of instruction pointer register 147 and status register 150 into suspended instruction pointer register 148 and suspended status register 160, respectively. Thus, the jump destination address is stored in suspended instruction pointer register 148. Thus, in the present example, suspended instruction pointer register 148 has stored therein jump destination address 460.
At step 340, the debug handler is executed and flow passes to step 350. In the present example, debug handler 420 is executed.
FIG. 5b shows a flow diagram illustrating the steps performed in step 340 by debug handler 420 according to one embodiment of the invention. FIG. 5b shows that flow passes from step 330 to step 530.
As shown in step 530, the count for each instruction executed is incremented and flow passes to step 535. In the example shown in FIG. 4, execution began at address 440 and a branch was not taken until jump source address 450. As a result, it is known that the instructions between address 440 and jump source address 450 were executed. Address 440 is available because it was stored by initialization routine 410 as the current starting address. Jump source address 450 is available because it was stored in jump source register 192. Debug handler 420 generates and maintains a data structure containing a count for each instruction in routine 430 which is executed. Debug handler 420 increments the corresponding count for each instruction identified by the addresses within the address range defined by address 440 and jump source address 450. In this manner, debug handler 420 maintains a record of the number of times each instruction is executed. The data structure maintained by debug handler 420 can be implemented in any number of ways, includes a linked list, an array, a hash table, etc.
As shown in step 535, it is determined whether to continue profiling. If it is determined to continue profiling, flow passes to step 540. Otherwise, flow passes to step 560. This determination can be made in any number of ways.
As shown in step 540, the jump destination is stored as the current starting address and flow passes to step 550. As previously described in relation to step 330, the jump destination address is stored in suspended instruction pointer register 148. Thus, in the present example, jump destination address 460 is stored in suspended instruction pointer register 148. Debug handler 420 copies jump destination address 460 from suspended instruction pointer register 148 and stores it in memory as the new current starting address.
As shown in step 550, the debug handler instructs the processor to resume execution of the suspended process. From step 550 flow passes to step 350.
Assuming it was determined to discontinue profiling in step 535, step 560 shows that the branch breakpoint event is disabled. In the described embodiment, this is accomplished by altering the state of enable bit 182 to indicate the disable state. From step 560 flow passes to step 570.
In this manner, profiling is performed using only branch breakpoint events. Thus, the execution of routine 430 is only interrupted for debugging purposes when an instruction is executed which causes a branch to be taken. Since jump instructions are typically only 10% of executed instructions, the overhead of handling these events for profiling is substantially reduced (approximately 10.times.) as compared to the prior art methods which utilize single stepping (As previously described, single stepping causes an event after the execution of every instruction).
To further improve the flexibility and performance of computer system 100 in relation to branch breakpoint events, FIG. 1 also shows computer system 100 includes a control unit 170 and a debug control register 180.
In one embodiment, processor 110 is operable in two modes; a kernel mode (also termed as the "system mode" or "privileged mode") and a user mode (also termed as the "application mode"). The system mode is used for executing operating system type code (e.g., events handlers), while the user mode is used for execution non-operating system type code (e.g., applications). Operating system code is software responsible for controlling the allocation and usage of hardware resources such as memory, processor time (e.g., multitasking), disk space, peripheral devices, etc. The operating system is the foundation on which application, such as word-processing and spreadsheet programs, are built. The kernel mode provides additional resources not available in the user mode. In one embodiment, for example, access to additional storage areas, execution of additional instructions (sometimes referred to as "privileged instructions"), and manipulation of critical components of the system (e.g., memory, input/output ports, etc.) is provided for only in the kernel mode. Thus, these additional resources are protected from use while the processor is in the user mode. In one embodiment, these additional resources include suspended instruction pointer register 148, status register 150, suspended status register 160, and debug control register 180. These modes of operation of processor 110 are also termed as "privilege levels." The selection between the different mode of processor 110 is performed by mode indication 156 stored in status register 150.
As previously described, in response to each event the processor suspends execution of the current process, stores the execution environment of the suspended process in suspend instruction pointer register 148 and suspended status register 160, and begins execution of the appropriate handler. Since the contents of status register 150 are copied into suspended status register 160 when the execution environment of the suspended process is stored, the state of enable bit 152 and mode indication 156 (mode indication 166 in suspended status register 160 corresponds to mode indication 156) used by the suspended process are preserved.
In addition to the above steps, execution unit 142 additionally performs the step of transmitting a signal to enable control unit 170 in response to each event. When enabled, control unit 170 loads status register 150 with handler status information. The bit of this handler status information which corresponds to enable bit 152 is acquired from an enable bit 182 stored in debug control register 180. Thus, the state of enable bit 152 is temporarily altered to the state of enable bit 182 during the execution of the different handlers. The programmer may store enable bit 182 in an enable state or a disable state, thereby causing branch breakpoint unit 190 to be enabled or disabled during the execution of the different handlers. In addition, control unit 170 causes the processor to switch to the kernel mode by storing mode indication 156 in the appropriate state.
Upon completion of each handler executed in response to an event, the execution environment of the previously suspended process is restored--i.e., the contents of suspended status register 160 are copied into status register 150. As a result, enable bit 152 is restored to its state prior to the event--i.e., the state used by the suspended process. In addition, the state of mode indication 156 is restored to its state prior to the event. Thus, if the suspended process was executing in the user mode, restoring the execution environment of the suspended process causes the processor to switch to operating in the user mode by altering the state of mode indication 156. The execution of the suspended process is then resumed.
In this manner, one indication is provided that allows the programmer to selectively enable branch breakpoint events during the execution of handlers (e.g., enable bit 182), and a separate indication is provided that allows the programmer to selectively enable branch breakpoint events during the execution of other software (e.g., applications). As a result, the programmer is allowed the flexibility of selectively enabling branch breakpoint events during the execution of either handlers, applications, or both.
Thus, an application programmer can improve performance during the debugging of applications by causing the operating system to alter the states of the enable bits such that branch breakpoint events are enabled during the execution of applications and disabled during the execution of handlers. For example, during profiling, branch breakpoint events need not be enabled during the execution of debug handler 430. Thus, initialization routine 410 is implemented to cause the processor to: 1) switch to the kernel mode; 2) store enable bit 162 in the enable state; 3) store enable bit 182 in the disable state; and 4) switch back to the user mode (See step 510 of FIG. 5a). By storing enable bit 162 in the enable state and causing the processor to switch back to the user mode, the state of enable bit 152 is selected for the user mode. Initialization program 410 then instructs processor 110 to execute routine 430 in the user mode. Since enable bit 152 is stored in the enable state, branch breakpoint events are recognized during the execution of routine 330 in the user mode. However, since enable bit 182 is stored in the disable state, branch breakpoint events are not recognized during the execution of handlers in the kernel mode (e.g., debug handler 420). In this manner, the performance of debugging applications is improved by avoiding the unnecessary recognition and servicing of debug events during the execution of handlers, such as the debug handler.
In a similar manner, a system programmer can improve performance during the debugging of handlers by causing the operating system to alter the states of the enable bits to cause branch breakpoint events to be enabled during the execution of handlers and disabled during the execution of applications. In this manner, the performance of debugging operating system routines is improved by avoiding the unnecessary recognition and servicing of debug events during the execution in the user mode.
Furthermore, either a system or applications programmer may desire to enable debug events during execution of all software. For example, the programmer would do this to debug problems related to the interaction between handlers and applications. This would be accomplished in a manner similar to that described above.
While this embodiment is described in relation a branch breakpoint event, storing a bit for identifying whether certain circuitry should be enabled during the servicing of an event could be implemented for any number of events and any number of different circuits. In addition, while this embodiment describes a computer system in which the enablement of the debug events depends on the current state of the enable bits in status register 150 and these enable bits are altered upon entering and exiting the kernel mode, alternative embodiments can use any number of techniques to provide separate indications for separately selecting the enablement of debug events in different modes. For example, an alternative embodiment can have one register in which all of the enable bits are stored and could have circuitry which chooses which bits in that register are currently used based on the current mode of the processor.
While the invention has been described in terms of several embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is not limited to the embodiments described. The method and apparatus of the invention can be practiced with modification and alteration within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. The description is thus to be regarded as illustrative instead of limiting on the invention.

What is claimed as being new and desired to be protected by Letters Patent of the United States is as follows:
1. A private parts cleaning system for allowing handicapped people and the elderly to clean hard to reach areas comprising, in combination:
a plurality of cleaning attachments adapted for cleaning hard to reach areas of a user, the cleaning attachments each being defined by a rigid plate, the rigid plate having an upper end and a lower end, the upper end having a cleaning head secured thereto, the lower end having an inverted Y-shaped protrusion secured thereto and extending downwardly therefrom;

6. The private parts cleaning system as set forth in claim 5 wherein the handle portion has a tapered upper end dimensioned for being received within the open lower end of the cylindrical collar of the attachment clip, the handle portion having a lower end formed with hand gripping indentations.
The present invention relates to a private parts cleaning system and more particularly pertains to allowing handicapped people and the elderly to clean hard to reach areas.
The use of sanitary cleaning devices is known in the prior art. More specifically, sanitary cleaning devices heretofore devised and utilized for the purpose of cleaning objects are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements.
By way of example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,019,447 to Sluz discloses a device capable of cleaning one's anus with a spray of water. U.S. Pat. No. 4,092,744 to Butoi discloses a washing device comprised of a water jet and brush capable of cleaning an individual's private parts.
While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objective and requirements, the aforementioned patents do not describe a private parts cleaning system for allowing handicapped people and the elderly to clean hard to reach areas.
In this respect, the private parts cleaning system according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in doing so provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of allowing handicapped people and the elderly to clean hard to reach areas.
Therefore, it can be appreciated that there exists a continuing need for a new and improved private parts cleaning system which can be used for allowing handicapped people and the elderly to clean hard to reach areas. In this regard, the present invention substantially fulfills this need.
In the view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of sanitary cleaning devices now present in the prior art, the present invention provides an improved private parts cleaning system. As such, the general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new and improved private parts cleaning system which has all the advantages of the prior art and none of the disadvantages.
To attain this, the present invention essentially comprises a plurality of cleaning attachments adapted for cleaning hard to reach areas of a user. The cleaning attachments each are defined by a rigid plate. The rigid plate has an upper end and a lower end. The upper end has a cleaning head secured thereto. The lower end has an inverted Y-shaped protrusion secured thereto and extending downwardly therefrom. An attachment clip is provided that is adapted for coupling with the plurality of cleaning attachments. The attachment clip includes an inverted Y-shaped channel dimensioned for slidably receiving the inverted Y-shaped protrusion of one of the cleaning attachments therein. The attachment clip includes a cylindrical collar extending downwardly therefrom. The cylindrical collar has an open lower end. A handle portion is provided that is adapted for removably coupling with the attachment clip. The handle portion has a tapered upper end dimensioned for being received within the open lower end of the cylindrical collar of the attachment clip. The handle portion has a lower end formed with hand gripping indentations.
There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are, of course, additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.

As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention. It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved private parts cleaning system which has all the advantages of the prior art sanitary cleaning devices and none of the disadvantages.
It is another object of the present invention to provide a new and improved private parts cleaning system which may be easily and efficiently manufactured and marketed.
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a new and improved private parts cleaning system which is of durable and reliable construction.
An even further object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved private parts cleaning system which is susceptible of a low cost of manufacture with regard to both materials and labor, and which accordingly is then susceptible of low prices of sale to the consuming public, thereby making such a private parts cleaning system economically available to the buying public.
Even still another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved private parts cleaning system for allowing handicapped people and the elderly to clean hard to reach areas.
Lastly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved private parts cleaning system including a plurality of cleaning attachments adapted for cleaning hard to reach areas of a user. The cleaning attachments each are defined by a rigid plate. The rigid plate has an upper end and a lower end. The upper end has a cleaning head secured thereto. The lower end has an inverted Y-shaped protrusion secured thereto and extending downwardly therefrom. An attachment clip is provided that is adapted for coupling with the plurality of cleaning attachments. The attachment clip includes an inverted Y-shaped channel dimensioned for slidably receiving the inverted Y-shaped protrusion of one of the cleaning attachments therein. A handle portion is provided that is adapted for removably coupling with the attachment clip.
These together with other objects of the invention, along with the various features of novelty which characterize the invention, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and the specific objects attained by its uses, reference should be had to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which there is illustrated preferred embodiments of the invention.
The invention will be better understood and objects other than those set forth above will become apparent when consideration is given to the following detailed description thereof. Such description makes reference to the annexed drawings wherein:
FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the preferred embodiment of the private parts cleaning system constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention.
With reference now to the drawings, and in particular, to FIGS. 1 through 3 thereof, the preferred embodiment of the s new and improved private parts cleaning system embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference number 10 will be described.
Specifically, it will be noted in the various Figures that the device relates to a private parts cleaning system for allowing handicapped people and the elderly to clean hard to reach areas. In its broadest context, the device consists of a plurality of cleaning attachments, an attachment clip, and a handle portion. Such components are individually configured and correlated with respect to each other so as to attain the desired objective.
The plurality of cleaning attachments are adapted for cleaning hard to reach areas of a user. The cleaning attachments each are defined by a rigid plate 12. The rigid plate 12 has an upper end and a lower end. The upper end has a cleaning head secured thereto. The cleaning heads preferably utilized are a washing sponge 14 (FIGS. 1 and 2) and a washing brush 16 (FIG. 3). The lower end has an inverted Y-shaped protrusion 18 secured thereto and extending downwardly therefrom.
The attachment clip 20 is adapted for coupling with the plurality of cleaning attachments. The attachment clip 20 includes an inverted Y-shaped channel 22 dimensioned for slidably receiving the inverted Y-shaped protrusion 18 of one of the cleaning attachments therein. The attachment clip 20 includes a cylindrical collar 24 extending downwardly therefrom. The cylindrical collar 24 has an open lower end 26.
The handle portion 28 is adapted for removably coupling with the attachment clip 20. The handle portion 28 has a tapered upper end 30 dimensioned for being received within the open lower end 26 of the cylindrical collar 24 of the attachment clip 20. The handle portion 28 has a lower end formed with hand gripping indentations 32. Alternately, the handle portion 28 could be telescopic to allow it's length to be adjusted to accommodate the specific need of the user.
In use, the user simply attaches the desired cleaning attachment to the attachment clip 20 and the handle portion 28 and maneuvers the handle portion 28 to effectively wash their private parts and other difficult to reach areas.
As to the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description. Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided.
With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and the manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.
Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.

Monday, October 28, 2013, 7-9PM, "Let's Try Democracy" with David Swanson (via Skype) from Charlottesville, VA. David, a prolific author, has a Masters Degree in philosophy from the University of Virginia. His newest book is "War NoMore: The Case for Abolition". In addition to being a writer, he's a journalist, activist, and educator, and hosts "Talk Radio Nation". David serves on the communications committee for Veterans for Peace, of which he is a non-veteran member. Copies of three of his books are available for purchase or to check out of the Many Ways of Peace library. In addition to "War No More: The Case for Abolition", "War is a Lie" and "When the World Outlawed War", the story of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, when 80 nations--including the United States--signed a pact renouncing war in 1926 in Paris. David is an outspoken critic of our govenrment's drone killing program.
For four Monday nights--January 28 through February 18, 2013--we came to Many Ways of Peace to learn about drones. You might have heard of the administration's "kill list". You've certainly heard about drones. But much about our government's deployment of drones remains shrouded in secrecy. What is not a secret, however, is the rapid rise of drones as the "weapon of choice" by the military and CIA following 9/11.
After Pat Chaffee's presentation (January 28) about her visit to Pakistan and what life is like for Pakistanis living under our drones 24/7, we began to have a sense that there is more to drones than we had anticipated. Pat is a sister in the Dominican order located in Racine. She went to Pakistan in October, 2012, with a Code Pink delegation to protest US drone strikes in that country. Here is a link to an important and revealing BBC special report,"The Secret Drone War", she showed us.
Ethan Cummings, moderator and facilitator for the entire KILLING BY REMOTE CONTROL: DRONE WARFARE series, conducted the second program, Drones 101: how they evolved into killing machines in remotely piloted war (February 4). Ethan's presentation was packed with information critical to a basic understanding the issues swirling around the use of drones primarily by the military, CIA, and the State department. Ethan's program primed us for the Senate Intelligence committee's hearing later that same week on the Obama administration's nomination of John Brennan to head the CIA. Brennan serves as Obama's counter-terrorism chief, with responsibility for the drone program. Here are links to the videos shown during the program::
The third program (February 11) featured a panel discussion on drones with area religious leaders. Seated from left, Fr. Dean Einerson, rector of St. Augustine's Episcopal church in Rhinelander; Dale Bishop, former pastor of First Congregational-UCC church in Rhinelander; and Jerry Woolpy, who is active in the Jewish Reform congregation in Wausau. Fr. Robert Koszarek, pastor of St. Peter the Fisherman Catholic parish in Eagle River, was unable to participate on the panel because of a family funeral. Following presentations by each of the panelists, the audience was invited to ask questions and make comments.
Our guests for the final program on February 18 were activists from No Drones Wisconsin and WI Coalition to Ground the Drones and Stop the
Bonnie Block is a longtime peace activist who explained she works to ground the drones because she thinks they are illegal, immoral, and ineffective. "I want a safer, more just, and peaceful world for my grandchildren to live in."
Joining Bonnie were Lars Prip of Janesville and David Soumis of Madison, who started the Drone Working Group within national Veterans for Peace. David also attended the International Drone Summit in Washington, DC, and runs No Drones Wisconsin. David says we need to stop the militarization of the United States, bring our troops home, and bring peace and harmony to all on the earth.
Went to Marina Bay Sands on Vesak Day which was a public holiday in Singapore. I took a train to the Promenade station and thereafter started walking to my destination. I did not realized that the journey took about 20 minutes – first walking to the Helix Bridge and then moving on along the pavement beside the main road. It was a hot day, and the sun was unforgiving. But I was rather disappointed while walking on the Helix Bridge, there was no relief from the hot weather. So the Helix Bridge is beautiful to look at but a disappointment in functionality – offering no relief against the sun and rain.
When I arrived at the Marina Bay Sands, the first thing that I saw was that there were lots of taxis queuing up for customers. So the surcharge imposed apparently was a success. There was very few people taking taxis from here and I noticed that many people choose either to walk or take a bus from/to Marina Bay Sands. My first impression of Marina Bay Sands Mall was that it was very spacious and I liked the high ceiling. As I continued to browse at the mall, I saw that there were many vacant shops. Apparently this mall was still very new and many tenants have yet to move in. In fact there are many ongoing renovation works going on at this new mall. The main attraction of this mall was the entrance to the casino. There were so many people queuing up at the entrance, consisting of tourists, foreign workers mainly from China and India and some local Singaporeans. I guess the casinos in Marina Bay Sands and Sentosa are currently the favorite hot spots for these foreign workers.
I spend about an hour in the Marina Bay Sands Mall before moving off. There was nothing much to see as the renovation works have yet to be completed. Perhaps I will come back to Marina Bay Sands again at the end of December this year. Food and drinks sold in this mall were rather expensive too. A normal plate of chicken rice costs S$5/-; whereas in most malls you can get the same plate of chicken rice for S$3.50. Is it a case of high rental rates or simply profiteering – I am not sure. But if you want to have an economical meal, you could simply head back to Suntec City or Marina Square where there are plenty of food outlets and fast food restaurants.

The Norwegian Forest Cat is native to Norway of course, with a very long history, that goes back hundreds, possibly thousands of years. This cat is a local favorite that appears in fairy tales and legends, one being that the Norse goddess Freya’s chariot is pulled by six giant cats.
Now where or how the cat originated remains a mystery. They may possible be the descendants of longhaired cats from Turkey, brought back from Byzantium by Scandinavian warriors who served the Byzantine Empire, or they may be related to the Siberian cat from Russia. They could have been Viking booty, or they could simply have been the result of natural selection: shorthaired cats whose adaptations to the harsh, near-Arctic climate produced descendants with woolly undercoats and long topcoats that shed water with ease.
For centuries, the skogcatt—a Norwegian word that translates as “forest cat”—survived by his wits or offered his services as a mouser to farmers and housewives in exchange for shelter in barns, stables or homes. In 1938, the cats were exhibited at a show in Oslo, but World War II interrupted any plans for developing them as a breed. Fortunately, they survived the war, just barely, but there were still some hard decades ahead and little was done with them until the 1970s. In 1977, they were finally registered as a breed with Europe’s Federation Internationale Feline. Two years later, a pair of NFCs was exported to the United States for the first time. The breed has since become popular in Europe and the U.S.

Dental implant is a small titanium construction, which is used to replace the root portion of a missing natural tooth. Over time it will “fuse” with the bone and serves as a support for fixation of crown, which fully replaces the lost tooth.
Yes, if you are missing one or more teeth. Your dentist will discuss your personal case with you. Thanks to dental implants you can smile with confidence, speak and eat without feeling any discomfort.
Aesthetics: The appearance of a person should not change with the loss of a tooth. Dental implant allows you to replace one or more missing teeth and is a reasonable alternative to conventional treatment. Thanks to dental implants you can improve your appearance, speech, chewing ability and to get pleasure from your favorite foods.
Preservation of natural teeth: The traditional approach of manufacturing and fixing dental bridgework requires processing and depulpation of two (sometimes more) of the contiguous teeth. This significantly reduces the “life” of these teeth. Dental implants allow you to avoid the necessity of preparation of healthy teeth.
Prevent jaw bone resorption: The timely reimbursement of missing teeth with implants prevents resorption (resorption, decrease in volume) of the jaw bone. The resorption develops due to the absence of the natural load on the bone that was previously created by teeth. This can lead to displacement and the subsequent loss of contiguous teeth and in the future it can lead to change of the shape of the face, as the jawbone shape the face. Preservation of jaw bone in the original volume will help to preserve the natural contours of your face.
Comfort: You won’t worry about presence of removable parts. The implant is stable and comfortable. After installation it does not require any adjustment. Usually it can serve throughout life.
The dental implant is placed into the jaw bone through a short operation under local anesthesia in office based conditions. It is followed by a period of healing and osseointegration with bone tissue of the jaw, this period may last from three (on lower jaw bone) to six (on upper jaw bone) months. Thus the reliable basis for long-term and stable fixation of the denture is formed.
If you have a bone deficiency, you will need bone grafting, which in turn will affect the duration of the implantation process. Your doctor will be able to determine exactly what needs to be done in your case.
As a rule, it is completely painless. Implantation is performed under local anesthesia (sometimes other forms of anesthesia can be used for).
After surgery you may feel not intense pain, but no longer than 72 hours. Analgesics, which are sold without prescription, will help to ease the pain.
The implant made from surgical titanium alloy, which is a biocompatible material. The cases, when the implant is not accustomed, are very rear. In these cases the implant is replaced by another.
The implant requires the same careful treatment as a natural tooth does. Clean it with a toothbrush, as well as natural teeth.
The service life of the implants depends on the health and physiological characteristics of the patient, the availability of harmful habits and proper care of the mouth cavity.

We get this question a lot: " How will receiving VA disability benefits affect my other federal benefits?" So, I decided to post an article that hopefully will be of assistance. This information is not exhaustive, but covers the majority of cases we encounter.
Here are the basics: Most federal agencies (as a matter of fact all that I know of), use Social Security rules and definitions for determining what is and what is not considered countable income. This is important because most federal programs are based on assisting low income individuals and are needs based. Essentially, when it comes to VA disability benefits, both Service Connected Compensation and Non-Service Connected Pension ("aid and attendance"), federal agencies regard the basic benefit rates (basic Compensation and basic Pension) as unearned, countable income according to Social Security definitions. The Special Monthly Compensation and Special Monthly Pension program of aid and attendance is considered unearned income due to it being characterized as reimbursement for medical expenses.
So. if an individual is receiving 60% Service Connected Compensation, that monthly Compensation is considered unearned income and must be counted for Medicaid, Section Eight HUD housing, etc. If an individual is receiving the maximum annual pension rate (MAPR) for, let's say, a veteran with no dependents and is also aid and attendance eligible, he or she would be receiving a monthly benefit of $1,758.00. Of that amount, $ 1,054.00 is considered basic Pension and the remainder, $704.00 is for aid and attendance. The $1,054.00 is unearned income; the $704.00 for aid and attendance is exempt income. You can call the VA at 1-800-827-1000 to request a breakdown of your benefits.
This rule is not clearly understood by local county or state agency personnel, so don't take their word, make them do a little research. The VA will be happy to provide a breakdown of benefits is asked for documenting what is and what is not considered unearned or countable income.
Medicaid: If a non-married benefit claimant becomes a resident in a facility that is Medicaid approved and they are eligible for Medicaid, their VA benefit is reduced to a stipend of $90.00. This stipend cannot be taken by the state. It is important to notify the VA if this happens in order to prevent an overpayment. A married beneficiary may continue to receive benefits but will have to count the basic Compensation or Pension rate as unearned income when applying for Medicaid. This additional income very often makes the individual ineligible for Medicaid benefits, unfortunately.
Military Retirement: Up until several years ago, it was not possible to receive the full amounts of military retirement and VA disability benefits simultaneously. If you were due VA disability benefits, you could choose to take the VA benefit in place of a corresponding amount of the military retirement. The advantage to the individual was that VA benefits are not taxable whereas military retirement was and is. However, Congress under pressure from veterans advocates changed this law and now allows full receipt of both benefits. Technically this is called "concurrent receipt." You can read the details by clicking here (38 C.F.R. 3.750).
Social Security. There are no issues with receiving Social Security and VA disability benefits simultaneously.
HUD Section Eight Housing: Again, the same basics apply. The basic rate for Compensation and Pension benefits is considered unearned income and must be counted. The additional special aid and attendance benefit is exempt. Again, ask the VA for a breakdown by calling them at 1-800-817-1000.

Debate on the European Union's proposed IT patenting legislation exposes divisions that will make it difficult for Members of European Parliament to make changes to the controversial proposal.
The European Parliament on Thursday held a major debate on the European Unions proposed IT patenting legislation, exposing divisions that will make it difficult for Members of European Parliament to make changes to the controversial proposal.
At stake is whether the EU will bring in more permissive rules on software patents, bringing it into line with patent practices in the United States and Japan. Currently, patents on pure software and business processes are not enforceable, making it impossible for large companies to bring their patent arsenals into play in the region.
The system is also seen as creating competitive advantages for the EUs open-source economy and for EU-based IT companies, which dont have to worry about the overhead associated with software patents.
The proposal, called the "directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions," faced strong opposition in its first round in the EP, called a first reading, and parliamentarians modified the text substantially to ensure software patents were locked out. The EU Council later threw out most of the EPs changes, and finally formally endorsed its version of the text in March, despite controversy over whether its text had sufficient support.
Campaigners against software patents now hope that the EP will be able to muster enough votes to push through its changes again, in the face of the higher voting requirements of a second reading. But Thursdays debate showed that the EPs legal affairs committee, JURI, is far from unified in its views.
Among those opposing any amendments was Irish MEP Brian Crowley, who argued that the current text simply keeps the status quo and that no new patents would be allowed under the directive. In any case, Crowley said, patents protect smaller businesses as much as larger ones.
Finnish MEP Piia-Noora Kauppi, on the other hand, argued that the Councils text is unacceptable as it is and criticized those who exaggerated the negative effects of the EPs original amendments. While the EP might have gone too far with a few of its first-reading amendments, changes must be made, Kauppi said. Recordings and transcripts of much of the debate has been made available online by the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure, the main European group coordinating opposition to software patents.
JURIs rapporteur, Michel Rocard, who is responsible for directing the second-reading process, is strongly in favor of altering the text to lock software patents out. In a working document published ahead of the debate, his comments echoed the anti-software patent arguments of figures in the open-source community, like Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds.
"Software is the combination of an original work of one or more algorithms, that is to say, a set of mathematical formulae. As Albert Einstein has said, a mathematical formula is not patentable. It is by nature an idea, like a book, a set of words, or a chord in music," he wrote.
FFII board member Jonas Maebe said it is difficult to judge from the debate which way JURI will swing when it votes on the issue in late June. "Quite probably it will be similar to the first reading, with the large groups all split," he said in an interview. "Which side will come out the stronger is anyones guess."
He said industry organizations such as EICTA, which supports the current version of the text, are aggressively lobbying MEPs not to make any changes. "There is really an incredible amount of lobbying going on, and most MEPs dont know who to believe anymore," Maebe said. "Everyone is claiming to represent SMEs [small and midsize enterprises], and everyone is saying that if their side fails it will kill innovation." He said the FFII wants the parliament to either pass amendments similar to those that came out of the first reading or to kill the directive.
In a second reading, it is more difficult for the parliament to make changes—they must be approved by an absolute majority of MEPs, regardless of abstentions or absences. A strict time limit is also in force.
If the EP makes amendments of the kind the FFII wants, the EU Council is likely to throw them out again. However, passing such amendments will give the EP more negotiating power in a later phase of the legislative process called conciliation.

Cagan Stadium in Stanford, Calif.The win was in sight for the Bears, who held a lead for over 51 minutes after junior forward John Fitzpatrick got a head on freshman Connor Hallisey cross in the 26th minute.Cal took the 1 0 scoreline into halftime, but Stanford struck back with a little less than 15 minutes left to tie it up.

Before she had come to the city, she had only a vague notion of what a factory was; dimly, she imagined it as a lively social gathering. “I thought it would be fun to work on the assembly line,” she said later. “I thought it would be a lot of people working together, busy, talking, and having fun. “This is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America.

In the meantime, Semmelweis continued to attempt to spread the word about his findings, but without the support of the Vienna medical community no one really considered him a serious researcher.

Consumers around the world would not hesitate to identify the brand behind the simple swoosh decorating some of the world’s most recognizable athletes. Nike’s branding, however, goes far beyond the logo everyone knows so well.

European Central Bank policy makers implicitly assume their newly-extended bond-buying programme will be tapered to a halt by the end of next year so long as the inflation outlook improves, according to officials with knowledge of the discussions.
(Bloomberg) European Central Bank policy makers implicitly assume their newly-extended bond-buying programme will be tapered to a halt by the end of next year so long as the inflation outlook improves, according to officials with knowledge of the discussions.
The Governing Council, which met on Thursday, focused on the first nine months of next year for its quantitative-easing program and didn’t formally debate options for what to do after that, said the people, asking not to be named because the talks are private. While tapering would be possible, extending the program without changing the pace of purchases is also a credible option if inflation doesn’t show sufficient progress, one of them said.
Policy makers agreed to cut monthly bond buying in half, to 30 billion euros, and President Mario Draghi said that a "large majority" backed the decision to include a pledge to extend again if needed. He added that "it’s never been our view that things should stop suddenly."
That decision came after governors were presented with several scenarios at a seminar on Wednesday, according to the people. Those included a reduction to 40 billion euros a month through June, and a 12-month tapering through December, similar to the Federal Reserve’s exit from its own program. The latter scenario wasn’t considered a realistic policy option, one of the people said.
Governors also looked at a three-month scenario that would see buying after September tapered in monthly steps to 20 billion euros, 10 billion euros and 5 billion euros, another official said.

This sermon is known as the sermon of ash-Shiqshiqiyyah, and is counted among the most famous sermons of Amir al-muminin.
Beware! By Allah the son of Abu Quhafah dressed himself with it (the caliphate) and he certainly knew that my position in relation to it was the same as the position of the axis in relation to the hand-mill.(But) I kept myself detached from it.
Then I found it wiser to endure calmly the blinding darkness of tribulations wherein the true believer acts under strain till he meets Allah (on his death). I watched the plundering of my inheritance until he died.
It is strange that during his lifetime he wished to be released from the caliphate but he confirmed it for the other one after his death. This one put the Caliphate in a tough enclosure where the utterance was haughty and the touch was rough. Mistakes were in plenty and so also the excuses therefore. Consequently, people got involved in recklessness, wickedness, unsteadiness and deviation. Nevertheless, I remained patient despite length of period and stiffness of trial.
When he went his way (of death) he put the matter (of Caliphate) in a group and regarded me to be one of them. Where was any doubt about me with regard to the first of them that I was now considered akin to these ones? The third man of these people stood up. With him his children of his grand-father, (Umayyah) also stood up swallowing up Allah’s wealth, till his actions finished him and his gluttony brought him down prostrate.
At that moment the crowd of people rushed to me. It advanced towards me from every side so much so that Hasan and Husain were getting crushed. When I took up the reins of government one party broke away and another turned disobedient while the rest began acting wrongfully as if they had not heard the word of Allah about the Hereafter.
But the world appeared glittering in their eyes and its embellishments seduced them. If people had not come to me and if there had been no pledge of Allah I then you would have seen that in my view this world of yours is no better than the sneezing of a goat.

KCs is a restaurant standing out amongst others: be it for its huge, impressive and colourful flow er-garden and the beautifully decorated house and diningroom, all of them placed in well looked after surroundings...
...Be it for its unique riverfront bar and lounges from where you can watch the daily elephant-bathing taking place right in front of you or enjoying a sundowner with awesome views over the Rapti river and across to the forests of Chitwan National Park...
...Or be it for the restaurant itself, that will surprise you with a big variety of delicious meals all freshly prepared in their modern open-built kitchen that allows you to watch the chefs with their skills at work while enjoying a romantic candle-light dinner being served by friendly and welcoming staff !
3 gardeners are taking care of the big impressive garden which was planned by the owner himself and was established 6 years ago, each year improving and growing more colourful flowers and bushes (at the moment, there aremore than 565 Dahlias in different colours flowering). All this is settled in front of the river Rapti, where along the riverside lounges invite you to spend the day watching canoes staking by, seeing the elephants bathing in the late morning or just enjoying the beautiful sights across to the grasslands and forests of Chitwan National Park... and beeing lucky, you will even get a sight of rhinos, who every now and then come grazing into the gardens at nighttime!
KCs restaurant is located in a traditional built two storey house covered with a stone and a grass thached roof, open towards the lovely gardens, with a nice river-breeze going through, cooling it from the heat of the day. There are nicely set tables under the roof and out in the garden place, where at night sometimes a logfire is burning. There is a bar in the restaurant itself and one at the riverside, with nice lounges to sit and watch ongoing life on Rapti river or enjoying a sundowner drink from the barkeeper with tempting names like "Tiger Special", "Sauraha Smile“ or "Rhino Horn“...!
The KCs restaurant is offering you a wide variety of nepali, indian, continental and mexican dishes, specialising in tender steaks, fresh fish and vegetarian food.

Our waiters are all well educated and get fresh training units every year to be the best in welcoming and serving you. The management under Mr. Naresh Giri comes out of a well-known family with great hospitality-experience.

Airbnb is being sued by the municipality of Paris for reportedly listing unauthorized houses for short-term renting on their website. A hearing has been scheduled for June 12 in a Paris court. The lawsuit, which also involves two other smaller firms, was brought against the companies for failing to take down listings of properties that lacked official registration numbers.
Airbnb is an online marketplace that allows homeowners to rent their properties directly to consumers for short-term stays.
A law passed by the French city last year limits the number of nights a homeowner can rent their property to 120 nights a year. In order to keep track of the number of nights a property has been rented, unique registration numbers were issued. Paris is suing the companies for failing to remove ads that lacked those unique identifiers.
The hotel industry has accused Airbnb of being an unfair competitor to their enterprise. Airbnb says that home-sharing rules in Paris are complex and put the needs of everyday Parisians “behind the financial interests of big hotel chains and well-funded lobby groups.”
The San-Francisco-based giant says it has tried to compromise with the city’s government. They point out that they proposed an automated 120-day limit for all Parisian listings, but that the city’s government refused it.
Deputy Mayor of Paris Ian Brossat said the city is seeking damages totaling 1,000-5,000 euros (roughly $1,200-$6,000) per day and per advertisement.
The move comes after a court in Singapore fined two Airbnb hosts nearly $46,000 each for violating that city’s short-term renting regulations.
Airbnb called the decision by the Parisian government “disappointing” and said it would primarily harm Parisian citizens, but said it would continue to work with city’s government on ways to best regulate their industry.
France is Airbnb’s second largest market after the U.S., with Paris being its single-biggest market with 65,000 homes listed.

Afterward, you may change your password, edit your Personal Information or request a password reminder at any time. Our database stores your billing and delivery information, and will automatically transfer it to the order form each time you place an order so that you do not have to re-enter this information when you sign in at subsequent visits.

Cookies: Like many other commercial sites, our Sites may utilize standard technologies called "cookies" and clear GIFs to collect information about how each of our Sites is used. A cookie is a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Cookies were designed to help a Web site recognize a user's browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot be read by a Web site other than the one that set the cookie. Cookies can securely store a customer's password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of selections, such as those selected in a "shopping cart." For instance, cookies allow us to pre-populate (or fill in) an email field with your email address if you revisit one of our Sites and place an order. When you place an order, we send a cookie to your hard drive to record the product name, category of product that you ordered, the amount paid, the order number and any referral codes.
No Personally Identifiable Information is recorded. When you click through to any one of our Sites from a promotional email, our Service Provider may send a cookie to your hard drive recording your IP address and other related information.
Clear GIFs: Some of our Service Providers may employ clear GIFs (also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs, web beacons or action tags) for our benefit to help us measure advertising effectiveness. Clear GIFs help us better manage content on our Sites by informing us of what content is effective. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of our users. The main difference between the two is that clear GIFs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear GIFs are not tied to your Personally Identifiable Information. Our Service Providers may use clear GIFs: (i) in HTML based emails to determine which emails have been opened by recipients; (ii) to record when products have been ordered from our Sites; and (iii) to track the visitor traffic on our Sites. These clear GIFs allow us to measure the usage of each of our Sites by our visitors and the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns. We may also use clear GIFs in a similar manner in our own emails and on our Sites.
Clear GIFs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited "www.companyX.com", which uses an advertising company's clear GIF, the Web site would match the clear GIFs identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information can be shared with the advertising company. We may provide such information to our Service Providers but that information can only be used by our Service Providers for our benefit.

Callie lost her parents when the Spore Wars wiped out everyone between the ages of twenty and sixty. She and her little brother, Tyler, go on the run, living as squatters with their friend Michael and fighting off renegades who would kill them for a cookie. Callie’s only hope is Prime Destinations, a disturbing place in Beverly Hills run by a mysterious figure known as the Old Man.
He hires teens to rent their bodies to Enders—seniors who want to be young again. Callie, desperate for the money that will keep her, Tyler, and Michael alive, agrees to be a donor. But the neurochip they place in Callie’s head malfunctions and she wakes up in the life of her renter, living in her mansion, driving her cars, and going out with a senator’s grandson. It feels almost like a fairy tale, until Callie discovers that her renter intends to do more than party—and that Prime Destinations’ plans are more evil than Callie could ever have imagined. . . .
I was given the ARC of STARTERS at the New York SCBWI Conference and I can’t tell you what a lucky break that was for me. I am so excited to have gotten an early peek at this debut novel. My only complaint? Now I have to wait, for what is going to seem like forever, until I can read ENDERS and find out what happens after all those cliff hangers? *growls at Lissa Price*
Why do I love this book? Starters has amazing characters, a very unique setting and a super exciting plot. But the best part is that all these wonderful components blend together seamlessly. I felt the very same way when I read CINDER by Marissa Meyer. These books have mastered the art of story telling–they are the complete package. STARTERS reeled me in from the very beginning and thoroughly captured my attention and emotions.
So, what’s special about STARTERS? A lot–but one of my favorite things is Price’s integration of the elderly into her novel. Below the surface of heart-thumping excitement, I found myself pondering some deep and interesting thoughts about Price’s society and how it relates to our own. I love a story that has layers and depth. And I know I mentioned it earlier, but the CLIFF HANGERS are amazing!!! STARTERS is a complete and fulfilling book and it’s teasers are not gratuitous–they are exciting and well thought out. Thank you!!!!
In my humble opinion, this book will be a well deserved success. And making it even sweeter, I love being able to support my fellow Apocalypsies and Lissa Price has just made my job so easy. Congrats, Lissa–I’m expecting great things from you and if you ever want to let me peek at ENDERS–I’m available.
The winner of this contest will also get some swag from me and it will include my new BOOKMARKS!!!! Want to see how pretty they are? They were created by the talented Jeff Allen Fielder and I loved working with him. I highly recommend him if you’re looking for someone to do your bookmarks. He’ll absolutely be making postcards for me too!!!
Here’s the front…with room for me to sign it if you’d like. How crazy is that??? Seriously, you’d be the very first person to have me sign anything. I’ll be blushing the whole time that I do it!
And here is the back with a sneak peek at my *heart squishing* blurb by the lovely and talented Daisy Whitney–the author of THE MOCKINGBIRDS and it’s sequel and new release THE RIVALS.
Yes, I get a little mushy every time I read it. *Pulls myself together* But the BIG question is…how can you win all this and maybe even a little piece of chocolate??? Leave a comment below with your contact information included and tell me and Lissa what your favorite kind of swag is? I’m starting to plan my swag bag and I’d like to invest in things that that are really useful and enjoyable to readers. Feel free to get creative. This contest will run from today (Monday, February 13th) until midnight EST on Friday February 17th. One winner will be picked at random. Good luck and PS…I give good chocolate.
I love bookmarks, postits and pens (I know thats dorky). Pretty much anything that I could bring to school with me and say to my students, “A real life author sent this!”. And they all go gaga!
My favorite is bookmarks – I really just love them. I also saw someone do little notepads once, and thought that was the coolest idea ever.
Kim! Your bookmark is BEAUTIFUL!!!! And I agree. Bookmarks are the best. We all read, right? And they’re perfect for framing . . . . 😉
Pens or pencils or notepads are good, too — anything that I can use on a daily basis, and just “happen” to use in front of other people who might ask, “What’s that?” so I can say, “That? Oh, nothing, really – just a novel written by one of my friends.”
Sometimes I also like to “forget” pens at a check-out counter (like at Barnes & Noble), where I know other people will find them.
That is a gorgeous bookmark!! For swag I love magnets or pins because I put them on my refrigerator! LOL
Your bookmarks are so pretty! Honestly, I think bookmarks are my favorite swag. I use them daily, and I like having lots of pretty ones I can share :0)
I’m even more excited to read STARTERS after reading your wonderful review! I can’t wait to get my hands on TOUCHING THE SURFACE later this year!
My favorite kind of swag, by far, has to be book cover posters (because pretty book covers totally deserve to be plastered on our walls), mugs featuring the title and cover art, and pens! Mugs and pens are an awesome idea, especially for those who work in an office. Extra buzz in the work place for fantastic upcoming titles 😉 I actually had a run in with a colleague who noticed my bright yellow “The Way We Fall by Megan Crewe” pen and wondered about the title. She actually ran out to buy it the same day when I pitched the storyline to her.
Hmmmm mugs in the office–I like that too! How cool is that, you sold a book with a swag pen. You guys have me all excited. And thank you so much for the bookmark love. (((hugs)))
Thank you very much for this opportunity. I’d love to read/win both books, of course! I know yours has been on my TBR pile since Michelle Wolfson recommended it to me on Twitter.
Bookmarks are useful. I like anything pertaining to writing: notepads, sticky notes, pencils, pens — those types of things :] Ooh. And magnets.
I can’t imagine how awesome it is for you to see your book coming to life! Congrats on your shiny new bookmarks 😀
I love bookmarks, pens, stickers, pins… basically everything I guess! It’s always fun to have something to gloat over other readers about. 🙂
Oooh, pretty bookmarks! 🙂 Hmmm…I love bookmarks, pins, stickers, postcards, and wristbands. But especially bookmarks, I collect them. :3
I look forward to the book, Starters, as much as yours and your beautifully designed bookmarks! I am not sure of what “swag” means, but I sure enjoy drawing. So i guess my swag would be artsy items, like wristbands, graphite pencils, colored pencils, drawing pads. I don’t know… All i know is that I am in a book club where there are 7 people from the 2,000 at school, and that we need some publicity. So i’ll be like, “Yeah, thas’ right, Kimbelry, a SUPER FAMOUS AUTHOR (emphasize), gave this to me. Haha.
Oh geez, I meant Kimberly. And oh- your book sounds so interesting!!!!! You should give out necklaces or ooh, posters that say like-this is my fourth life and it ain’t funny!!! That is not so funny the second time…..Or necklaces that say like, or have a picture of a clock.!!!! OOOhhhh i am having so many ideas right now!!
Okay Carla–sounds like you should be on my publicity committee LOL! Love your ideas and you called me SUPER FAMOUS AUTHOR which now makes me want to hug you. <3
These are all wonderful dmreas. I’m so glad for you that some are in the process of coming true. Your little girl reminds me of my daughter who was a dancer until her teens and my granddaughter who is one now. Such a joy to see their joy in action. :>)I know what you mean about the first one. That was a dream I let go of years ago. I held onto one by our near-by big lake, but I’m slowly moving toward a life just outside of town on an acre of land with a house that has a studio for me and a man cave for hubby and plenty of room for grandkids and animals. :>) We can get all that for half of what a lake house would cost us and it wouldn’t have all that I just mentioned, esp. the land part. So our dmreas sometimes have to bend to our reality, but that doesn’t mean our joy goes away. It’s just found in something different.
And your bookmarks are as pretty as promised. *glances covetously at the bookmark* As an adult addicted to YA, my favorite swag are pens and bookmarks because I get to have that “stealth” awesomeness, especially at work meetings or conferences.;-)
OMFG…I soo want the book, okkkeey breath breath and finger crossed for this one. BTW your review id amazing and the bookmarks, I’m getting greedy XD
OMFG….I so wanna read the book…breath breath, now finger crossed.BTW your review is just amazing..and the book marks?????super cool. I’m getting greedy XD
My favorite swag is bookmarks and pens. Love pens, something about a giant cup of pens I love them! So dorky, lol.
Bookmarks, stickers, and pins, like the ones that you pin to your shirt or something. I collect them and put them on my bag. :]
I love bookmarks! I’ve seen book-themed notepads, pens, and magnets, which is both cool and useful. I also love the mirrors made for Marissa Meyer’s book Cinder – they were such a neat idea! A little mirror you can carry in your purse or whatever, with an awesome book cover on the back. What’s not to love? :] Thanks for the giveaway!
Favorite swag? Of course, bookmarks! I’m a reader so while turning the pages looking at the bookmarks makes me so happy! That’s why I usually like my bookmarks creative and unique! But Starters looks awesome and so does Touching the Surface! Beautiful boomarks<3
I love bags and bookmarks. Somewhere i saw miniature book covers for your key chain. I think that would be great swag as well. I love the cover for Starters and the bookmark is beautiful(which I would love to have signed). Thanks so much for the review and the giveaway.
Hi! I love collecting swag. Seriously. I adore all of it. However, the swag I love to win and use would be super groovy bookmarks, bookcards, mini-bookmarks – all of those I actually use as, you guessed it. Bookmarks! I also really like the neat bracelets (rubber wristbands), note pads, and ink pens. Maybe stickers as well.
I have gotten the most response when I’ve done giveaways with the wristbands, note pads, pens and bookmarks. I hope some of these suggestions help!
I’m so looking forward for both Starters and Touching the Surface! And I love bookmarks, magnets and pins!
I like all kinds of swags – bookmarks of course, stickers (so I can stick them onto my uni books/notebooks and show off a bit). But little things, customized so that they connect with the book they’re supposed to represent are my favorite. Like small brooch, or necklace, or ring, or a customized letter? Just giving some ideas here, it all depends on the book!
I have been trying FOREVER to win this book!! If I don’t win, I will either cry or just buy the book when the time comes…. But winning would be nice too xD
Thanks for the opportunity to win! I’ve been excited about Starters for a few months now. Looks like I’ve got another book to add to my TBR list as well. My favorite swag is bookmarks and stickers.
STARTERS was a great read and thank you so much for taking an interest in TOUCHING THE SURFACE–I’m getting really excited about the book getting out there soon. I was a little nervous for awhile, but I’ve been doing a lot of soul searching and I think I’m ready for whatever comes my way. I wrote the best book I could and I’ve got to believe in that. <3
I’ve never received swag, but I have an odd obsession with pens. So that’d be really cool. That bookmark is so nice, Jeff Allen Fielder makes great bookmarks. And I am always looking for a new bookmark! Yeah…I’m not much help but I’m not sure exactly what people give away. I really want this book so thank you for the chance to win it!
I’m a pen girl myself. I get really attached to a good pen and then feel a bit lost when i run out of ink or break it LOL! Jeff is amazing and so easy to work with–a real gem! We need to get you some swag!!!! Maybe you’ll be the winner!
OH MY GOSH, I love the cover of Touching the Surface A LOT. I can’t wait to read the book. And starters sounds AMAZING! And for swags, I usually love signed bookmarks, signed bookplates, posters, postcards, even stationaries like pens or notepads. Thank you so much for the giveaway, Kimberly! I am definitely getting Touching the Surface when it’s out! 🙂
Celine-thanks so much for your kind words. I’m really proud and excited about TOUCHING THE SURFACE–It gives me shivers to hear someone else be excited to read it! <3
For swag, I love bookmarks! (yours are awesome, I love that there’s that empty space where you can sign them and it won’t cover anything else up! brilliant!) Also, stickers are fun and postcards. I also get intrigued if the swag is something unique that ties in with the book.
Oh gosh, the bookmarks are so lovely! I just want to caress them, haha. And Starters has got to be one of my most anticipated books of the year, if I’m being honest. It sounds like it has so much potential, I really can’t wait to get my hands on it. As for my favorite swag, I’m going to be very original now and say bookmarks since nobody else has. Haha, jokes. Stickers are fun, too. And pens. Oh, who am I kidding? All swag is good swag, baby! Now, about that chocolate…
I’m starting a blog soon but have no coding experience so I wanted to get advice from someone with experience.

Last year I bought a Passion Planner and optimistically blogged about it. You can read my 2015 Passion Planner post HERE. But now, it’s 2016 and I wanted to let you know how my planner worked out for me.
First of all, I had every intention of purchasing another one. I really love it a lot! But I became very excited at the end of the year, when I learned that there was going to be a mini passion planner on the scene in 2016.
The size of the planner was one of the main things I struggled with. I loved the space to write, but it took up way to much personal space on the counter near my computer. I tended to close it up and leave it behind my laptop, which kind of defeats the purpose of having the planner accessible.
With the compact planner, it’s just the right size to keep next to me and accessible. I will admit that unfortunately, the writing space often feels a little squished. But there’s nothing I’d like to sacrifice on the page to get more space, so I think I’m going to pull out a pen with a finer point and see if that helps. In fact–one of these might do the trick…
And using these pens in my planner will make me happy because I had to STOP using these pens in my planner. I know, you’re confused, but I can explain. I LOVED sitting down and color coding all of my weekly events with my fabulous new pens! I really did, but it took up too much time. Time I didn’t have to fart around with–even when I was enjoying it. On a good day, it was time I didn’t need to waste.
But as I was writing this post I joyously realized that I could rotate through my gorgeous fine tipped pens and mix up my colors seasonally or as the mood strikes me. Best of both worlds. *high five please*
I’m also consolidating some of my other calendars. In the past, I have a tendency to place a printed monthly calendar on the cabinet in front of me to track my writing progress. That calendar is ALWAYS changing. Some days I need to tightly track my word count. Other days I need to acknowledge that I’m revising but not track word count details. Some days it’s a mix of several things I’m working on. My needs and my accountability is fluid with the calendar.
I also keep a white board calendar in a different location, reminding me of my blogging days and author related activities. This calendar used to be above my desk (where I did my writing.) But once I moved to my new house, it didn’t quite play out like that. So, in 2016 (since this mini version) is right next to me) I’m keeping track of all of this stuff on the monthly pages of the planner. It’s a work in progress–I’m just starting to dabble with it, but I think I’m going to like this even better than what I was doing before. And then I’ll have a place to keep that info without papers being lost–because if you know me–you know I stash them in the oddest of places. You know, to keep them safe.
Overall I’ve found that the more accessible I keep the planner and the simpler I make my process, the more I use it. And the more I use it, the more I get out of it. So, despite some design incompatibilities (for me) and a lot of operator head space on my part–I’m still a HUGE fan of my Passion Planner and I’m always finding new ways to alter it to best suit my needs. I anticipate a January 2017 update coming your way next year.
Anyone else using a Passion Planner? Do you have another planner that works or doesn’t work for you? What are some of your best planner organizational tips? Do you LOVE colored pens as much as I do??? Tell the truth.
*On the cabinet on the left is the monthly calendars I post to keep track of my writing goals. They are at eye level, right in front of where I do a lot of my writing. They are a daily reminder to get my butt in the chair and hit my word count.
*In the middle of the room, on the fridge door, I’ve got an adhesive white board that tracks all the after school and school related activities of the boys. Each boy has a color and everyone can see who is staying after school, what they need to bring to school that day and what evening activities they have.
*On the far right I have a my 12 month calendar that has all the family events posted to include all birthdays and anniversaries. My husband makes no plans without checking this calendar. LOL!
*Back on the left side of the picture, is my computer/phone calendar which I can not live without because it has alarms!!! I need those pop up reminders on my computer and phone telling me where I’m supposed to be and what I should be doing. For example, I need an alarm to tell me that tomorrow I signed up to bring something to the bake sale, so now I need to go buy cookies and put them on a plate and make them look all Martha Stewarty.
*And right next to my computer, I have my newest planner, which is the main point of this post because I want to share it with you. It’s called my Passion Planner. I stumbled across it late in 2014 when a friend was ordering one. Here’s the skinny on the Passion Planner…
I am loving this planner because it’s a place where I’m sort of journaling and organizing together. I’m taking notes and making plans for the future, but also evaluating what I’ve just done. Really loving it and that’s why I wanted to share it with you.
It comes with directions and suggestions for use, but it feels so user friendly that I’m using what works for me and being really creative with it. It’s a work in progress, but what I really love about it is that I can see myself having one every year and over time these planners will function like a time capsule of my daily life and goals. Ya know, for the archives when I’m famous and stuff. *grin*
I’m also enjoying it because I don’t tend to journal on a regular basis. I use my blog to fulfill that aspect of my writing life, but this will fill in some of the gaps that aren’t possible on a blog. Things that I may not want to post publicly. Or things that aren’t so interesting to a blog readership. Yesterday, as I watched the live feed of the ALA Awards, I wrote down a list of all the new award winning books I wanted to read. Finally a list I won’t lose. *sigh*
Aren’t you loving this planner? If you’re interested in getting your own Passion Planner, you can find out more about it HERE.
Any of you calendar/planner addicts, too? What do you think is the appeal? Could it be the colored markers or the stickers? Or is it because so much of the rest of my life is completely unorganized?

I’m so stinking excited. I’ve been asked to be the recipient of the Alice Curtis Desmond Award, given by the Desmond-Fish Library at their Annual Associates Awards Dinner. I’ll be receiving the award on May 6th along with two other award winners. And yes, I am intimidated and blown away by the amazing company I get to keep…
I’ll be participating in one of the panel discussions and signing books that day. Here is the current list of the authors attending and the panel and presentation schedule will be posted shortly.
It’s that time of year again! #ny18scbwi This weekend was the NY SCBWI Winter Conference. This year the SCBWI changed things up a little bit. Based on the feedback they’ve been receiving from it’s members, they wanted to try to create a conference that had a more intimate feel. The goal was to provide us […]
A blog about teaching English in South Korea, living in Korea, and various assorted thoughts + short film interests
A lot of other people also visited there (Gangwondo province, Gangneung city), as this is the end of summer vacation time and a 3-day weekend. Additionally, it is hot, and there are some nice beaches in the area.
We had a big raw fish meal at the beach (we were three people, but there was easily enough food for five):
At this village in the country outside of Gangneung, there are no stores, schools, or any commercial establishments. Only small farming houses. No children. Yet you can see the stars at night, and for the first time I saw a marten ( a weasel-like animal) when it crossed the road in front of our car . . .
Anmok beach is the place where locals go (plus a lot of tourists) . . . tons of coffee shops, raw fish restaurants, some grilled shellfish places (my favorite), and more, all in a short stretch (maybe 1 km) along the beach.

BuzzFeed – The popular news and entertainment website earns revenue by selling advertisements on their site, so the key objective of their marketing team is to drive more traffic. With that in mind, BuzzFeed sends regular email newsletters containing links to stories on their website with the goal of increasing the number of visits they get each month and increasing the amount of revenue they generate.
Use it to make sales on autopilot. Creating a sales funnel out of an email autoresponder sequence is a widely adopted strategy used by information marketers, but it can also be used by software companies, eCommerce businesses and service providers. For example, it could consist of a series of educational videos, a sales video and follow-ups to sell your information products. Or, you could create a sequence of free educational emails, and then invite them to a live or recorded webinar where you make an offer. For eCommerce businesses, your sales sequence could include promo offers for products your subscriber has just viewed on your website.
4. Make Links Clear and Visible & Use Text Links: Make sure that all links to your product purchasing pages are clear and visible. When possible, default to blue, underlined links for easy user recognition. Though in web design it is often unadvisable to use the words "click here" in a link, in email design it typically is more effective to use the words "click here." Make sure that your links are text links and not image-based links as images may not appear in all emails.
Well, charity: water took an alternate route. Once someone donates to a charity: water project, her money takes a long journey. Most charities don't tell you about that journey at all -- charity: water uses automated emails to show donors how their money is making an impact over time. With the project timeline and accompanying table, you don't even really need to read the email -- you know immediately where you are in the whole process so you can move onto other things in your inbox.
Email marketing has always been Permission based, but is silently replaced with its brother; Tease Marketing, continuously building on a brand relationship based on mutual interest. The challenge becomes presenting an – already in itself – appealing and attractive message. But how to benchmark your email marketing efforts to fit that new train of thought?
Lead management is a combination of several things. First you need the right tool to store your leads. There’s no point generating a torrent of leads if you can’t view them all, with context, in one place. And then you need to nurture every lead before they can be convinced about doing business with you. Finally, you’ve got to be able to rank your leads—based on how much (or how little) they engage with your business—so you can reach out to the hottest leads first.
How do you minimize unsubscribe requests and spam complaints for your auto-responder program? The best way to minimize the risk of unsubscribe requests, spam complaints and non-opened emails with your auto responder program is the same way to minimize those risks with all email marketing. Provide useful, engaging content and good offers that your subscribers will care about. You can also use the best practices for managing unsubscribe requests, opt outs and spam complaints that we'll discuss later in this book and which include: prominent and easy-to-find placement of the unsubscribe link, proper opt-out and opt-in messages and asking users to "white list" you in your initial email.
CTR is the number of clicks on your CTA button, versus the total visitors to that landing page or ad. If 1000 people visit your landing page/view your ad, and 650 people click on the CTA, your CTR is 65%. A high CTR depends on a number of factors, chief among which are the value proposition on your page/ad, your CTA’s placement, and the relevance of your content vis-à-vis your target audience.
If there is something I have noticed about B2B leads is that you have to cast as wide a net as possible. You have so many avenues and options that just managing the funnel can be a challenging task. Every companies website should be the corner stone of their digital campaigns. Every visitor here should be considered a potential customer and Lucep uses instant response and artificial intelligence to make sure your sales team catch every opportunity that comes to your page.
Email marketing is all about expectations, and it’s up to you to set them. If your call to action is strong, and your follow-up is consistent, then you can count on a positive campaign. However, if you promise to send one email per week and instead send them daily, then you’re setting yourself up for failure. On the contrary, if someone is expecting daily updates or critical product updates and you don’t’ deliver, then they are likely to be just as upset in that case too.

Marketing works with Sales to establish key criteria for lead segmentation and scoring. Hopefully, you have already created a comprehensive list of buyer personas and a detailed buyer journey for each persona. If not, check out these resources. Now plan how you will capture this information through landing pages and forms, using a progressive profiling approach so that conversion rates are kept high. Identify relevant pages and events that, if visited or triggered, also allow you to update lead profiles during the buyer journey. Access LinkedIn, Data.com, Hoovers and other business data sites you can use to cross-reference leads and further develop their profiles. Some of these sources can be directly integrated through HubSpot and Salesforce apps and APIs.
Whether you’re dealing with consumer or business leads, successful lead scoring depends on a number of factors, such as high-quality content, well-defined buyer personas, relevant interactions, and involvement of the sales team. Lead generation software can be a useful tool, as often includes automated lead scoring. Learn more about how to generate leads on the blog. https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1463308986image05-1024x694.jpg
Let’s begin by with the definition of a lead. What does a lead mean to your company? Many companies have different definitions depending on their sales cycle, but standard definition is a qualified potential buyer who shows some level of interest in purchasing your product or solution. For the leads that fill out a form, they often do so in exchange for some relevant content or a compelling offer.
Lead generation is the use of a computer program, a database, the Internet, or a specialized service to obtain or receive information for the purpose of expanding the scope of a business, increasing sales revenues, looking for a job or for new clients or conducting specialized research. Leads can consist of the names and addresses (or e-mail addresses) of individuals, corporations, institutions or agencies. Lists of leads can be gathered or filtered from targeted databases such as telephone and Internet directories.
Attention scarcity is driving a shift from “rented attention” to “owned attention”. Historically, most marketing has been about renting attention other people have built. An example of this would be if you purchased an ad in a magazine or rented a tradeshow booth. But in the noisy, crowded market that today’s buyers live in, rented attention becomes less effective as attention becomes even scarcer. Of course, this is not an either-or proposition; you will ideally use a mix of rented vs. owned attention for your lead generation efforts to be affective.
When people talk about email marketing, lots of them forget to mention transactional emails. These are the automated emails you get in your inbox after taking a certain action on a website. This could be anything from filling out a form, to purchasing a product, to updating you on the progress of your order. Often, these are plain text emails that marketers set and forget.
"The number of Cyberchondriacs has jumped to 175 million from 154 million last year, possibly as a result of the health care reform debate. Furthermore, frequency of usage has also increased. Fully 32% of all adults who are online say they look for health information "often," compared to 22% last year." said Harris Interactive in a study completed and reported in August 2010 with demographics based in the United States of America.[5]
Lead generation often uses digital channels, and has been undergoing substantial changes in recent years from the rise of new online and social techniques. In particular, the abundance of information readily available online has led to the rise of the “self-directed buyer” and the emergence of new techniques to develop and qualify potential leads before passing them to sales. https://www.sageworld.com/img/dist-emailcampaigns-top.png
Over time, the popularity of email marketing campaigns resulted in personal email inboxes that were overflowing with the latest and greatest offers. Email campaigns grew and people grew tired of them. Laws that allowed customers to unsubscribe breathed new life into email marketing campaigns as customers could easily pick and choose the companies they were interested in.
ConvertKit is specifically designed with creative people in mind, and that’s why we’ve chosen it as our email marketing software here at Copyblogger. Any member of our editorial team — no matter how technically challenged — can easily perform any task that needs to be done, including sending messages, creating automated sequences, using tags for message segmentation, reviewing analytics, and identifying personalization opportunities.
In B2B, inbound is the preferred channel of lead generation. The whole process of drawing a lead into doing business with you—by educating first and selling later—matches the B2B business model, where businesses don’t make impulsive purchase decisions. Which is why inbound marketing in B2B takes leads through three levels of the sales funnel: ToFu (top of the funnel), MoFu (middle of the funnel), and Bofu (bottom of the funnel).
The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, widely known as "ACMA". The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages, states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages, and gives other key information. Fines range with 3 fines of AU$110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines (2011), Tiger Airways Holdings Limited (2012) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited (2013).[13]
Rather than simply handing over a list of leads from one team to the other, they work together to define which leads are ideal and nurture relationships with those leads throughout the sales cycle. The marketing team can consider specific demographic information and behaviours to qualify and score leads to ensure that they are ready to be passed on to sales.
3. Email converts better. People who buy products marketed through email spend 138% more than those who do not receive email offers. In fact, email marketing has an ROI of 3800%. That’s huge! And if you are wondering if social media converts even better, think again: the average order value of an email is at least three times higher than that of social media.
Beyond incentives, often a key part of the conversion funnel that can be optimized is the lead form. Although it is beneficial from a business standpoint to collect as much information as possible about a prospect, more forms fields leads to a reduction in form submissions. Experiment with different form lengths to see what is optimal in terms of lead capture and lead information. https://royalexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/email-campaign.jpg
One of the more current developments on the email marketing front is the use of auto responders, or automated emails, that happen in a set sequence after a user's email address is captured. Typically the end goal of an auto responder email series is converting that user to a purchaser or customer. In this section, we'll introduce you to what an auto responder is, how to use them, the pros and cons, and some basic best practices for auto responder. Auto responders offer unique benefits in that they can produce results with a limited amount of effort on your part after the initial build out of the program. However, auto responders also present some challenges and best practices that should be considered when determining the role of an auto responder in your email marketing mix.
Whether you’re dealing with consumer or business leads, successful lead scoring depends on a number of factors, such as high-quality content, well-defined buyer personas, relevant interactions, and involvement of the sales team. Lead generation software can be a useful tool, as often includes automated lead scoring. Learn more about how to generate leads on the blog.
This vast quantity of information also means that customers are no longer as interested in listening to a traditional sales pitch that doesn’t relate directly to their needs and it might even push them away. It is now important for companies to focus on generating new leads by developing a strong internet presence. This is often accomplished using inbound marketing methods that employ techniques like search engine optimisation and content marketing.
Lead generation used to involve purchasing lists of names and sales representatives cold calling people at home, but modern advances in technology have made it possible for us to now generate leads based on specific criteria and information. Companies collect information about potential buyers and then tailor marketing methods and sales pitches to the prospects’ needs.
Twitter has Twitter Lead Gen Cards, which let you generate leads directly within a tweet without having to leave the site. A user's name, email address, and Twitter username are automatically pulled into the card, and all they have to do is click "Submit" to become a lead. (Hint for HubSpot users: You can connect Twitter Lead Gen Cards to your HubSpot Forms. Learn how to do that here).
One thing that hasn’t changed with email marketing is that you need to be strategic about how you word every part of marketing emails. One of the best things about email subscriptions of today is that you can count on your prospects having some level of interest in your product or service that encouraged them to sign up for your subscription list to begin with.
First, act as though you’re a prospect making their way to your business’s landing page. Start by ensuring that the links to your landing page are working, wherever they may be — email, PPC networks, sponsored social media posts, etc. Are they driving you to the landing page that they’re supposed to? Does everything look the way you intended on every browser? https://reallygoodemails.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Have-You-Seen-Our-Top-100-Email-Marketing-Campaigns.png
Kim de Groot is a design researcher with an MA in new media. She is part of the lectoraat Communication in a digital age and teaches new media at the Willem de Kooning academy Kim's research deals with the inverted relation between image and reality. Moving from representation to the performative, from the visual to the infrastructural, images are no longer created to represent a reality but to manage it. Kim examines images as informational objects and traces the relations between image, event and media.

You know how hard Federal contracting is. You’ve had those weeks, those months: no signs of life anywhere. You turn over the rocks, you dig. Everything seems absolutely uninhabited. Nobody’s returning calls. No opportunities. Nothing.
And yet. You know that Federal agency is spending money. In fact, your competitor is winning some of it, and it’s really annoying the socks off you. What signs of life did they see that you missed?
Finding signs of life in a hostile, barren environment isn’t for everybody. Up for the challenge? You’ll need to look closely, analyze small clues, notice patterns that your experience suggests might mean there are opportunities nearby. It can be done…but finding what you’re looking for in a difficult environment takes expert help.
A friend of mine, Dr. Jay Glass at NASA’s Ames Research Center, is leading a field team to test the prototype of a remotely-operated rover in one of the hottest, driest, places on earth…which is to say, conditions as close as one might find on Mars* without making the trip. They want the rover to be able to collect and analyze samples on Mars and send data about those samples back to Earth, so we can understand more about what kind of life there may be, or may have been, on Mars.
The last week of February and the first week of March, I’ll meet roboticists, exobiologists, technologists, geologists, engineers, and other really smart folks who are doing things that are just about out of this world.
I’ll be sharing lessons from my field trip on what it’s like to be on the front lines with this Federal agency — its staff and contractors — while they literally push the bounds of science, technology, and exploration.
But I won’t be leaving you behind. In fact, I’ll be thinking about what lessons we can learn as Federal contractors as I watch how the NASA team depends on the specialists they engage to support the mission.
Follow me! I love photography as well as adventure…so “LIKE” my Summit Insight Facebook page(link is external) to get pix and updates while I’m with the NASA field camp in Chile!
P.S. As for Federal contracting, lots of people would rather take their chances in the hyper-competitive jungle than spelunk around Federal agencies that seem “dead”. After all, the jungle may be lush, wild, and dangerous, but at least stuff is growing like crazy. You just have to make sure it doesn’t kill you first (a different problem, to be sure).
Desert or jungle? What’s your pleasure? Either way, I’m happy to find you the experts you need to navigate to your success.

MONTREAL — Protesters forced the cancellation on Monday of the first day of hearings in Montreal into TransCanada’s Energy East Pipeline project with police making three arrests.
And the National Energy Board said in a statement that it was also postponing Tuesday’s session because of the “violent disruption” that it said “threatened the security of everyone involved in the panel session.”
On Monday, one man charged at the three NEB commissioners seated at the front of the room minutes before the hearings were set to begin. He was grabbed by security officers, allowing the commissioners some time to leave.
“TransCanada will not pass,” he screamed as police dragged him away from the downtown conference room.
A 44-year-old man and 29-year-old woman were charged with obstruction and released, while a 35-year-old man was charged with obstruction and assaulting a police officer and remained detained as of Monday afternoon.
Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre, along with the mayor of nearby Laval and other municipal representatives, walked out of the hearings not long after the demonstrators charged in.
Coderre was the first person scheduled to give testimony Monday but chose instead to leave, calling the protests a “masquerade.”
He and many provincial politicians and First Nations groups oppose TransCanada’s project to transport crude oil from Alberta to New Brunswick.
“There are too many problems we are witnessing to accept the project,” Coderre told reporters after he decided to leave the hearings.
“We’re saying the project (TransCanada) presented is wrong, it’s bad and we don’t have the answers. And frankly one of the main issues is contingency plans, everything regarding safety.”
Coderre asked last week for the hearings to be suspended after media reports revealed that two of the three NEB commissioners overseeing the review process met former Quebec premier Jean Charest, who was at the time a lobbyist for TransCanada (TSX:TRP).
Nonetheless, Coderre said it was important for him to give testimony in order for the NEB and the rest of the country to appreciate the concerns of local citizens.
Federal Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said the review process is designed to hear from Canadians.
“Whatever their point of view might be, we think they should all have a right to say it,” Carr said in Edmonton. “And if there were circumstances that didn’t allow people to speak on a very important national subject, I’m sorry about that.”
Monday was not the first time protesters sought to disrupt environmental hearings into the pipeline project. In March, protesters began chanting as soon as Louis Bergeron, Energy East’s vice-president for New Brunswick and Quebec, began speaking.
Monday’s protests were not exclusively anti-pipeline. Members of a large construction union holding signs in support of Energy East outnumbered anti-oil activists outside the conference centre.
“I’m convinced that moving oil by pipeline is more safe than transporting it by train or tanker,” said union member Sylvain Morissette. “In Quebec, we had bad experiences with oil transport by rail.”
One of the anti-pipeline protesters, Kristian Gareau, said the entire NEB process is illegitimate because two of the commissioners had met with Charest.
“There is a perception of bias,” said Gareau, 36. “These two commissioners are part of this democratic institution, which has the sweeping power of a federal court.
“So a judge cannot go and meet with people in a backroom. It just shows this smug elite privilege which is completely unacceptable.”

Of the 35 titles, none include a character name. Meet-An-Inmate connects people like you with inmates from across the United States, and offers an easy way to brighten up an inmates day.
One example is below in which the female circled in yellow is also located on an amateur adult site called Xxxonxxx. To use this service, you must be at least 18 years of age.
This is not to say that modern titles cannot use character names, just that you probably have better alternatives for modern audiences. I would interpret this as fairly strong evidence that the most effective titles which correlates with but is not identical to which books sold the most, I feel generally do not have names.
However, you can increase the response rate to your messages and the percentage of girls who message you first by using the methods below. You may search in the usual ways, but the site also offers a search by personality type.
Inmates who establish and maintain positive relationships with people outside of prison are less likely to return to prison in the future, also improving the inmates chances of successfully reintegrating into society when released. Using these examples as guidelines, any man should be able to come up with a brief synapses that attractively portrays who he is.
If your target audience is older than 13, this could be fatal. Although Meet-An-Inmate is an online service, prisoners do not have access to the internet. She was a mute. It will serve up potential matches by your clicks, not just your criteria.

Mumbai: Bollywood's most glamorous star couple Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh, after 6 years of dating, are finally set to get married on November 14-15. It's been reported that the couple will tie the knot at Lake Como in Italy for the wedding.
The wedding rituals have already commenced as Deepika recently attended an auspicious puja in Bangalore while Ranveer was snapped during his haldi ceremony on Sunday. Reportedly, Ranveer’s family will wear colour co-ordinated outfits and Deepika’s side of the family will wear Sabyasachi outfits.
Now according to PinkVilla report, the 'Bajirao Mastani' couple is on a hunt for their dream house in Mumbai albeit a temporary one before they could move into their dream home after couple of years.

“Zeroing down on such an apartment isn’t easy and this will take some time. They don’t want to rush into choosing a property and they also want to do it up completely before they move in," a source told entertainment website.
The report also stated that Ranveer doesn’t want to displace Deepika from her existing residence in Prabhadevi till their new address isn’t fully ready. Therefore, the couple would be moving into this new house till the time they build their new home together.
Meanwhile, post returning from their grand wedding, the couple will be hosting two receptions for industry folks and other closed friends - one in Bengaluru and Mumbai.
On the work front, the duo is currently busy in their respective film shootings. Ranveer will next be seen in Rohit Shetty’s Simmba starring Sara Ali Khan while Deepika has given her approval for the role of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal in her biopic, directed by Meghna Gulzar

Many of my best food memories from childhood occurred at chain restaurants. It’s an old story by now–how my parents didn’t cook, yadda yadda yadda–and we ate most of our weeknight meals in Boca Raton at restaurants owned by athletes (Pete Rose’s, Wilt Chamberlain’s) or country-wide chains like Chili’s, Friday’s and The Cheesecake Factory. At the top of the chain restaurant hierarchy was a restaurant that’s still in business around the country, and still just as good as it was the first time we ate there; that would be Houston’s.
Lena Dunham attended the 4th annual L.A. Loves Alex’s Lemonade event on Saturday in a bright yellow shift dress from the Rebecca Minkoff Fall 2013 collection.
This look left me speechless and not in a good way. The shape of the dress is extremely unflattering and it's not much better from the back. The clunky black heels are also a horrible choice as they do not compliment the dress at all. This makes me sad because I've seen her look way better (she looked totally fab in her Marie Claire spread!).

While Plymouth was fully ensconced in the Classic Muscle Car Era and the 1960s Horsepower Wars, it was mostly with an assortment of compact and midsized cars with huge engines stuffed in. Classic muscle car-tech. It's what Chevy did with the Chevelle SS and how Pontiac turned the lowly Tempest into arguably the world's first muscle car, the GTO. Plymouth had done great business turning the compact Valiant into the first Barracuda, and the midsized Belvedere into the Road Runner and GTX. Plymouth occupied the lower-price-tier in the muscle car market, and did very well for themselves. But, the one thing they were lacking was a bona fide Pony Car, to compete with Mustang and Camaro. The early Barracudas were crude attempts at this, very crude, and not nearly what was needed to tap into this huge new market. It took until 1970 for Dodge and Plymouth to launch their first true Pony Cars, the Dodge Challenger and Plymouth Barracuda. Just in time to hit the peak of the muscle car era in 1970 and to follow it's decline from then on. Most enthusiasts and collectors consider these Mopar twins to be the best Pony Cars to come out of this era. Unfortunately, they just arrived to late to make nearly the impact that they could have, and should have.
The 1970 Plymouth Cuda shared it's E-body platform with the Dodge Challenger, although it rode on a 2-inch shorter wheelbase than the Challenger. Interestingly, even though the Challenger had the longer wheelbase, it was 3-inches shorter than the Cuda. While viewed separately, they appear to be similar, they two sister-cars didn't share a single body panel, and when viewed side-by-side, many differences emerge. Designed by John Herlitz, the new look abandoned the old fastback design in favor of a sporty hardtop with a long hood and short rear deck. It was also available as a convertible. The E-body was actually a modified B-body that had been shortened and widened. Otherwise, it shared all the common hardware out of Chrysler's parts bin. And the new E-body cars were designed from the start to accept every engine Chrysler built, right up to the massive 426 Hemi.

At a time when it’s popular to be critical of our country, Madison’ Rising is taking a very different approach – including the Star Spangled Banner on their current album along with other patriotic songs with a hard rock twist. It’s certainly not the traditional sound but it’s sure to resonate with a younger, patriotic audience. The Star Spangled Banner single has now sold one million copies. Who said patriotism was dead.
According to their website, “Madison Rising brings great rock music back to the forefront of popular culture. With songs ranging from the guitar heavy opening track “Right To Bear,” to the hauntingly epic sounds of “Honk If You Want Peace,” to the beautiful violins of “Hallowed Ground,” it is clear that this band is on a mission to not only make great music, but also send a message that American culture is alive and well.” http://www.madisonrising.com/
With an original goal to sell 1 million copies of the Star Spangled Banner they’re onto their goal of 5 Million. Let’s help them out.. Rock on America!!!
In a world filled with expectations around beauty, size and weight it’s easy to get down on yourself. Let’s face it, the world can be mean… even cruel. Meet Lizzie Valesquez who the “internet” dubbed the “Ugliest Woman” while she was still in highschool. If highschool wasn’t tough enough, try living with that moniker.
During a mean-spirited eight second video posted on Youtube, the darker side of human beings came out. If the video itself wasn’t bad enough. The comments that followed were devastating. Viewers called her everything, including a monster. One, went so far as to encourage her to “Kill Herserlf.” These comments would be hard to read at any age, but in highschool they could have been devastating.
Life has been difficult for Lizzie who was born premature with an undiagnosed disease. Her mother relates stories of purchasing doll clothes for her daughter, who was too small for regular clothing. Along with only two other people, Lizzie is unable to maintain any type of body fat. In addition to looking different, this presents difficulty when the body attempts to store nutrients which normally reside in fatty tissue. The disease requires that she must eat every fifteeen minutes just to have enough energy to get through the day, a day that can be filled with cruel comments.
According to her website (www.aboutlizzie.com), “In a time when many people change their appearance in order to feel accepted, she has accepted herself with extraordinarily positive self-esteem. Her attitude, not her syndrome, is contagious.”
While Lizzie admits the mean comments still hurt, she refuses to be defeated. Today she is a successful motivational speaker and twice published author who shares a positive message. “Her second (book), shares her advice on being unique, how to make and keep good friends, dealing with bullying and negativity, the art of personal meditation, talking to God in your own words, and setting realistic goals.”
Hospice and hospice caregivers in Kirkersville, Ohio work closely in collaboration with the compassionate staff at Hoskinson Funeral and Cremation Service in order to provide a continuum of care bridging the gap between the time of death and bereavement. For this reason Hoskinson Funeral and Cremation Service has become an integral part of hospice care. The Remembrance Planner professionals at Hoskinson Funeral and Cremation Service appreciate the trust that families and hospice caregivers place in them and they constantly strive to be deserving of that trust. At no time will family members be without support. The strong attachments and trust developed in one supportive environment (hospice) are shared and transferred to another (the funeral home) as the family moves through the process of dying, death and bereavement.
With greater understanding of each other’s care, areas of expertise and resources, the hospice care team and funeral home collaboration allows them both to plan a course which makes for a more natural transition of care at the time of death and in caring for the survivors in the months following the death.
When you consider the philosophy of hospice and funeral service, it is clear why the continuum of care provided by the professional staff of Hoskinson Funeral and Cremation Service is a "natural extension" of hospice care in Kirkersville, Ohio.

Eco-Friendly, Best Health Food Store, Mana Foods, Maui Businesses, Maui Hawaii, zero waste efforts, produce department
At Mana Foods we believe in zero waste efforts. Maui is small, and we work to do everything we can to take care of our beautiful island home. The following is a bit from behind the scenes of our produce department. We thought this may be interesting and inspiring to our valued customers. Thanks for the continued support, and thanks for taking the time to read about some of our environmentally friendly efforts.
First, we break the boxes down and then reuse them. Any boxes that we do not reuse at Mana we make sure to return to local farmers who we get our produce from. This way the farmers can repurpose them on their farm, which in turn helps to keep the cost of local farm expenses down. Any remaining boxes or cardboard that may be unsuitable for reuse are recycled.
Also, any “scratch and dent” fresh produce items are reduced in price for the general public to purchase...
Anything not suitable for price reduction is used by Mana’s in-house juice department and kitchen to create fresh juices or “ready-made” dishes.
Any items not suitable for processing are composted in special compost bins and used by several local farmers in organic composting projects.
We believe that when it comes to the environment, every little bit counts. We’re proud to be part of this community, and equally as proud to be able to run our business in ways that leave as small of a footprint as possible. Mahalo from all of us at Mana!

We work on two related areas: (1) life history biology and (2) metamorphosis. 80% of animal species have a life history that includes a metamorphosis. We use surveys and experiments with amphibians that allow us to understand the relationship between metamorphosis and life history evolution.
We perform several kinds of studies but in particular we use (1) time-series collections of animals that allow us to elucidate life history parameters like growth rate, size/age at metamorphosis, and size/age at sexual maturation and (2) laboratory growth experiments with amphibian larvae wherein environmental variables that affect growth are manipulated and the outcome on timing and size at metamorphosis are observed.

The newly skinny Karl Lagerfeld has been known to say unloving things about over sized women. He surely does not want to design for them. At the Fendi show, he talked about how women, in order to pull off the new lingerie as outerwear look, need to eat healthy, and not eat sweets. As the queen of the fashion industry, that statement could be compared to Marie Antoinette famous line, but revised here, “Let them not eat cake”.

Timur (from the Perso-Arabic form , ultimately from Chagatai (Middle Turkic) "iron"; 8 April 1336 – 18 February 1405), also known as Tamerlane (from "Timur the Lame"), was a 14th-century conqueror of much of western and central Asia, and or Pirnazar founder of the Timurid Empire and Timurid dynasty (1370–1405) in Central Asia, which survived until 1857 as the Mughal Empire of India.
A descendant of Mongol conquerors, Timur - whose tribe had become Turkicized in identity and language and Persianized in culture and religion - aspired to recreate the empire of his ancestors. He was a military genius who loved to play chess in his spare time to improve his military tactics and skill. And although he wielded absolute power, he never called himself more than an emir.
Timur was in his lifetime a controversial figure, and remains so today. He sought to restore the Mongol Empire, yet his heaviest blow was against the Islamized Mongol Golden Horde. He was more at home in an urban environment than on the steppe. He styled himself a ghazi yet some Muslim states, e.g. the Ottoman Empire were impacted severely by his wars. A great patron of the arts, his campaigns also caused vast destruction. Timur told the qadis of Aleppo , during the sack of that newly-conquered city,"I am not a man of blood; and God is my witness that in all my wars I have never been the aggressor, and that my enemies have always been the authors of their own calamity."
His full name in the Arabic tradition of ism, nasba, and nisbat was Tīmūr bin Taraġay Barlas.Temür means "iron" in the Chagatai language and in Mongolian (compare Temüjin "ironworker", the given name of Genghis Khan). The term temür is ultimately derived from a Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit word *čimara ("iron").
At the point he reached Adulthood he was better knownn and called as Timūr Gurkānī ( ), Gurkān being the Persianized form of the original Mongolian word kürügän, "son-in-law", the title bestowed upon his ancestors due to the fact, that first person in Timur's ancestors who was by the name "kara-sharnoban", embraced Islam and married the daughter of Chagatai Khan, the son of Genghis Khan, thus became son-in-law of Chagatai Khan.
Various Persian sources use a byname, Tīmūr-e Lang ( ) which translates to "Timur the Lame", as he was lame after sustaining an injury to the leg in battle. During his lifetime his enemies used to tease him with it, much to Timur's discomfort.In the West, he is commonly known as Tamerlane, which derives from his Persian byname.
Timur was born in Transoxiana, in City of Kesh (an area now better known as Shahrisabz , 'the green city,'), some 50 miles south of Samarkand in modern Uzbekistan . His father Taraqai was a little landowner and belonged to the Barlas, a nomadic Turkized Mongol tribe in the steppes of Central Asia. They were remnants of the original Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan, many of whom had embraced Turkic or Iranian languages and customs.Timur was a Muslim, his official religious counselor was the Hanafite scholar 'Abdu 'l-Jabbar Khwarazmi. He also constructed one of his finest buildings at the tomb of Ahmed Yesevi, an influential Turkic Sufi saint who was spreading Sunni Islam among the nomads.
In about 1360 Timur gained prominence as a military leader whose troops were mostly Turkic tribesmen of the region. Timur in The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001-2005. "Tamerlane, c.1336–1405, Turkic conqueror, b. Kesh, near Samarkand. He is also called Timur Leng (Faisal R.). The son of a tribal leader, in 1370 Timur became an in-law of a direct descendant of Genghis Khan, when he destoyed the army of Husayn of Balkh. After the battle, he took Husayn of Balkh's widow, Saray Mulk-khanum (daughter of Qazan, the last Chaghatai Khan of Mawarannah, into his harem as his fourth wife. For the rest of his life he called himself Temur Gurgan - son-in-law- of the Great Khan . Supported by an army of Turkish tribes, Timur spent his early military career subduing his rivals in what is now Turkistan; by 1369 he controlled the entire area from his capital at Samarkand.". He took part in campaigns in Transoxania with the Khan of Chagatai, a fellow descendant of Genghis Khan. His career for the next ten or eleven years may be thus briefly summarized from the Memoirs. Allying himself both in cause and by family connection with Kurgan, the dethroner and destroyer of Volga Bulgaria, he was to invade Khorasan at the head of a thousand horsemen. This was the second military expedition which he led, and its success led to further operations, among them the subjection of Khwarizm and Urganj .
After the murder of Kurgan the disputes which arose among the many claimants to sovereign power were halted by the invasion of the energetic Jagataite Tughlugh Timur of Kashgar , another descendant of Genghis Khan. Timur was dispatched on a mission to the invader's camp, the result of which was his own appointment to the head of his own tribe, the Barlas, in place of its former leader, Hajji Beg.
The exigencies of Timur's quasi-sovereign position compelled him to have recourse to his formidable patron, whose reappearance on the banks of the Syr Darya created a consternation not easily allayed. The Barlas were taken from Timur and entrusted to a son of Tughluk, along with the rest of Mawarannahr; but he was defeated in battle by the bold warrior he had replaced at the head of a numerically far inferior force.
Tughlugh's death facilitated the work of reconquest, and a few years of perseverance and energy sufficed for its accomplishment, as well as for the addition of a vast extent of territory. It was in this period that Timur reduced the Jagatai khans to the position of figureheads, who were deferred to in theory but in reality ignored, while Timur ruled in their name. During this period Timur and his brother-in-law Husayn, at first fellow fugitives and wanderers in joint adventures full of interest and romance, became rivals and antagonists. At the close of 1369 Husayn was assassinated and Timur, having been formally proclaimed sovereign at Balkh , mounted the throne at Samarkand, the capital of his dominions. This event was recorded by Marlowe in his famous work Tamburlaine the Great:
A legendary account of Timur's rise to leadership, recorded among the Tatar descendants of the Qıpchaq Khanate in Tobol , goes as follows:
It is notable that Timur never claimed for himself the title of khan, styling himself amir and acting in the name of the Chagatai ruler of Transoxania. Timur was a military genius but sometimes lacking in political sense. He tended not to leave a government apparatus behind in lands he conquered, and was often faced with the need to conquer such lands again after inevitable rebellions.
Timur spent the next 35 years in various wars and expeditions. He not only consolidated his rule at home by the subjugation of his foes, but sought extension of territory by encroachments upon the lands of foreign potentates. His conquests to the west and northwest led him among the Mongols of the Caspian Sea and to the banks of the Ural and the Volga. Conquests in the south and south-West encompassed almost every province in Persia, including Baghdad , Karbala and Northern Iraq .
One of the most formidable of Timur's opponents was another Mongol ruler, a descendant of Genghis Khan named Tokhtamysh. After having been a refugee in Timur's court, Tokhtamysh became ruler both of the eastern Kipchak and the Golden Horde. After his accidence, he then quarreled with Timur over the possession of Khwarizm and Azerbaijan . However, Timur still supported him against the Russians and in 1382 Tokhtamysh invaded the Muscovite dominion and burned Moscow .
After the death of Abu Sa'id, ruler of the Ilkhanid Dynasty, in 1335, there was a power vacuum in the Persian Empire. In 1383 Timur started the military conquest of Persia. He captured Herat , Khorasan and all eastern Persia by 1385 and captured almost all of Persia by 1387. These conquests were characterised by exceptional brutality. For example, when Isfahan surrendered to Timur in 1387, he initially treated it with relative mercy as he commonly did with cities that surrendered without resistance. However, after the city revolted against Timur's punitive taxes by killing the tax collectors and some of Timur's soldiers, Timur ordered the complete massacre of the city, killing a reported 70,000 citizens. An eye-witness counted more than 28 towers, each constructed of about 1,500 heads.
In the meantime, Tokhtamysh, now khan of the Golden Horde, turned against his patron and invaded Azerbaijan in 1385. This action would cause a counter by Timur that would become the Tokhtamysh–Timur war. In the initial stage of the war, Timur won a victory at the Battle of the Kondurcha River, however Tokhtamysh and his army were allowed to escape. After Tokhtamysh's initial defeat, Timur then invaded Muscovy to the north of Tokhtamysh's holdings. Timur's army burned Raizan and advanced upon Moscow, only to be pulled away before reaching the Oka River by Tokhtamysh's renewed campaign in the south. In 1395, at the Battle of the Terek River, Tokhtamysh's power was finally broken concluding the titanic struggle between the two monarchs. In this Tokhtamysh–Timur war, Timur first led an army of over 100,000 men north for more than 700 miles into the uninhabited steppe, then west about 1000 miles, advancing in a front more than 10 miles wide. The Timurid army almost starved, and Timur organized a great hunt where the army encircled vast areas of steppe to get food. Tokhtamysh's army finally was cornered against the Volga River in the Orenburg region and destroyed (See Battle of the Terek River). During this march, Timur's army got far enough north to be in a region of very long summer days, causing complaints by his Muslim soldiers about keeping a long schedule of prayers in such northern regions. Timur during the course of his campaign destroyed Sarai, the capital of the Golden Horde, and Astrakhan , subsequently wrecking the Golden Horde's economy based on Silk Road trade.
Timur began a trek starting in 1398 to invade the reigning Sultan Nasir-u Din Mehmud of the Tughlaq Dynasty in the north Indian city of Delhi . His campaign was politically pretexted that the Muslim Delhi Sultanate was too tolerant toward its Hindu subjects, but that could not mask the real reason being to amass the wealth of the Delhi Sultanate.
Timur crossed the Indus River at Attock (now Pakistan ) on September 24, 1398, but Timur's invasion did not go unopposed and he did meet some resistance during his march to Delhi, by the Governor of Meerut . Timur was able to continue his relentless approach to Delhi, arriving in 1398 to combat the armies of Sultan Mehmud, already weakened by an internal battle for ascension within the royal family.
The Sultan's army was easily defeated on December 17, 1398. On this day the army of Sultan Mahmud Khan had prepared 120 war elephants armored with chain mail. He had put poison on the tusks, which put fright into the Tatar lines. Timur took action and the Tatars dug out a trench in front of their positions. Timur then took his camels and placed all the wood and hay he could on their backs. When the war elephants charged he lit the camels on fire and then prodded them with iron sticks. They charged at the elephants howling in pain. Timur had understood that elephants were easy creatures of panic. Faced with the strange specter of the burning camels flying straight at them with flames leaping from their backs, the elephants turned around and stampeded back toward their own lines. Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins. Before the battle for Delhi, Timur executed a large number of captives, mostly Hindus.
Timur himself recorded the invasions in his memoirs, collectively known as Tuzk-e-Taimuri‎. In them, he vividly described the massacre at Delhi :
Timur further describes as below in Tuzk-e-Taimuri‎ how he and his army massacred the Hindus population of Delhi after conquering it.
As per Malfuzat-i-Timuri, Timur targeted Hindus. In his own words, "Excepting the quarter of the saiyids, the 'ulama and the other Musalmans [sic], the whole city was sacked". In his descriptions of the Loni massacre he wrote, "Next day I gave orders that the Musalman prisoners should be separated and saved."
Timur left Delhi in approximately January 1399. In April he had returned to his own capital beyond the Oxus (Amu Darya). Immense quantities of spoils were taken from India. According to Ruy Gonzáles de Clavijo, 90 captured elephants were employed merely to carry precious stones looted from his conquest, so as to erect a mosque at Samarkand what historians today believe is the enormous Bibi-Khanym Mosque . Ironically, the mosque was constructed too quickly and suffered greatly from disrepair within a few decades of its construction.
Before the end of 1399, Timur started a war with Bayezid I, sultan of the Ottoman Empire, and the Mamluk sultan of Egypt . Bayezid began annexing the territory of Turkmen and Muslim rulers in Anatolia . As Timur claimed sovereignty over the Turkmen rulers, they took refuge behind him. Timur invaded Syria, sacked Aleppo and captured Damascus after defeating the Mamluk army. The city's inhabitants were massacred, except for the artisans, who were deported to Samarkand. This led to Timur's being publicly declared an enemy of Islam.
In 1400 Timur invaded Armenia and Georgia (see also Timur's invasions of Georgia). More than 60,000 people from the Caucasus were captured as slaves, and many districts were depopulated.
He invaded Baghdad in June 1401. After the capture of the city, 20,000 of its citizens including Muslims were massacred. Timur ordered that every soldier should return with at least two severed human heads to show him (many warriors were so scared they killed prisoners captured earlier in the campaign just to ensure they had heads to present to Timur). After years of insulting letters passed between Timur and Bayezid, Timur invaded Anatolia and defeated Bayezid in the Battle of Ankara on July 20, 1402. Bayezid was captured in battle and subsequently died in captivity, initiating the 12-year Ottoman Interregnum period. Timur's stated motivation for attacking Bayezid and the Ottoman Empire was the restoration of Seljuq authority. Timur saw the Seljuks as the rightful rulers of Anatolia as they had been granted rule by Mongol conquerors, illustrating again Timur's interest with Genghizid legitimacy.
Timur's army ravaged Western Anatolia, with Muslim writers complaining that the Timurid army acted more like a horde of savages than that of a civilized conqueror. After the Battle of Ankara, Timur did take the city of Smyrna, a stronghold of the Knights Hospitalers, thus he referred to himself as ghazi. Timur was furious at the Genoese and Venetians whose ships ferried the Ottoman army to safety in Thrace. As Lord Kinross reported in The Ottoman Centuries, the Italians preferred the enemy they knew to the one they did not.
By 1368, the Ming had driven the Mongols out of China . The first Ming Emperor Hongwu demanded, and received, homage from many Central Asian states paid to China as the political heirs to the former House of Kublai. Although Timur more than once sent to the Ming Government tributes after he had imprisoned the Chinese envoys for several months, he wished to restore the Mongol Empire, and eventually planned to conquer China. To this end, Timur made an alliance with the Mongols of the Northern Yuan Dynasty and prepared all the way to Bukhara. The Mongol leader Enkhe Khan sent his grandson Öljei Temür, also known as Buyanshir Khan. In December 1404, Timur started military campaigns against the Ming Dynasty and detained the Ming envoy, but he was attacked by fever and plague when encamped on the farther side of the Sihon (Syr-Daria ) and died at Atrar (Otrar ) in mid-February 1405. His scouts explored Mongolia before his death, and the writing they carved on trees in Mongolia's mountains could still be seen even in the 20th century.
Although he preferred to fight his battles in the spring, Timur died enroute during an uncharacteristic winter campaign against the ruling Chinese Ming Dynasty . It was one of the bitterest winters on record; his troops are recorded as having to dig through five feet of ice to reach drinking water. Records indicate though, that for part of his life at least, he was a surreptitious Ming vassal and that his son Shah Rukh visited China in 1420. He ruled over an empire that, in modern times, extends from southeastern Turkey , Syria , Iraq , Kuwait and Iran , through Central Asia encompassing part of Kazakhstan , Afghanistan , Armenia , Azerbaijan , Georgia , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , Kyrgyzstan , Pakistan , North-Western India, and even approaches Kashgar in China. Northern Iraq remained predominantly Assyrian Christian until attacked, looted, plundered and destroyed by Timur leaving its population decimated by systematic mass slaughter. All churches were destroyed and any survivors forcefully converted to Islam by the sword.Of Timur's four sons, two (Jahangir and Umar Shaykh) predeceased him. His third son, Miran Shah, died soon after Timur, leaving the youngest son, Shah Rukh. Although his designated successor was his grandson Pir Muhammad b. Jahangir, Timur was ultimately succeeded in power by his son Shah Rukh. His most illustrious descendant Babur founded the Mughal Empire and ruled over most of Pakistan and North India. Babur's descendants Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb, expanded the Mughal Empire to most of the Indian subcontinent along with parts of modern Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Markham, in his introduction to the narrative of Clavijo's embassy, states that his body "was embalmed with musk and rose water, wrapped in linen, laid in an ebony coffin and sent to Samarkand , where it was buried." His tomb, the Gur-e Amir , still stands in Samarkand, though it has been heavily restored in recent years. Timur had carried his victorious arms on one side from the Irtish and the Volga to the Persian Gulf , and on the other from the Hellespont to the Ganges River .
Timur became widely known as a patron to the arts. Much of the architecture he commissioned still stands in Samarkand , now in present-day Uzbekistan . He was known to bring the most talented artisans from the lands he conquered back to Samarkand, and is credited with often giving them a wide latitude of artistic freedom to express themselves.
According to legend, Omar Aqta, Timur's court calligrapher, transcribed the Qur'an using letters so small that the entire text of the book fit on a signet ring. Omar also is said to have created a Qur'an so large that a wheelbarrow was required to transport it. Folio of what is probably this larger Qur'an have been found, written in gold lettering on huge pages.
Timur was also said to have created Tamerlane Chess, a variant of shatranj (also known as medieval chess) played on a larger board with several additional pieces and an original method of pawn promotion. These pieces included the camel, siege-weapon, giraffe, and several others as well as boasting a complicated system involving the ability to exchange pawns for certain pieces should they reach the other side of the board.
Timur's mandating of Kurash wrestling for his soldiers ensured for it a lasting and legendary legacy. Kurash is now a popular international sport and part of the Asian Games.
Timur had numerous epistolary exchanges with Western, especially French, rulers. The French archives preserve:
A July 30, 1402, letter from Timur to Charles VI, king of France, suggesting him to send traders to the Orient. It was written in Persian.
A May 1403 letter. This is a Latin transcription of a letter from Timur to Charles VI, and another from Amiza Miranchah, his son, to the Christian princes, announcing their victory over Bayezid, in Smyrna .
Timur's legacy is a mixed one. While Central Asia blossomed under his reign, other places such as Baghdad, Damascus, Delhi and other Arab, Persian, Indian and Turkic cities were sacked and destroyed. Thus, while Timur still retains a positive image in Central Asia, he is vilified by many in Arab, Persian and Indian societies.
Timur's military talents were unique. He used propaganda in what is now called information warfare as part of his tactics. His campaigns were preceded by the deployment of spies whose tasks included collecting information and spreading horrifying reports about the cruelty, size, and might of Timur’s armies. Such disinformation eventually weakened the morale of threatened populations and caused panic among enemy forces. He planned all his campaigns years in advance, including planting barley for horse feed two-years ahead of his campaigns. Whilst Timur’s uncharacteristic (for the time) concern for his troops inspired fierce loyalty he did not pay them. Their only incentives were from looting captured territory — a bounty that included horses, wives, precious metals and stones; in other words whatever they, or their newly indentured slaves, could carry away from the conquered lands.
Timur's short-lived empire also melded the Turko-Persian tradition in Transoxiania, and in most of the territories which he incorporated into his fiefdom, Persian became the primary language of administration and literary culture (diwan), regardless of ethnicity. In addition, during his reign, some contributions to Turkic literature were penned, with Turkic cultural influence expanding and flourishing as a result. A literary form of Chagatai Turkic came into use alongside Persian as both a cultural and an official language.
Timur became a popular figure in Europe for centuries after his death, not in the least because of his victory over the Ottoman Sultan and the humiliations to which he is said to have subjected his prisoner Bayezid.
Timur was officially recognized as a national hero of newly independent Uzbekistan . His monument in Tashkent takes the place where Marx's statue once stood.
Timur's generally recognized biographers are Ali Yazdi, commonly called Sharaf ud-Din, author of the Zafarnāmeh in Persian (ظفرنامه), translated by Petis de la Croix in 1722 , and from French into English by J. Darby in the following year; and Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Abdallah, al-Dimashiqi, al-Ajami (commonly called Ahmad Ibn Arabshah) translated by the Dutch Orientalist Colitis in 1636. In the work of the former, as Sir William Jones remarks, "the Tatarian conqueror is represented as a liberal, benevolent and illustrious prince", in that of the latter he is "deformed and impious, of a low birth and detestable principles." But the favourable account was written under the personal supervision of Timur's grandson, Ibrahim, while the other was the production of his direst enemy.
Among less reputed biographies or materials for biography may be mentioned a second Zafarnāmeh, by Nizam al-Din Shami, stated to be the earliest known history of Timur, and the only one written in his lifetime. Timur's purported autobiography, the Tuzk-e-Taimuri ("Memoirs of Temur") is a later fabrication, although most of the historical facts are accurate.
Timur's body was exhumed from his tomb in 1941 by the Soviet anthropologist Mikhail M. Gerasimov. From his bones it was clear that Timur was a tall and broad chested man with strong cheek bones. Gerasimov also found that Timur's facial characteristics conformed to partial Mongoloid features, which he believed, in some part, supported Timur's notion that he was descended from Genghis Khan. Gerasimov was able to reconstruct the likeness of Timur from his skull. His height was 5 foot 8 inches (1.73 meters), tall for his era. He also confirmed Timur's lameness due to a hip injury.
Timur's tomb is protected by a slab of jade in which are carved the words in Arabic: "When I rise, the World will Tremble".
It is said that when Gerasimov exhumed the body, an additional inscription inside the casket was found reading "Whosoever opens my tomb shall unleash an invader more terrible than I." In any case, two days after Gerasimov had begun the exhumation, Nazi Germany launched Operation Barbarossa, its invasion of the U.S.S.R. Timur was re-buried with full Islamic ritual in November 1942 just before the Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad (ref Marozzi 2004)

" Timur" The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition, 2001-05. Quotation: Tamerlane, c.1336–1405, Mongol conqueror, b. Kesh, near Samarkand. He is also called Timur Leng [Timur the lame]. He was the son of a tribal leader, and he claimed (apparently for the first time in 1370) to be a descendant of Jenghiz Khan. With an army composed of Turks and Turkic-speaking Mongols, remnants of the empire of the Mongols, Timur spent his early military career in subduing his rivals in what is now Turkistan; by 1369 he firmly controlled the entire area from his capital at Samarkand.
Manz, Beatrice Forbes (1999). The Rise and Rule of Tamerlane. Cambridge University Press, p.109. ISBN 0521633842. . p.109. "In Temür's government, as in those of most nomad dynasties, it is impossible to find a clear distinction between civil and military affairs, or to identify the Persian bureaucracy as solely civil or the Turko-Mongolian solely with military government. In fact, it is difficult to define the sphere of either side of the administration and we find Persians and Chaghatays sharing many tasks. (In discussing the settled bureaucracy and the people who worked within it I use the word Persian in a cultural rather than ethnological sense. In almost all the territories which Temür incorporated into his realm Persian was the primary language of administration and literary culture. Thus the language of the settled 'diwan' was Persian and its scribes had to be thoroughly adept in Persian culture, whatever their ethnic origin.) Temür's Chaghatay emirs were often involved in civil and provincial administration and even in financial affairs, traditionally the province of Persian bureaucracy."

Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov ( , Vjačeslav Michajlovič Molotov; – 8 November, 1986) was a Soviet politician and diplomat, a leading figure in the Soviet government from the 1920s, when he rose to power as a protégé of Joseph Stalin, to 1957, when he was dismissed from Presidium (Politburo) of the Central Committee by Nikita Khrushchev. He was a major perpetrator of the Great Terror and the principal Soviet signatory of the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact of 1939 (also known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) as well as post-war negotiations. The Molotov cocktail was named after him by the Finnish military during the Winter War.
Molotov was born Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Skriabin (Вячеслав Михайлович Скря́бин) in the village of Kukarka (now Sovetsk in Kirov Oblast ), the son of a shop clerk. Contrary to a commonly repeated error, he was not related to the composer Alexander Scriabin. He was educated at a secondary school in Kazan , and joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1906. For his political work he took the pseudonym Molotov (from the Russian molot, "hammer"). He was arrested in 1909 and spent two years in exile in Vologda . In 1911 he enrolled at the St Petersburg Polytechnic, and also joined the editorial staff of Pravda, the underground Bolshevik newspaper, of which Joseph Stalin was editor. In 1913 Molotov was again arrested and deported to Irkutsk , but in 1915 he escaped and returned to the capital.
In 1916, Molotov became a member of Bolshevik Party's committee in Petrograd . When the February Revolution broke out in February 1917, he was one of the few Bolsheviks of any standing in the capital. Under his direction Pravda took a turn "left" in opposing the Provisional Government which was formed after the revolution. Consequently, when Stalin returned to the capital, he reversed Molotov's line. However, when the party leader, Vladimir Lenin, arrived, he overruled Stalin. Despite this, Molotov became a protégé and close adherent of Stalin, an alliance to which he owed not only his later prominence, but almost certainly his life as well; Molotov was one of only four of the leading Old Bolsheviks to survive the Great Purges. The other three were Kalinin (d. 1946), Alexandra Kollontai (d. 1952) and Stalin (d.1953) himself. Molotov became a member of the Military Revolutionary Committee which planned the October Revolution (effectively bringing the Bolsheviks to power).
In 1918, Molotov was sent to Ukraine to take part in civil war then breaking out. Since he was not a military man, Molotov took no part in the fighting. In 1920, he became secretary to the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Bolshevik Party. Lenin recalled him to Moscow in 1921, elevating him to full membership in the Central Committee and Orgburo, and putting him in charge of the party secretariat. In 1922, Stalin became General Secretary of the Bolshevik Party with Molotov as the de facto "second" secretary. Under Stalin's patronage, Molotov became a member of the Politburo in 1926.
During the power struggles which followed Lenin's death in 1924, Molotov remained a loyal supporter of Stalin against his various rivals: first Leon Trotsky, later Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev and finally Nikolai Bukharin. He became a leading figure in the "Stalinist centre" of the party, which also included Kliment Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich, Sergo Ordzhonikidze and Sergei Kirov. Trotsky and his supporters underestimated Molotov as many others did. Trotsky called him "mediocrity personified", whilst Molotov himself pedantically corrected comrades referring to him as 'Stone-Arse' by saying that Lenin had actually dubbed him 'Iron Arse'. However, this outward dullness concealed a sharp mind and great administrative talent. He operated mainly behind the scenes and cultivated an image as a colourless bureaucrat - for example, he was the only Bolshevik leader who always wore a suit and tie (Lenin's attire routine changed in the later years).
When Bukharin's ally, Alexei Rykov, was removed as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars (the equivalent of a prime minister) in December 1930, Molotov succeeded him. In this post, he oversaw the Stalin regime's collectivisation of agriculture. Molotov carried out Stalin's line of using a combination of force and propaganda to crush peasant resistance to collectivisation, including the deportation of millions of kulaks (peasants with property) to labour camps. An enormous number of the deportees died from exposure and overwork. He signed the "Law of Spikelets" and personally led the Extraordinary Commission for Grain Delivery in Ukraine, which seized a reported 4.2 million tonnes of grain from the peasants, during a widespread famine (known in Ukraine as Holodomor). Contemporary historians estimate that between seven and eleven million people died, either of starvation or in labour camps, in the move to collectivise farms. Molotov also oversaw the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan for rapid industrialisation.
Sergei Kirov was assassinated by an oppositionist sympathizer in 1934. This is now believed by some historians (notably Edvard Radzinsky in his book 'Stalin') to have been ordered by Stalin, triggering a second crisis, the Great Purge. This purge acquired momentum through 1935 and 1936 and culminated in 1937-38 in the Moscow Trials, in which most of the pre-Stalin Bolshevik leaders were convicted on usually fabricated charges of treason and espionage, and millions of other Russians were deported to labour camps . Although the purges were carried out by Stalin's successive police chiefs, Genrikh Yagoda, Nikolai Yezhov and Lavrenty Beria, Molotov was intimately involved in the processes. Stalin frequently required him and other Politburo members to sign the death warrants of prominent purge victims, and Molotov always did so without question. There is no record of Molotov attempting to moderate the course of the purges or even to save individuals, as some other Soviet leaders did. During the Great Terror, he personally approved 372 documented execution lists, more than anybody other, including Stalin himself.
Despite the great human cost, the Soviet Union under Molotov's nominal prime ministership made great strides in the adoption and widespread implementation of agrarian and industrial technology (See command economy). The rise of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany gave the development of a modern armaments industry great urgency and Molotov and the commissar of industry, Lazar Kaganovich, were primarily responsible for guiding this success. Ultimately, it was this arms industry which enabled the Soviet Union to prevail in World War II. However, the purges of the Red Army leadership, in which Molotov participated, weakened the Soviet Union's defence capacity. This somewhat contributed to the military disasters of 1941 and 1942, which were mostly caused by unreadiness for war. It also led to the dismantling of the peasant class and its replacement by collectivised agriculture left a legacy of chronic agricultural under-production which the Soviet regime never fully overcame.
Following the purges, Molotov was generally regarded as Stalin's deputy and as his long-term successor, although Molotov was careful not to encourage any such suggestion. The American journalist John Gunther wrote in 1938: "Molotov has a fine forehead, and looks and acts like a French professor of medicine - orderly, precise, pedantic. He is... a man of first-rate intelligence and influence. Molotov is a vegetarian and a teetotaller. Stalin gives him much of the dirty work to do".
In 1939, following the Munich Agreement and Hitler's subsequent invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938, Stalin believed that Britain and France would not be reliable allies against German expansion so instead sought to conciliate Germany. In May 1939, Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov (who, in addition to being Jewish, was also viewed as pro-Western) was dismissed, and Molotov was appointed to succeed him. Molotov remained at the head of the Sovnarkom until May 1941, when Stalin took over as the official head of the Soviet government.
At first, Hitler rebuffed Soviet diplomatic hints that Stalin desired a treaty, but in early August, he authorised Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to begin serious negotiations. A trade agreement was concluded on 18 August, and on 22 August, Ribbentrop flew to Moscow to conclude a formal non-aggression treaty. Although the treaty is known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Molotov and Ribbentrop acted only as agents for their masters, Stalin and Hitler. The most important part of the agreement was the secret protocol, which provided for the partition of Poland , Finland and the Baltic States between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and for the Soviet annexation of Bessarabia (then part of Romania , now Moldova ). This protocol gave Hitler the green light for his invasion of Poland, which began on 1 September.
Under the terms of the Pact, Stalin was, in effect, given authorisation to occupy and annex Estonia , Latvia and Bessarabia , as well as the part of Poland east of the Curzon Line (an area in which Ukrainians and Belorussians comprised the majority of the population). He was also given a free hand in relation to Finland . In the Soviet-Finnish War that ensued, a combination of fierce Finnish resistance and Soviet mismanagement resulted in Finland losing parts of its territory, but not its independence. During this conflict, the Finns coined the term Molotov cocktail for a homemade incendiary device to be used against tanks. Germany was authorised to occupy the western two-thirds of Poland (much of which was annexed to Germany), as well as Lithuania , but the Pact was later amended to allocate Lithuania to the Soviet sphere in exchange for a more favourable border in Poland. All these annexations led to massive suffering and loss of life in the countries which were occupied and partitioned by the two dictatorships.
In November 1940 Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to meet von Ribbentrop and Hitler (see German–Soviet Axis talks#Molotov travels to Berlin).
The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact governed Soviet-German relations until June 1941 when Hitler, having occupied France and neutralised Britain , turned east and attacked the Soviet Union . Molotov was also responsible for telling the Soviet people of the attack, when he announced the war, instead of Joseph Stalin. His speech, broadcast by radio on June 22, played in Russia a role similar to Winston Churchill's wartime speeches to Britain.
Following the invasion, Molotov conducted urgent negotiations with Britain and, later, the United States for wartime alliances. Via Pe-8 bomber he travelled over the frontline to London and Washington in May 1942. The flight over territories occupied by Germany, scanned by AAA's and Luftwaffe, was so difficult and dangerous, that Molotov's pilot, Endel Puusepp, was made Hero of the Soviet Union for completing it. Upon arrival Molotov signed the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of Alliance and also secured Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill's agreement to create a "second front" in Europe.
Molotov accompanied Stalin to the Teheran Conference in 1943, the Yalta Conference in 1945 and the Potsdam Conference, which followed the defeat of Germany. He represented the Soviet Union at the San Francisco Conference, which created the United Nations. Even during the period of wartime alliance, Molotov was known as a tough negotiator and determined defender of Soviet interests. In this he was carrying out Stalin's wishes.
From 1945 to 1947 Molotov took part in all four conferences of foreign ministers of the victorious states in the Second World War. In general, he was distinguished by an uncooperative attitude towards the Western powers.
Winston Churchill in his wartime memoirs lists many meetings with Molotov. Acknowledging him as a "man of outstanding ability and cold-blooded ruthlessness," Churchill concluded: "In the conduct of foreign affairs, Mazarin, Talleyrand, Metternich, would welcome him to their company, if there be another world to which Bolsheviks allow themselves to go."
In the postwar period, Molotov's position began to decline. In 1949, he was replaced as Foreign Minister by Andrey Vyshinsky, although retaining his position as Deputy Prime Minister and membership of the Politburo. Following the death of Andrei Zhdanov, who had come to be seen as Stalin's most likely successor, Stalin and Beria began to plan a new purge, which would have removed most of the older party leaders such as Molotov from their positions. New leaders, such as Georgii Malenkov and Nikita Khrushchev, enjoyed Stalin's patronage.
A clear sign of Molotov's precarious position was his inability to prevent the arrest of his Jewish wife, Polina Zhemchuzhina, in December 1948 for "treason". Stalin had long distrusted her. The couple were reunited by Beria upon the death of Stalin. At the 19th Party Congress in 1952, Molotov was elected to the new, expanded Presidium of the Communist Party but was excluded from the smaller standing committee of the Presidium (although this was not made public). It seems likely that Stalin's death in March 1953 saved Molotov from being purged as part of a "clean out" of the Soviet leadership.
Following Stalin's death, a realignment of the leadership was sought, in the course of which Molotov's position was strengthened. Beria was purged and executed, and Molotov regained the Foreign Ministry under Malenkov as Prime Minister. However, the new Party Secretary, Khrushchev, soon emerged as the real power in the regime. He presided over a gradual domestic liberalisation and a "thaw" in foreign policy, shown by the reconciliation with Tito's government in Yugoslavia (which Stalin had expelled from the communist movement). Molotov, an old-guard Stalinist, seemed increasingly out of place in this new environment, but he represented the Soviet Union with his usual tenacity at the Geneva Conference of 1955 which discussed European security, German reunification and disarmament.
The events which led to Molotov's downfall began in February 1956 when Khrushchev launched an unexpected denunciation of Stalin at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party. Khrushchev attacked Stalin both over the purges of the 1930s and the defeats of the early years of World War II, which he blamed on Stalin's over-trusting attitude to Hitler and the purges of the Red Army. Since Molotov was most senior of Stalin's collaborators still alive and had played a leading role in the purges, it became obvious that Khrushchev's examination into the past would probably result in Molotov's fall from power. Consequently, he became the leader of the "old guard" in resisting Khrushchev, although whether he actually plotted to overthrow Khrushchev, as was later alleged , is not clear.
In June 1956, Molotov was removed as Foreign Minister, and in June 1957 was expelled from the Presidium (Politburo) following a failed attempt to remove Khrushchev as First Secretary. Although Molotov's faction initially won a vote in the Presidium 7-4 to remove Khrushchev, the latter refused to resign unless a Central Committee plenum decided so. In the plenum, which lasted from 22 to 29 June, Molotov and his faction were defeated. Eventually he was banished as ambassador to Mongolia . In 1960, he was appointed Soviet representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency , which was seen as a partial rehabilitation. However, after the 22nd Party Congress in 1961, during which Khrushchev carried his de-Stalinisation campaign to remove Stalin's body from Lenin's Mausoleum , Molotov was removed from all positions and expelled from the Communist Party. In March 1962, it was announced that Molotov had retired from public life.
In retirement, Molotov remained totally unrepentant about his role during Stalin's period of rule. After the Sino-Soviet split, it was reported that he agreed with the criticisms made by Mao Zedong of the supposed "revisionism" of Khrushchev's policies. According to Roy Medvedev, Stalin's daughter, Svetlana, recalled Molotov and his wife telling her: "Your father was a genius. There's no revolutionary spirit around nowadays, just opportunism everywhere. China's our only hope! Only they have kept alive the revolutionary spirit". In 1976, he said:
"The fact that atomic war may break out, isn't that class struggle? There is no alternative to class struggle. This is a very serious question. The be-all and end-all is not peaceful coexistence. After all, we have been holding on for some time, and under Stalin we held on to the point where the imperialists felt able to demand point-blank: either surrender such and such positions, or it means war. So far the imperialists haven't renounced that".
Molotov was partly rehabilitated during the Leonid Brezhnev years and was allowed to rejoin the Communist Party in 1984 under Konstantin Chernenko. He died at the age of 96 in Moscow in November 1986, only five years before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. At the time of his death he was the last surviving major participant in the events of 1917. He was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery , Moscow . A collection of interviews with Molotov, "Molotov Remembers: Inside Kremlin Politics", was published posthumously by Felix Chuev. In 2005 Molotov's grandson and namesake, Russian political scientist Vyacheslav Nikonov (born in 1956), wrote an early biography of him.
At the end of 1989, two years before the final collapse of the Soviet Union, the Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union and Mikhail Gorbachev's government formally denounced the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, acknowledging that the annexation of the Baltic States and the partition of Poland had been illegal.
Molotov was one of the few, if not the only person to have shaken hands with Soviet Premiers Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin, Chinese Chairman Mao Zedong, German leader Adolf Hitler, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. Presidents Franklin D.

This county atlas sampler gives some idea of what these books look like. An example of each type of page included is displayed. The standard page size was about 17 by 14 inches, or folio size. Lithograph scenes appear in some atlases, but not all. Compared to a Currier & Ives print, say, they are rather crude but still quite picturesque. Only a few atlases contain color lithographs. Maps were always hand colored using stencils which was cheaper than color printing by lithography.
Cover The covers are pressed cardboard, the same as hardback covers today, and of dark color. An abbreviated title of the atlas with author and publisher appears in lighter type. In the case of J. A. Howden, who put out this atlas of Warren County, the author and publisher were one. This cover is in decent shape.
Title Page Title pages could be quite ornate with insets of scenes, or a picture of the author. This one is the usual plainer type. The printing company would always be listed. On this page, Beach Nichols is the author, A. Pomeroy is the publisher, the maps and drawings were 'Eng'd' by Worley and Bracher, and the atlas was printed by F. Bourquin, all from Philadelphia.
Table of Contents All atlases have a table of contents, such as this one from the Jefferson County atlas. The page numbers are usually not consecutive. Blank pages, i.e. the verso of maps, were sometimes counted and sometimes not counted. Page numbers could be missing because they were set aside for maps or lithographs that were never made. Because of this, it is sometimes difficult to tell if an atlas is complete when the table of contents page is missing. (Well, obviously it isn't complete, at least one page is missing.) As if the page confusion wasn't enough, a few atlases had loose maps inserted within them after binding. Sometimes the name of the map, but no page number, is on the table of contents. In some other cases, there is no listing of the inserted map at all. These loose maps are usually missing from existing atlas copies.
History Some atlases contain a short history of the county, such as the sketch of Indiana County history presented here. These histories were written by a local history buff or by the atlas author.
Advertisements Almost, but not quite, all atlases carry ads. The atlases were financed by selling ad space and lithographs of views to individuals and businesses. Here is an ad page from the Clarion County Atlas.
A United States Map Some, but not all, atlases have a map of the United States. The same map was usually used in all the author or publisher's atlases. This map, from Caldwell's Clarion County atlas, appears in most of Caldwell's atlases. For some mysterious reason, it contains an inset of Newfoundland, of all places.
A Miscellaneous Map A few atlases also have one or two miscellaneous maps that have little to do with the county. This railroad map appears in the atlas of Clarion County.
A State Map Almost all the atlases contain a state map, only a few did not. The state map made by O. W. Gray & Son of Philadelphia was used in many atlases, and appears in this one of Westmoreland County.
A County Map All of the atlases include a county map, here is the one in the Crawford County atlas. This county, located in the northwest, was surveyed in square sections, as this map shows.
A City Map Atlases from counties lucky enough to contain a city usually have a large double page city map. This map of Williamsport, in Lycoming County, is surrounded by ads, not the usual practice. Williamsport, of course, is where the Little League World Series is held.
A Borough Map The maps of villages, towns, boroughs, and townships took up most of the pages in an atlas. This is a map of Cherry Tree and Hillsdale from the Indiana County atlas. Both towns are small, so every building and lot can be shown. Cherry Tree was a reference point for the Purchase of 1768. The boundaries of Indiana, Clearfield, and Cambria counties were modified after this map was made so all of Cherry Tree lies in Indiana County today.
A Township Map Townships and boroughs are the lowest level of local governance in Pennsylvania. All counties have townships and at least one borough. Hempfield Township lies in Westmoreland County. The scale of this map is small because Hempfield is a large township.
Courthouse Print A courthouse print appears in some atlases, such as this one of York County. One might think a courthouse view should appear in all atlases. One would be wrong; it only got in if someone paid. In this view, the two gentlemen who paid are prominently displayed.
Business Print Business prints were purchased as a form of advertising, such as this one from the Jefferson County atlas. A prosperous business might buy a two page spread, or one page as here. A cheap businessman might settle for just his name on the ad page. A cheaper businessman would not bother at all. This business is the 19th century equivalent of an automobile plant.
Church Print Churches had to pay just like everyone else and a half page view was cheaper than a full page. Clarion County views are shown here because it was one of the few atlases with color lithographs, printed by Otto Krebs of Pittsburgh.
Residence Print Again, these color views are from the Clarion County atlas. The color is rather pale in this copy. The quality of the color and of the images varies from atlas to atlas and even within different copies of the same atlas. Most of these county atlases came out in the centennial year of 1876 and people paid to have views of their homes out of civic pride, and perhaps just a little boastfulness. These homes are mirror images of one another and makes one question the accuracy of the representation.
Farm Print A farm is a combination business and residence. There are usually many farm views in those atlases that have lithograph prints. This one page view from the Washington County atlas is especially comprehensive, showing livestock, buildings, residence, and a panoramic view.
Panoramic Print This print is a panoramic view of a fairgrounds in Beaver County. The view point is almost high enough to be a 'bird's eye view' lithograph, which became all the rage from around 1870 to 1920 and are more detailed than the views appearing in the county atlases. This Beaver County atlas is one of the few with color prints.
Another Business Print This beautiful color view of the Western File Works appears in the front of the Beaver County atlas, and is as good as any Currier & Ives. It was 'engraved, lithographed, and printed' by Otto Krebs of Pittsburgh.
This issue, amthaipaper has the privilege to interview Mr Eugene Dwaah, the director of IFA where Cian Boonpen has been selected by him and been training here in the past months. IFA is one of the prestige academies in England where the potential boys being trained and brought into the professional football clubs later. Amthaipaper takes this opportunity to get further details about Cian, the first Thai young footballer who has played and been trained in the English prestige football clubs and how Cian’s going to be the star in the professional footballer career in the future.
Eugene: Basically, the academy is here to facilitate people who wish to become professional footballer. In England, club will select boys as young as six to seven years of age to go and train at their academy. The general feeling of that the boys should start at academy before the age of nine. Otherwise, they’re not going to be good enough. And I don’t believe in that. In Europe, Africa and South America, the boys come through much later age when they’re physically able to cope, socially and mentally able to cope at 13-15 years of age sometimes.
I have been working for 10 years for professional football clubs in England. I have been the head of recruitment for younger age groups and I watch boys been brought into the academy at very young age and been released at very young age and falling out of loving football and not enjoy anymore and stop playing football. First and foremost, our academy is about the enjoyment. The boys come here and they work very hard.
Eugene: There is a number of ways. I myself am trained as a scout, my colleagues: Andrew, Lee, Oscar, Peter, etc. are all been scouts for professional clubs. We are trained to spot young talents early before they’ve been brought to become professional footballers. We know what to look for.
Eugene: In England, the footballers are very much based on athletic ability which is to be proved to be wrong. For example, if you’re looking at Spanish and Brazilian’s where their game is about technical, based on techniques as the most important. In England, a lot of footballers are based on physical profile boys. So, what tends to happen is our structure, boys who want to play football play for a team and their mentality is to win. So, if you want to win, what you do is you place the biggest and strongest boys to win. And we play football in the winter, so, the boys who are small can’t play because our pitches are very bad and muddy. So, you can see the bigger boys show up well and then the bigger boys get seen from the professional football club and they brought them into the professional football club.
Technically, in football intelligence, these boys (who physical big profile) in general aren’t very good in technique. So, you have boys like Cian who is very technically and tactically very good and intelligent will be missed out by the majority of clubs because he’s not physically developed yet. Therefore, in England where the game is very fast and physical here actual ability will not be necessary seen. We’re taking Cian to Spain where he could play with the game much more technical. As you can see from that point of what I can see that Cian is the person of that kind of good player. In England, we are playing very quick. It’s easy to miss him because he gets the ball and he goes very quickly otherwise, some other boys will hit him hard. Where he’s in Spain, it’s a lot more thinking and has a lot more tactical. You can see we have very good young players here. When we came back it was obvious that he was too good for his own age group. So, we started to train him with boys 2-3 years older than him. Obviously, we would concern physically but we knew technically and tactically he would be able to cope. And it proved the best thing we did because from there, his confidence grew, he has to learn wiser and use the ball better and so, his tactical and technical abilities was higher. And at result, we can see Cian now much more confident. So, he plays with his own age group, he has no fear.
Eugene: We have selected, at the moment, we got the older boys about 60 in the academy. Underneath the academy, we run programme to select boys. Here in South London, we got about 200 boys and they travel and we see some we like and we don’t like. So, today you have seen some boys in the IFA’S uniform (Independent Football Academy), those are our boys and you could see some boys who are not in the uniform. Those boys come from all over the places to let us see how we like them or not. Basically, we will look at them and consider for few weeks how we like them.
Eugene: Initially, I was working for Fulham team responded for developing centre or talent centre. Cian came in and be trained at the development centre around 18 months ago. During the time, the boys at Fulham Academy were physically bigger than him. When they are eleven, it can be made a big difference because physically not be able to cope. When they are about 12-13 years old, they will be physically able to hold his own way. So, I first noticed him when we were at Fulham. When I left Fulham team, we decided to resurrect the academy. We invited Cian to come along and be trained here because I believe and feel that there are the clubs there for him and physical size does not matter.
Eugene: Since 1997, we had 78 boys signed for professional football clubs such as Arsenal, WestHam, Chelsea, Fulham, Liverpool, Everton, Bolton, etc. We have 10 professional players. For 13 years, the oldest boy we got, he is 23 years old, so he is quite young.
Eugene: I think he’s very lucky. Cian got parent who are very supportive and at the same time, they keep him level-headed. He continues working very hard, I think that is important thing. He got stable home, so, he could think just football. Also, we are in the city of London where is multicultural and he’s working with boys who are from different background. I think for him is parental and self discipline will get him ability to go through the way and find the right club. amthai

Welcome to our 4th Grade ELA classroom. We will be learning the Arizona State 4th Grade College and Career Standards throughout the school year through nonfiction and fiction text; developing narrative, informational, and functional text; practicing grammar; expanding our vocabulary; and cultivating speaking and listening skills.
My family of 6 moved to the Gilbert area in 1997 from California via Oregon. All four of our sons traversed the hallways of Gilbert Public schools. I have been teaching 4th grade for going on 18 years with a focus of English Language Arts the last three years, and have enjoyed every minute of those years. In my spare time, I love to read, garden, and spend time with my family. I am the proud grandma of 4 grandsons and 2 granddaughters. Two of my sons and their families live in the area, while the other two live in the Seattle, Washington area. My two grandsons that live here in Gilbert, are now traveling through the Gilbert Public schools as a Kindergartner and a second graders here at HPE. In December 2017, I became a National Board Certified teacher in Literacy-Reading and Language Arts. Spring of 2018, I was nominated as HPE's Teacher of the Year, and then became one of three finalists for the Gilbert Public School Teacher of the Year.

I have time to blog now because I am waiting the SPSS software to be finished downloaded. Urgh.... half an hour more. Anyways, the birthdays [...]
I went there for a present for myself. Because Kari has the member card and it's our birthday month so we went there to choose ourselves a present
And blardy hell this was what I got from her. At first I didn't notice there was this card until my brother told me.
it's a permanent rose. i can has it every time i switch on my webcam and show this icon the the webcam
Coincidence or not, they held the class BBQ during my birthday. Intentionally or unintentionally for my birthday celebration, I don't really care. Cause I really had fun wit'em. They have accompanied me for almost 3 years. And our endeavor in UTAR has almost come to an end.
So it's been about a week that I've had my iPhone, and I have absolutely no regrets about getting it. Compared to my 5-year old Sony, on pay-as-you-go, there wasn't much debate to be had.
I thought it interesting that most "web guys", including myself, have to take a second to understand how to go back to the main menu. It's the only button on the phone, but we're all looking for navigation affordances on the screen. This isn't a flaw -- there are a few things like these that feel like a conscious decision to keep the interface simple.
- I'm very slow on the keyboard. My big fingers are always slipping on to the wrong letter. I'm starting to learn the press-and-pause behaviour that lets me quickly switch to the correct letter -- but that's less intuitive than tap-tap-tap. I might have to get a stylus even though it's "so PalmPilot" -- not multitouch sexy
- Speaking of multitouch -- I don't like that I can't zoom with one hand. Standing on the bus is how I do most of my web browsing in the morning, and there is no way to zoom pages with one hand. (Although I've just seen a TV ad that seems to suggest you can by tapping)
- Apple is usually very careful about the start up experience, they've put a few iPhone tutorials on the website -- why aren't those preloaded as videos in the device itself?
- iPod features -- or lack thereof. They really needed to put a small pause/play/fwd/rev device on the cord for the headphones. (Also, not really an issue, but I've gotten some strange looks when I answer a phone call, because it looks like I'm talking to myself while listening to an iPod)
- I won't mention Edge being slow compared to 3G, etc. etc. I've watched YouTube over Edge, so it's not so horrible. And I don't care that it has a low-end camera.
Now, about Apps. I realise that Apple will probably release a lot of Apps very soon. But there are a few no-brainers they could have included that would really come in handy. (Of course I could Jailbreak my iPhone to get them, but I shouldn't have to):
- Native RSS Feed reader - The iPhone was built for catching up on RSS feeds. I rely on Bloglines, but I'd rather have a native iPhone version.
- WPS - Skyhook wireless positioning (as with Loki) -- this gives very accurate positioning (in London at least) and would be a nice feature to be included with Maps.
- Document storage, or at least a PDF sync folder in iTunes. I would like to keep PDF maps and eBooks on my iPhone. Again, I'm sure this is coming, but it already has PDF support in the web browser, so why not allow document storage in iTunes?
- Instant Messenger - again, I'm sure Apple has a version of iChat coming, but I'd really like to keep messenger open on my iPhone. Meebo doesn't seem to work over Edge, and it since it's browser-based, it won't work when the iPhone goes to sleep. But Meebo is a very nice Web app (if you set it up beforehand).
What else could I ask? Well, maybe the next version could be used as a WiiMote too -- now that would be cool.
Parallels will allow you to associate your iPod with iTunes on a virtual PC. This means that if you put that Virtual PC on a portable drive, you can take that iPod and drive anywhere and access your iTunes.
Still not very convenient -- but I bet there is a way (via parallels or bootcamp) to keep a version of Windows on the iPod itself.
But here's where it would be worth offering a bounty to hackers -- what about hacking the iTunes app that runs on the iPhone so that it will recognise the hard drive of whatever machine it's attached to and transfer files to and from that machine?
most everyone else is too lazy to design a website, but if i forgot yours -- please send me your url

As you walk down a path surrounded by impossibly green trees and shrubs, you notice a radiantly blue butterfly gliding through the air in front of your eyes.
You stop in an instant as the butterfly pulls you into a hypnotic gaze. Second by second, the butterfly flaps its wings while shimmering rays of sunshine dance on its wings.
At this moment, nothing else matters. You’re perfectly present and your mind is at ease. Wisps of wind gently massage your cheeks as you feel the warmth of the sun making its way across your body.
Your breath softens. Your heart slows. Peace, joy and tranquility fill your entire being as the butterfly slowly floats behind a tree and out of your line of sight.
Did you temporarily forget about all your worries and notice the perfectly natural and happy state you fell into?
The feeling you felt as you read the short story above is exactly how you’re naturally supposed to feel… all the time… without effort.
Hi, my name is MarBeth Dunn and my job is making people happy. In fact I’ve been given the nickname and title called “The Joy Strategist”.
But before we get into that, I want you to know something. I want you to know that even though I live every day of my life in a state of joy and bliss…
You see, growing up I witnessed shocking amounts of mental and physical abuse from those around me. I internalized all the negative aspects of life I saw and quickly became addicted to victimhood.
I went through life always thinking bad things were going to happen to me, and they did. I was never happy. I hated my life. It brings me to tears just thinking about how unhappy I was back then.
The worst part was, very few people really “knew” how unhappy I was. I buried the emotions, trapping them inside myself like an active volcano about to erupt.
I made a promise to myself that instead of living life as a victim, I was determined to see what I could do about it.
Blended my mastery of energy and consciousness shifting modalities into a unique and highly effective methodology
Not only that, I’ve also spent decades perfecting my skills in showing other people how to be happy by becoming certified in various areas, including…
And if that wasn’t enough, I’ve also studied Qigong with some of the worlds leading experts, plus mastered several advanced energy and consciousness shifting modalities.
Mostly, they want me to help them get over losses in their life or other negative life events which are holding them back from their true magnificent selves, such as…
Dozens of other “hidden losses” such as not living up to your parents standards, not being able to say goodbye to someone before they passed away, gaining weight as you age, and many others!
Uncovering and HEALING the damage caused by these hidden losses in your life is the missing link to true, lasting joy and happiness in your life.
not seem like they’re harming you. However as they build up, they form a cumulative effect and begin to show negative side effects in your life.
Side effects such as mood swings, weight gain, nervousness, anxiety, stress, depression, or simply not feeling satisfied with your life.
Throughout my career, I’ve been showing people how to unblock the negative energy and emotions causing them grief… sadness… victim mentality… and the sense of too much weight on your shoulders… and replace them with emotions of joy, bliss and love.
You see, I love my clients. Watching someone go from depressed and anxious to permanently joyful and free is an amazing experience.
Recently I decided to take all of my experience I’ve built up over the past 25 years and turn it into a step-by-step course which allows you to experience TRUE, lasting joy in your life.
This course is a step-by-step approach designed to help you remove the negative emotions caused by loss in your life and in turn create a joy-filled life.
The kind of life where you wake up each day refreshed, invigorated and excited to go about your day… feeling blissful, relaxed and serene in each moment.
It takes what I’ve learned from over 25 years being a spiritual teacher, 18 years being a facilitator, and 8 years helping my private clients attain lasting joy and happiness in their life… put into an easy to follow course that will take you from where you are now to exactly how you want to think and feel in your daily life.
More specifically, it includes an audio mp3 set segmented into 4 different modules (more on this in a second), plus a workbook to help you get the most benefit out of the program.
How hurts and losses keep you stuck in unproductive patterns which put you down the downward spiral of more pain, more loss, prosperity blocks and anxiety!
How forgiveness releases the past, including negative emotional baggage which is keeping you from reaching your true magnificent self…
Powerful visualizations & exercises to access your heart space, release the past and to forgive others and yourself… clearing the way for joy!
How your perceptual lenses and limiting beliefs hold you back from the joyful life you were meant to live!
Why other people’s negative emotions can be latching onto you, sucking you down with them… and how to release that negative energy to free yourself from others tight holds on you…
Clear your space – Simple techniques to erradicate the old, stale and negative energy… safely and quickly
A detailed explanation of angels and archangels… and how you can borrow their amazing abilities to help guide your life to your fullest potential… (PLUS: Easy techniques for connecting with these “helpers” on a deep level!
My Angel Meditation technique which allows you access to your heart space, and connect you with your angels)… this technique is so powerful I recommend doing it as often as possible!
How to distinguish your two voices (one is for love, one for fear) and use them to your advantage to overcome fears… bring in more love… and enjoy life more!
Simple techniques for “thinking yourself joyful” – These thought-changing techniques are easy, work quickly and dramatically shift your thinking
How To Create your Day for maximized daily joy, happiness and prosperity… this simple exercise has changed the lives of thousands!
How to use appreciation as a strategy to raise your vibration and align with Source energy, develop more insight, and connect with your heart…
This is not your typical joyness book or audio program which gives you general, vague theory which you can’t apply. And it isn’t a single method for overcoming the negatives aspects of your life and turning them into joy.
Instead I’ll show you how to automatically and effortlessly become more joyful on a permanent basis through…
The workbook you’ll receive contains many exercises I’ve personally developed to show you why you already are happy and joyful at your core. They’ll release the negative energy blocking your joy, letting the experience of joy and bliss come forward and finally show themselves!
Breathing correctly is a little-known yet incredibly powerful tool for digging through the mental and emotional clutter holding you back from your potential happiness. These breathing exercises are fun, unique, and work incredibly well.
I’ll guide you through the unique and innovative visualization exercises I’ve been developing and perfecting for the past 25 years. These help push out unwanted energy and attract the positive, joyful energy needed to become happier and more vibrant in your life.
Meditation is one of the most powerful exercises ever discovered by man for becoming happier and more grounded. You’ll be taken through my proprietary meditations to achieve the happiness you’re looking for.
You’ll get access to some of the most powerful and uplifting mantras I’ve ever discovered through working with thousands of private clients. These are time-tested and proven favorites among my clients… and will be for you too!
Declarations send out waves of intent to the universe and allow your intention to effortlessly manifest in your life. I’ll show you the most powerful and fastest working declarations you can use for greater happiness and joy.
One of the reasons my private clients bond with me so well is because I’ve been there. I understand the hurt and torment you’re going through. The sense of impending doom and the weight on your shoulders due to the baggage you’ve been unwillingly carrying through life.
When you begin this program, you’ll actually feel your negative emotions leaving your body as positive, pure love energy fills you as easily and naturally as water filling a glass.
You’ll learn how to move through your “stuff” easily and remove the veils of hurt and pain you’ve been burdened with.
Step out of victimhood and into a place of self-responsibility – Living life this way is the ultimate freedom.
Become a co-creator of abundance in your life – Abundance follows orders. As you begin to learn intention you can begin to “order” abundance to attract to you like a powerful magnet.
Align with Source to become your true, perfect self – At the core, we are all perfect in every way. As you begin to go through the exercises you’ll become closer to “source” (which has many different names) and see how perfect you truly are.
Powerful shift in perceptions and perspectives – One of the most profound experiences my students go through is a shift in the way they think. What they used to be “addicted to” (such as drama), suddenly becomes unbearable. Opportunities for abundance become to come out of nowhere. Chances to increase joy show up unexpectedly. It’s almost as if you’ve started life over with a clean slate!
Experience an easy flow of energy in relationships, abundance career and in time as you enjoy greater authenticity, appreciation, balance, inner guidance, health, love, positive self image, trust, wealth, grace, joy and self esteem.
Remember, at our core we are ALL happy. Have you ever seen the smile of a young child? If you have, you know that that smile is pure joy. That’s the type of joy you can experience too once you release the baggage.
But joy isn’t all you’ll notice shifting in your life. Releasing your negative baggage and filling yourself with pure joy and love will send waves of paradigm shifts to occur through your entire life. You can typically expect to experience…
It’s quite another to actually EXPERIENCE going through this life-changing event and really live it.
Unfortunately, it’s impossible to put into words what it really feels like. It’s like having a baby for the first time or getting married. It’s simply impossible to describe your emotions and experience until you actually go through it.
“I was always a pretty happy person, but had some negative baggage I could feel weighing me down. I was more tired than I should be… gaining weight because of emotional eating… and started becoming unproductive in work.
As I began doing the exercises, I noticed a heavy feeling in my stomach and chest, which is where I tend to hold my emotions. The feeling got heavier and heavier, as if the negative emotions had actual weight to them.
All of that pressure and baggage instantly vanished and my body felt as light as a feather. I’m not exaggerating. I literally felt as if I weighed almost nothing… and a smile came over me so big and broad you could fit a truck through it. For the next 20 minutes or so, I literally couldn’t stop smiling. It was the single best experience I’ve ever had in my life.
Since then, that feeling has stayed with me. I regularly get an overwhelming feeling of love and joy as I’m out in nature. My business quadrupled that year and has continued growing ever since. I recently moved into the house of my dreams. And the best part is… I’m nearly always happy. Even when things go bad I’ve discovered how to feel negative for a short amount of time and quickly become happy again, at will.
The funny part is, I only “half” believed in this energy stuff until I actually went through it and experienced it for myself!
If you could make your negative emotions simply vanish by overcoming and accepting loss in your life, and live every day filled with joy… abundance… happiness and attracting nearly anything you want in life…
This course is filled with powerful information which I’ve tweaked and tested over the past 25 years to finally put together what I believe to be the perfect step-by-step system for overcoming your negative baggage and living a life filled with joy.
And while I know the actual “value” of living a joy-filled life can be put into the millions, I obviously could never ask you to invest that much.

Edwin Ospino, 22, gunman caught on social media allegedly firing a semi-automatic pistol in the air in a Heights-area neighborhood maintained his innocence outside a Harris County courtroom. Sotos shooting was recorded on Snapchat near Cottage Grove Park on Nov. 20 around 10:15 p.m.
Edwin Ospino, 22, gunman caught on social media allegedly firing a semi-automatic pistol in the air in a Heights-area neighborhood maintained his innocence outside a Harris County courtroom. Sotos shooting
A 23-year-old Missouri City man who used Snapchat to film himself firing a pistol in a Houston neighborhood will spend five years on probation after pleading guilty to deadly conduct on Friday, court records show.
Edwin Alexander Ospino has been in the Harris County jail since May when his bond was revoked for curfew violations and testing positive for drugs, records show. He was also on probation for a charge of resisting arrest in 2016.
A Snapchat clip of Ospino firing a semi-automatic weapon into the air in the Heights-area Cottage Grove Park neighborhood around 10:15 p.m. on Nov. 20 went viral with Houston news stations airing the short clip. After authorities saw it, the Houston Police Department filed charges of deadly conduct, alleging that he acted with disregard for the people in the nearby houses. Ospino was arrested days later when CrimeStoppers of Houston offered a $5,000 reward.
When he arrived at the Harris County Courthouse for his arraignment in late November, Ospino refused to answer questions from reporters choosing instead to try to build a following for his aspiring music career and sell t-shirts with his Snapchat handle on it.
He arrived with his 20-year-old brother, who was wearing a t-shirt with Ospino’s Snapchat handle written across the front. On the social media platform, he encouraged followers to use the hashtag #ShapchatShooter and offered to sell the T-shirts.
After appearing before state District Judge George Powell, Ospino walked away from several television cameras and opened the Snapchat app on his phone to record a message to his followers. He told them not to believe what they had heard about his case.
If he violates his probation, he faces the possibility of 10 years in prison for the third-degree felony. In court records for his other cases, Ospino is also listed as Edwin Alexander Ospino-Soto and Edwin Soto Ospino.

KairosPDX is a non-profit organization focused on delivering excellent, equitable education to underserved children, their families and their communities. Through innovative pedagogy, community collaboration and family partnership we are closing Portland’s persistent achievement gap in measurable, sustainable ways. Our mission is to eliminate the prolific racial achievement and opportunity gaps by cultivating confident, creative, compassionate, leaders who exceed expectations at each milestone ages 0-10. We do this through a three-pronged approach that includes:
We cannot begin to make meaningful and lasting change in our education system unless all voices are lifted, unless the table is set with not just the usual subjects, but the unusual…unless we get to the root of inequity and weed it out.
We want to bring the voices to the table who are systemically left out. We want to change the tide of the achievement gap that continues to deny access to opportunity to thousands of youth. Opportunity that generations of people fought for…died for. We can do better.
*Kairos: “an ancient Greek word meaning the right or opportune moment (the supreme moment); a moment of indeterminate time in which something special happens.”
On May 24th, 2018, in partnership with Chalkboard Project, we discussed measurable and sustainable ways to dismantle the inequities in education that allow the achievement gap to persist. Click here to watch the event recording.
On Friday, August 4th, we celebrated our 5th birthday here at KairosPDX! We had the pleasure of celebrating this big day with many families, and community members including Commissioner Loretta Smith, Roger Hinshaw from Bank of America, and Mike Rosen of the Portland School Board.
Our Executive Director, Kali Thorne Ladd, wrote an article with Ron Herndon of Albina Head Start featured in the Portland Observer titled “Well Intended but with Devastating Consequences: Pre-school promise risks isolating kids of color.” Additionally, KairosPDX is referenced and Kali is quoted in another article titled, “Preschool Promise Adverse to Albina Head Start: New requirements fail kids of color, advocates say.”
We are excited to move to PPS’ Humboldt School Building located at 4915 N. Gantenbein Avenue, Portland, OR 97217. We will move on Wednesday, June 29th starting at 8am. If you are available and interested in helping us pack or unpack in the days before or as we settle into our new space in July, please contact Lauren via email, volunteer@kairospdx.org, to sign up for a shift.
On Friday, May 29th 2015, KairosPDX presented the culminating celebration, showcasing teachers’ learning from our Community of Resistance Workshop Series. There were learnings from teachers committed to the transformative work creating inclusive classrooms for all children.
TEDxPortland is a one day experience of inspiration with thinkers and doers including: 14 live talks, 4 TED.com talks, 3 performances, happy hour, and post-event party.
Thank you for coming out and showing your support during the Board Meeting when our K-5 Learning Academy was approved with a unanimous vote by the Portland Public School District.
I just checked and I have 54 followers! I hope to continue to learn from all of the wonderful teacher out there in blogland! Thank you for following me...I hope to inspire others as you all have inspired me!
I meant to post this sooner...but the 4th of July holiday caused all sorts of craziness. Now, this week, I'm off to Las Vegas for the I Teach K conference! So excited that I cannot sleep!!

What Is MLM Marketing MLM Prospecting System | MLM Company List In United States What Is Multi Level Marketing
Many of the beautiful sites offered no type of ongoing training, and that was something that really needs to be be a part of any good MLM leads programs. There were some that had online training, as well as cds and training series you could purchase. That was good, but the ongoing live training was the best idea, and we found many MLM leads Companies that did just that.
8. Direct-mail lists and fax and e-mail broadcast lists. There are many mailing list companies with databases that target specific interests. Creating a good letter offering a free tape or product sample can generate leads. Always drive them to your Web site. Get to your prospects even faster by broadcast faxing or e-mail blasting. There are professional companies that can help you with this.
This is the age old question for all businesses, how do I generate prospects to make sales to. There are hundreds of methods, but as I have learned over the years, what worked yesterday does not mean it will work today, never mind tomorrow or next year. List building, lead purchases, your social media posting, advertising, email marketing, texting, Bluetooth wireless broadcasting, there are many strategies and they all depend on your market focus. What will work for one will not work for another, so you have to focus on those who would be interested in your product or service first and foremost.
So if you are interested in Australian business opportunity leads, just sort them by country and contact members interested in your opportunity (see screen shot below). To avoid random spam invites, the platform uses a smart point system to regulate engagement. l will discus, how you can earn free points and how you can use them to reach out to prospects.
A constant and steady lead flow in your Network Marketing business is vital to being successful. Not everyone is comfortable talking to friends and family or feel they have burnt them out. I have found that most of the times this is NOT the actual case but when getting started, you need to seek out numerous, reliable sources to create a steady lead flow. Buying MLM leads is one way to create instant lead flow, and also compliment other lead generation sources.
You have to determine the level of ability to do this in your area but one great way how to generate MLM leads is through either bandit signs or sticky notes. Bandit signs are those colorful outdoor signs you see along the highway or busy intersections. There is a training available here – How to market with cheap bandit signs. One thing you will want to do, as taught in the training, is use a qualifying sign as you can get too many calls if you make it too simplistic. This same exact approach taught can be done with little sticky notes that you put up around town to get more MLM leads.

If you're looking for people who are interested in home based business opportunities, we have that information available for you.
The odds in MLM are dismal overall which makes me all the more impressed when someone does well. 95 out of a hundred people in direct sales fail in their home-based business and 90% of all new distributors never make a list of people to contact about their business. So your odds aren’t great. Probably because everyone is self-taught or trying to figure it out on their own with limited sales ability or experience.
Once you are ready to buy leads, understanding which lead product is best for you is the next step. Are you interested in calling leads when their interest is at their highest? Then you will want to purchase Real time leads. Are you just getting started and want to get a lot of practice and build your list with a lesser investment? Then, the discounted, aged leads may be better. Test them out and see what works best for you.

I want to start off with saying great video above and the information is very thorough. I will be following your advice and guidance to get my new business going. I am very new to the Network Marketing industry but have been introduced to a new Tech Company (called VIV) that has a phenomenal, once in a lifetime opportunity to get into their Founders Circle.

Twitter offers a more automated means of lead capture. With a target web site, either your own or the ‘offer’ money site, you are in a position to write short articles or blogs and then post Tweets carrying links to these articles. Keep those down to about 10% of the total, linking the other 90% to interesting on-topic snippets elsewhere on the web. Then use a good scheduler to queue a week or two’s Tweets and then let it run on auto pilot.
Write about your knowhow on your website, e-newsletters, and your business blog. Also known as “inbound marketing”, this strategy brings the customers to you through offering them valuable content to support their own activities. If you are a doctor specialist, have short articles written about how you normally would deal with certain problems in your specialty. If you are a lawyer, explain the main laws that affect your clients’ types of cases. Whatever you are, remember that you have valuable information to share and that by sharing it on a regular basis, you are attracting more and more prospects to you while becoming a thought leader in the industry!
Every time you click on an ad on Facebook, Facebook is making money on that ad, and a business is running it because they need web traffic. So Facebook, is essentially selling targeted web traffic. Google does the same thing. At the top of every Google search, there are typically 2 to 3 ads, and on the right side, there maybe as many as eight. Thus Google is selling traffic. Same for Bing and Yahoo. This results in millions of dollars income for these companies. Click the link at the bottom of the page to learn more about the truth of how Google and Facebook really make their money.

Networking, as it used to be called, is a pretty thankless task. The conventional approach to networking was to start with the network of friends and colleagues that you already have; friends and family, your existing clients, your contacts at the squash club and so on. Most people feel uncomfortable pitching to friends and family, unless you have an unbeatable idea or concept, but if that was the case, then lead generation would not be a problem
Business Opportunity Leads typically come from people who are either seeking to find a new business opportunity or those who are interested in creating a business opportunity. It is not uncommon for business opportunity leads to involve investors or those who have access to stock or funds that they would like to direct towards a more purposeful cause. Leads may also come from new businesses that are seeking to offer opportunities to prospective clients.
I have had a lot of people ask me about buying opportunity leads so I decided to team up with Responsive Data that is the top supplier of real time leads in our industry. Their services are used by people like Ray and Ferny, Todd Falcone, Ted Nuyten and more. If you are serious about buying leads or want to get better on the phone, visit my brand new page where you can buy leads today – Business Opportunity Leads Store
Once you’ve made your connections, presented your opportunity, validated you and your company, ask for the sale! So many opportunities are missed simply because a person was too busy connecting and chatting, instead of asking for the business. You are looking for serious people to join and become a part of your team, don’t forget to ask. The experience and hands on training you get by just getting on the phone and making calls, is priceless. The more you are calling leads, the better you will become.
Our goal is to provide you with the best possible tools to build your network marketing business.

I just got back from one of my Recruiting Retreats, where I literally lock people in a house for three days and build their businesses with them. One of the things we talked about was working leads...and in fact, we spent a fair bit of time actually having the people in the house dial leads. Most of them had never called leads before...so it was a test for them, a stretch outside of their comfort zone, and a great way to learn.
Our training: We offer live dials training calls weekly. We actually call our own leads and prospect like were a distributor looking for new reps. We usually have hundreds of people on our conference call, they are muted and are able to listen as we discuss the various options with the prospect. Every one of these calls are slightly different and after every time there is a call made we do an analysis of the response and break down the elements of the call. This is what training is about! Imagine listening to this live this is not theory but it’s real training. The best of all, these calls are absolutely free to our customers and our future customers.
Internet marketing lead generation is without doubt the best way for you to attract the most prospects possible to your business. The tricky part is how to effectively use network marketing lead generation without wasting a lot of time. You could spend hours just spinning your wheels online and not acquire near enough leads to justify the time. We’d like to share a few of our short- and long-term strategies for how to effectively make your business boom through network marketing lead generation.
As a last resort, you could try cold calling by phone. This is probably the most depressing and soul destroying activity on the planet. Even if you get past the usual questions such as ‘If you’re selling something – I’m not interested’ and ‘How did you get my number?’ you need a really slick and professional script and the ability to recognize and avoid lonely old ladies who just want to interact with someone, anyone, in fact.
One of my favorite approaches to get my pipeline going is attend a bunch of meetups or local events in my area. I teach what I do on this blog – How to network at events. I love this approach as only people who want something MORE in their life will bother attending events and that is a lot easier type of person to talk to than someone who is NOT motivated to network or build their business.

At the other end of the spectrum is buying leads. This is also not the best option since it can be very expensive and may result in leads that may not actually be interested in your products or business. These are not great leads, either. The best leads will always be the ones you generate yourself—people who have shown some sort of interest in what you have to offer.
Many competitors will seek to confuse you with a range of leads that is just way too wide and complex. It’s like trying to compare apples with oranges and is designed simply to confuse you.

Both types of home business opportunity or bizop leads are fully guaranteed so all the risk is on us.

Don’t let our low prices fool you. Just because we wanted to offer reasonable prices to our customers doesn’t mean our List of Leads doesn’t contain anything other than the highest quality leads.

Build an email list. There is a system for working with leads. The first step is getting them to be aware of and take an interest in what you have—by visiting your website, for example. The next best step is to ask your leads to sign up for your email list. You can get them to sign up by offering something for free, such as a report or something useful, from your website. For instance, if you're selling wellness products, then you might offer a guide to good-for-you ingredients or recipes. This will allow you to communicate with your prospects and provide valuable information related to your business and the general field that it's in, such as special sales, events, news, and research—and stay top-of-mind to your past, current, and possible future customers. Just be sure that you're following the laws and regulations regarding email marketing.
October 2, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – Life Chain is an annual event which consists of thousands of pro-life women, men and children standing on over 200 street corners across Canada holding signs that read, “Abortion Hurts Women”, “Abortion Kills Children,” “Adoption, the Loving Option”, "Life, We Stand On Guard For Thee", and “Pregnant and need help? Call (local pregnancy help centre phone number)”. This is an explicitly peaceful and silent protest. Participants are not allowed to begin conversations with passersby, nor are they allowed to display any aggressive behaviour at any point. No abortion victim photography is permitted. My task for this year's Life Chain, which took place on Sunday, 30 September, was to manage the corner of Bloor and Keele, to hand out signs, and to take a headcount. Seventy-six sign-holders were present on that corner from 2:00-3:00 pm. One pro-abortion woman, probably in her late twenties, stood amongst us holding a sign that read, “My body, my choice, my right”. She was the only counter-protester present throughout, and she peacefully shared the corner with the rest of us. At around 2:30, I was assaulted. Image Marie-Claire Bissonnette A man in his late twenties to early thirties observed the demonstration and, taking out two markers, one red and one blue, he managed to deface two of our signs. After I warned people to shield their signs, he then proceeded to run up behind five of the participants (including a ten-year-old girl) and scribble with his markers on their backs, ruining their clothing. After these acts of vandalism, he approached the pro-abortion demonstrator, evidently in order to seek her approval, which she appeared to deny him by discouraging his tactics. At this point I took out my cell phone and began to record him, telling him that what he did was destruction of private property and it was against the law. He asked me whether a sixteen-year-old girl who gets pregnant after being raped should keep her baby. I attempted to explain that her baby should be treated no differently than a three-year-old child who may have been conceived by rape. He then forcefully roundhouse-kicked me in the shoulder, which sent my phone flying and I yelled for someone to call the police. In defence of his violence he claimed he’d meant to kick my phone, and then, as a fellow Life Chain participant dialed 9-1-1, he yanked off the ribbon I’d been wearing on my chest and ran away, heading east on Bloor. A police car arrived, five to ten minutes later. The policemen rolled down their window but did not exit their vehicle. I approached them and told them I was just assaulted and explained the situation. I showed them the video. They replied, “What do you want us to do about it?”. As I was on the verge of tears and shaking from the adrenaline, I didn’t know what to say. I asked what my options were, and they replied that I could file a complaint, but warned that I’d have to take him to court, and only if they were able to find him, but given that it wasn’t a "serious case of assault", he’d be likely to be given probation or less. Image Marie-Claire Bissonnette's attacker defending abortion in cases of rape, moments before the attack, Toronto, Sept. 30, 2018. I asked if I could file a complaint without going to court and they said no. My main concern at the time was that the incident was on file. The officers said the phone call would be on record, but their apparent indifference discouraged me from pursuing the issue further so I told them I would not. Two hours later, I started to feel pain in my shoulder where I’d been kicked and I contacted the police and filed a report with a different set of officers who were significantly more helpful, even offering a trauma support group after they visited my house and saw me still shaking with eyes red from crying. The police are still looking for my attacker and he has yet to be identified. This sort of assault is neither a single nor a rare occurrence. Image The attacker kicking Marie-Claire Bissonnette in the shoulder, knocking her phone from her hand, Toronto, Sept. 30, 2018. Elsewhere on the same day, a man was standing and silently praying at the corner of Confederation and the Queensway in Mississauga when a woman approached him from behind and poured paint all over his jacket and pants. He was oblivious to what was happening until he felt the liquid and turned around to see the woman grinning at him. He told me: “These people are more and more aggressive because they have the support from the government and the media”. In 2014 Michael Panagapko of Toronto was convicted of assaulting a woman during the 2013 Life Chain with a knife. He poured water on her, threw the bottle in her face, pulled her to the ground by her hair and beat her by punching and kicking her, before pulling out his knife. Youtube is full of documented evidence of violent attacks on peaceful pro-lifers.

Krav maga groin strikes are one of the most common form of self defense you learn when you begin taking krav maga lessons. Obviously, if you are kicking a man in the groin, this self defense technique will work. In this video clip you will see how a woman defends herself from an attacker at an airpot. Pay particular attention at how she follows through with a kick right to the groin area. Once the guy is on his knees, she finishes the job by hitting him with a couple of blows (including elbow strikes) to the face. Once the guy has been neutralized, she then flees the situation. Way to go girl. Here is the link to this video in case you want to share it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7dVu5IkxHM Here is a link to another one of our videos on self defense.

“The thrum of the heavy, pulsing downbeat, an affect to which I am susceptible, began to feel to me as I imagine a hit of heroin feels to an addict: calming, insistent, essential, and ultimately insufficient.”
n the morning after the first ever in Mets’ history no hitter, my friend Levenberg and I had this brief Facebook “conversation”:
Me: There you go. In fact, between Ike and being reminded of JQ it must have been a pretty tough night.
We: agreed, with his fragmented distillation hovering in the air, that there was more to say about agony, memory, ecstasy, and now. Post-game analysis is everything.
Let me start by making it clear that agony and ecstasy are in opposition but not exclusive of each other. And the same can be said, I suppose, for memory and now. In fact, these things are interdependent: without the agony of memory, the ecstasy of now means nothing.
To what extent do you live in the past, present, future? I want numbers, percentages. Feel free, even encouraged, to go above and beyond 100 percent, consciousness not being a zero-sum game.
Or, if you think it is, then I suggest you design your personal schema around achieving balance and symbiosis among the various temporalities. A dash of rehash, a pinch of fantasy, mix well with a generous dose of this is your life.
The present, whether agonistic or ecstatic, has no context or meaning without both a sense of the future, even if it’s just a best guess, and the presence, so to speak, of the past. Yes, you can be in two psychic places (or more!) at once. I’ve been making this present-and-not-present case to Skeptic for years, albeit to little avail.
Yesterday, from the time SchoolLess left the house just after 9 AM to meet my parents at Penn Station for his bar mitzvah trip to D.C. until SmallerMan arrived home from school a few minutes before 4 PM, I listened to “Blackout” by Steve Wynn. I didn’t feel comfortable leaving the house to pick up groceries and a cup of coffee until I’d downloaded a copy to my phone.
Even after over a hundred listens, I can’t say for sure what the song means, but I certainly felt an attachment to its ephemeral sense of post-tragedy hopefulness. These are the two lines that most resonated as the day wore repetitiously on:
The song put me in a mood. The thrum of the heavy, pulsing, downbeat, an affect to which I am susceptible, began to feel to me as I imagine a hit of heroin feels to an addict: calming, insistent, essential, and ultimately insufficient. An hour in, I was dancing like Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs, dream-like, easing into true self, not a sadistic cop torturer, but, rather, a man on the verge of a creative endeavor. I fantasized game winning catches, nailing an appearance on Colbert, smashing light fixtures. At some point in the early afternoon, when I was about halfway through my obsessive-compulsive marathon, reality set in. I had the munchies, the shakes. My writing window had narrowed to almost nothing, obligations loomed: another day down.
A few weeks ago Skeptic came home to find me cooking dinner with music blasting. The boys were doing homework, chopping garlic and onions, shooting baskets in the backyard, I’m hazy on the details. We were “alone together” is the point, though in this case not left so much to our own devices as our own minds.
Skeptic turned the music down, as is her wont (sensory issues). “It’s as if you’re trying to escape from your life,” she said.
I, as is my wont, went straight for the knee-jerk denial: “I’m not. I just like loud music.” But of course she was not totally wrong. Music, louder better, is an escape, but—and this is important—so what?
During an inadvertent lapse in my lyrical looping, a podcast on plot by the writer Charlie Baxter inexplicably began playing from the Sonos queue. With the volume high, the soft-spoken Baxter sounded vaguely god-like, simultaneously more and less himself.
Baxter was something of a mentor to me in grad school, though I wasn’t yet ready for proper mentoring and he and I were, perhaps because too alike in personality, an imperfectly perfect pair. I feel pulled toward not only his work—I read and teach his stories and essays regularly—but the man himself. I would like to know him now, again and better.
I don’t listen to the lecture for long—I’ve heard it all before—but do get as far as Baxter’s thoughts on characters becoming undone and the causes of their undoings. He notes that we do not talk about a person, real or imagined, becoming done. Negation is the only option.
This is true in other semantic realms as well. We can be inept but not ept, nonplussed but not plussed. I am never, despite my better efforts, gruntled. The ungainly may grow out of awkwardness but they will never be gainly.
One of Baxter’s points, as I recall from the time when I did listen to the entire lecture, was that Americans don’t believe in consequences or tragedy, which suggests a constant and inevitable state of irony, whether one knows it or not. In America, consequences are learning opportunities and tragedies are but subtexts of heroic moments.
My students struggle to understand irony. They see it as being about opposite, despite my stated preference for the more varietal and inclusive, if confusing, incongruous.
My world, more than theirs I suppose, is not just full of these incongruities it is inherently incongruous. Is it that I am paying more attention than they are or am I just twisted?
A student wrote a paper in my Carver class called “The Irony of Faith.” I loved the title, but the concept remained regrettably unpacked. Another student, a Serb (his ethnicity seems significant to me, I’m not sure why), confused irony with sarcasm (best case) or epiphany (worst). “It’s when I say to you, ‘You are a terrible professor.’”
Irony can be crutch or a club. And even within that metaphoric dichotomy, there is variation based on intention and design.
How do you respond to the presence of irony? Are you alarmed? Startled? Sick and tired? Threatened? Inexplicably drawn toward? Detached? Comforted? Confused? Does it make you want to laugh? To cry? Does it make you angry?
I stopped by Levenberg’s office yesterday and we talked story and character, the lives of both people we know and those we hope some day to write into existence. We exchanged crazy parent stories. We remarked on how often folks—it seems like an epidemic—persistently lie, to themselves and others, about their own lives.
Even while he was still doubting whether the Penn Station meet-up would be anything less than a disaster, my father was already worrying about how SchoolLess would get himself home to Brooklyn if the return train, due in Penn Station on Friday evening at 6:39, did not arrive until, say, 2:30 in the morning, because “with Amtrak you never know.”
He’s right-ish, of course, about never really knowing what the future holds. Tree limbs fall. Lightening strikes. People fall asleep and never wake up. That knock at your door is probably the Chinese food deliveryman but—hey, it’s possible—it could be the Nazis come to finish the job. Or maybe there is a God.
Research seems to suggest that it’s better to be an optimist than a pessimist but I’m not totally convinced. And, really, how much control do we have over where we fall on this spectrum anyway?
Among the various incarnations of optimism, there’s the standard “anticipatory” type, with which I have no beef, and then the increasingly common “retrospective,” with which I do, perhaps to my disadvantage . The former is defined by hope and possibility. The latter is nothing but false truth, aka:
I have been thinking about writing—which is to say, but not—a short story called “The Music School” about a man some years older than I am whose two boys are the same some years older than mine are now. Get it? His boys, in the hysterical nomenclature of the over-attached modern parent (I know you because I am you), are “gone forever.”
For years he had accompanied them to the school, spending numerous hours either observing lessons and rehearsals or waiting for them to end. At a table in the lobby he would read, eavesdrop, kibitz, snack, and contemplate life; it is to these pastimes that, older, lonelier, and without the currency of children in his charge, he has returned. His life is in shambles, I don’t yet know the details, and he has been drawn back to this place of comforting memory.
Surrounded by nannies, parents, and unruly children, he imagines the daughter he never had. I’ll call her Ruthie, after my late grandmother. She’s a cellist, perhaps, a kick-ass point guard, beautiful more than pretty, seriously smart and seriously funny. The girl is a miracle, but, alas, only a figment of an imagination.
Levenberg ended his post—read him, he’s good—with some words about perfectibility, beauty, order, and this lie: “all things are possible.” Patently untrue, as any sane man knows.

Mercury will soon officially turned direct, meaning it will begin to move forward again through the zodiac. As with many other astrological phenomena, astrologers disagree about how long the “shadow” period of the retrograde is, and when it is safe to emerge again from the shadows and begin making decisions and taking new steps.
In my view and experience, as long as Mercury is moving slowly as it does just before and just after the retrograde turn its effect on communication and frustrating events remains strong. As Mercury begins to pick up speed there is more of an ease of motion that helps to lubricate both verbal communication and the transmission of energy in general.
The sign that Mercury is in and the aspects that it makes to other planets have a great deal to do with the effect of the retrograde period. Mercury is in Sagittarius now where it tends to instill a broader vision that can be particularly frustrated by the retrograde, and the fact that Jupiter and Uranus are approaching their final conjunction in Pisces is creating surprising changes and turns of events. This conjunction of Jupiter to Uranus breaks apart our preconceptions and requires that we release the past in order to move forward into a new breakthrough of awareness and experience.
Mercury will not begin to pick up speed until after the Capricorn New Moon on January 4th. A New Moon in Capricorn, the sign of achievement, is a wonderful time to set intentions for success in business or other practical matters. At that time Mercury will be in range of a challenging square to Jupiter and Uranus which may make it difficult to concentrate, but it could also encouraging the breaking […]
Mercury is still retrograde for another few days or so, and there are signs of it everywhere. Mercury rules transportation as well as communication, and when retrograde there are often snafus and the need to repair our equipment and revise our plans
I’m sure my readers have stories of their own to tell: disappearing emails, dropped phone calls, malfunctioning equipment, miscommunications. There are plenty of stories in the news as well that relate to the retrograde Mercury cycle (italicized words are Mercury keywords)
Passengers are stranded in airports all over the world from Boston to London to Moscow as winter storms bring air travel to a screeching halt.
Miscommunications between airline pilots and air traffic controllers resulted in passengers on Cathay Pacific and British Airways planes being without an available gate for many hours.
The Chinese government delivered a to Pope Benedict’s criticism of Chinese religious freedoms in his Christmas message. It seems to me this is an area in which the Pope doesn’t have much room to criticize.
Time Warner Cable makes another grab for more programming money by rejecting a settlement offer with Sinclair Broadcasting which means Sinclair channels, including network and Fox affiliates, will go dark when the contract expires.
If you liked 2010, you’ll love 2011! While likely not as personally challenging as the past two years, the astrology of 2011 brings its’ own excitement.
To learn more what’s coming up next year, here is a link to an .mp3 of the radio show I did on the subject. The recording is just of the lecture portion and does not include the call-in section.
Anyone who has read this blog for more than five minutes will know that I am rather skeptical not only of Christianity but of any organized religion. Religion is found in astrological symbolism in the planet Jupiter, which seeks to define a belief system which helps to give our life meaning. When this individual theology is shared among others, religion is the result. Neptune is the planet that bestows an actual experience of the divine – a direct connection to God that requires no intermediary. Shared belief systems are important in order to connect with others. My closest friends are the ones who share my belief systems and my view of the world. But my view of the world is something that is my own, rather than something that has been indoctrinated.
Still, I love the Christmas season, with its pagan-derived trappings of pine trees decorated with colorful balls and lights, songs of celebration, and the sharing of food and sweets with family and friends. After all, the week of the Winter Solstice has been celebrated as Yule. And even if it’s only for a week, it’s lovely to hear people of all religions talk about peace on earth and goodwill to men.
Around this time people always ask about the astrological meaning of the Star of Bethlehem, and a recent MSNBC article presents a compelling case for the actual birthdate of Jesus based upon the astronomical Star of Bethlehem:
Historical records and modern-day computer simulations indicate that there was a rare series of planetary groupings, also known as conjunctions, during the years 3 B.C. and 2 B.C.
While I’m thrilled that astrology is spreading like wildfire on the internet, I am less thrilled at the fear that is sometimes generated, both by astrologers and by readers themselves.
I’m really nervous. Can’t find my CD of our reading to check if this is a day I should stay in bed:)
Lynn: I’m sorry that I am just responding to your email and the eclipse happened last night. The reason that site said this about Virgos is because the lunar eclipse was in a square aspect to your Sun. But more important for your chart, it also made a very tight square to your Moon. This suggests that this period may be catalyzing some big emotional shifts for you – if so, it’s a good time to breathe deeply and let go so that the transformation can occur. If we stay in bed, metaphorically or literally, we miss the opportunity to unfold in a new way.
Despite the fear tactics that some astrologers use, I have not seen instances where eclipses lead to tragic events. They are general internal forces that create change.
Please don’t let astrology scare you! It should be a tool to bring wisdom into our lives, and where there is wisdom fear disappears.

When Mercury is retrograde we often see communication and equipment snafus, and things not going according to plan. There is a "shadow" period lasting about a week on either side when Mercury's movement is slower than normal. These are excellent times for planning and reflection but not good times to begin something new.

The blog will be taking a short powder due to software difficulties...Evidently, all the wireless technology in the world and good upgrading habits can't save me from an operating system upgrade that absolutely, positively HAS to be downloaded via blah blah blah. Yawn. It bores me to type it, so I imagine it would bore you to read it.
A lot of ground gets covered on this blog -- from sailboat racing to book suggestions to plain old piffle.
For the past few weeks we have been discussing the problem of self-awareness and self-knowledge. It is so obviously essential to know oneself completely. And to know oneself, is not a withdrawal from life, but rather, the understanding of relationship - relationship with things, with people, with ideas. And, experience can be understood only through self-knowledge; experience is not apart from self-knowledge.
Unfortunately, most of us do not seek self-knowledge, but cling to experience. And we use experience as a measure to discover truth, to discover reality, or God, or what you will. So experience, with most of us, has become the standard of valuation.
But does experience reveal truth, or whatever name you like to call it? Surely, experience is a distraction, a process away from oneself. That is, most of us are so unaware of the total process of our existence; we do not see that we are running away from ourselves. In ourselves, whether we admit it or not, consciously or unconsciously, there is a state of poverty, an emptiness, which we try to cover up, from which we try to run away. And in the process of covering it up, we have various experiences; we cling to various points of view, beliefs. And these distractions, which are obviously away from ourselves, are experiences. That is, one is aware, consciously or unconsciously, of a sense of emptiness in oneself, a sense of being nothing a sense of being insufficient. Most of us are aware of it; but we are not willing to face it, not willing to understand what it is; we try to run away from that state of emptiness, that state of nothingness, either through holding on to property, through name, through position or family, through people, or through knowledge. This flight from ourselves is called experience; and, to these escapes we cling, and therefore the means of escape become much more important than the understanding of ourselves. The means of escape from our` own state offer happiness, and therefore experience becomes a hindrance to the understanding of what is.
That is, to put it differently, most of us are aware that we are lonely; and to escape from that loneliness, we turn on the radio, or read a book, or cling to a person, or become addicted to knowledge. This escape from what is, gives us various experiences; and to these experiences we cling. Then property, name, position, prestige, become extraordinarily important. Similarly, the person becomes important, whether the one or the many, the individual or the group, the society. And likewise knowledge, as a means of escape from ourselves, becomes extraordinarily important.
So, we cover up that emptiness, that loneliness, through knowledge, through relationship, and through possessions; therefore, possessions, relationships, and knowledge become extraordinarily important - because without them we should be lost. Without them we are face to face with ourselves as we are, and to escape from that, we resort to all these means, and are caught in the experiences of these escapes. We use those experiences as a standard, as a measure, to discover reality. But reality, or God, is the unknown; it cannot be measured by our experience, by our conditioning; and to come to it, we must put aside all escapes and face what is - which is our loneliness, our extraordinary sense of being nothing. Because we are empty, though we do not like to acknowledge it; and we have therefore surrounded ourselves with things through which we escape from ourselves.
So, experience is not a measure, is not the way to reality; because, after all, we experience according to our belief, according to our conditioning; and that belief is obviously an escape from ourselves. To know myself, I need not have any belief: I only have to watch myself, clearly and choicelessly - watch myself in relationship, watch myself in escape, watch myself in attachment. And one has to watch oneself without any prejudice, without any conclusion, without any determination. In that passive awareness, one discovers this extraordinary sense of aloneness. I am sure most of you have felt this - the sense of complete emptiness which nothing can fill. It is only in abiding in that state, when all values have utterly ceased; it is only when we are capable of being alone and facing that aloneness without any sense of escape - only then does reality come into being. Because, values are merely the result of our conditioning; like experience, they are based on a belief, and are a hindrance to the understanding of reality.
But, that is an arduous task, which most of us are unwilling to go through. So we cling to experiences - mystical, superstitious, the experiences of relationship, of so-called love, and the experiences of possession. These become very significant, because it is of these that we are made. We are made of beliefs, of conditioning's. of environmental influences: that is our background. And from that background, we judge, we value. And when one goes through, understands, the whole process of this background, then one comes to a point where one is utterly alone. One must be alone to find reality - which does not mean escape, withdrawal from life. On the contrary it is the complete intensification of life; because, then there is freedom from the background, from the memory of the experiences of escape. In that aloneness, in that loneliness, there is no choice, there is no fear of what is. Fear arises only when we are unwilling to acknowledge or see what is.
Therefore, it is essential for reality to come into being, to set aside the innumerable escapes that one has established, in which one is caught up. After all, if you observe, you will see how we use people - how we use our husbands and wives, or groups, or nationalities - to escape from ourselves. We seek comfort in relationship. Such a search for comfort in relationship brings certain experiences and to those experiences we cling. Also, to escape from ourselves, knowledge becomes extraordinarily important; but knowledge is obviously not the way to reality. Mind must be completely empty and still, for reality to come into being. But a mind that is rattling around with knowledge, addicted to ideas and beliefs, ever chattering, is incapable of receiving that which is. Similarly, if we seek comfort in relationship, then relationship is an avoidance of ourselves. After all, in relationship we want comfort, we want something to lean on, we want support, we want to be loved, we want to be possessed - which all indicates the poverty of our own being. Similarly our desire for property, for name, for titles, for possessions, indicates that inward insufficiency.
When one realizes that this is not the way to reality, then one comes to that state when the mind is no longer seeking comfort, when the mind is completely content with what is - which does not mean stagnation. In the flight from what is, there is death; in the recognition and awareness of what is, there is life. So, experience based on conditioning, the experience of a belief, which is the result of escape from ourselves, and the experience of relationship - these become a hindrance, a block; they cover up our insufficiencies. And it is only when we recognise that these things are an escape, and therefore see their true value - only then is there a possibility of remaining quiet, still, in that emptiness, in that loneliness. And when the mind is very quiet, neither accepting nor rejecting, being passively aware of that which is - then there is a possibility for that immeasurable reality to be.
Question: Is there, or is there not, a Divine Plan? What is the sense of our striving if there is not one?
Krishnamurti: Why do we strive? And what are we striving after? What would happen if we did not strive? Would we stagnate and decay? What is this constant striving to be something? What does this strife, this effort, indicate? And, does understanding come through effort, through striving? One is constantly striving to become better, to change oneself, to fit oneself to a certain pattern, to become something - from the clerk to the manager, from the manager to the divine. And, does this striving bring understanding?
I think the question of effort should really be understood. What is it that is making the effort, and what do we mean by "the will to be"? We make an effort, do we not?, in order to achieve a result, in order to become better, in order to be more virtuous, or less of Something else. There is this constant battle going on in us between positive and negative desires, one superseding the other, one desire controlling the other - only we call it the higher and the lower self. But, obviously, it is still desire. You can place it at any level, and give it a different name; it is still desire, a craving to be something. There is also the constant strife within oneself and with others, with society.
Now, does this conflict of desires bring understanding? Does the conflict of opposites, the want and the non-want, bring clarification? And is there understanding in the struggle to approximate ourselves to an idea? So, the problem is not the strife, the struggle, or what would happen if we did not struggle, if we did not make an effort, if we did not strive to be something, psychologically as well as outwardly; the problem is, how does understanding come into being? Because, when once there is understanding, there is no strife. What you understand, of that you are free.
How does understanding come into being? I do not know if you have ever noticed that the more you struggle to understand, the less you understand any problem. But, the moment you cease to struggle and let the problem tell you the whole story, give all its significance - then there is understanding; which means, obviously, that to understand, the mind must be quiet. The mind must be choicelessly, passively, aware; and in that state, there is understanding of the many problems of our life.
The questioner wants to know if there is, or if there is not, a Divine Plan. I do not know what you mean by a "Divine Plan." But we do know, do we not?, that we are in sorrow, that we are in confusion, that confusion and sorrow are ever on the increase, socially, psychologically, individually and collectively. It is what we have made of this world. Whether there is a Divine Plan or not, is not important at all. But what is important is, to understand the confusion in which we live, outwardly as well as inwardly. And to understand that confusion, we must begin, obviously, with ourselves - because we are confusion; it is we who have produced this outward confusion in the world. And to clear up that confusion, we must begin with ourselves; because, what we are, the world is.
Now, you will say, "Well, it will take a very long time in this way to bring about order in the world." I'm not at all sure that you are right; because, after all, it's one or two who are very clear, who understand, that bring about a revolution, a change. But we are lazy, you see; that is the difficulty. We want others to change, we want circumstances to change, we want the Government to order our lives, or some miracle to take place that will transform us. And so, we abide with confusion.
So, what is really important, is not to inquire if there is or if there is not a Divine Plan; because, over that you will waste speculative hours, proving that there is or there is not. That becomes a game for the propagandists. But what is important, is really to free oneself from confusion; and that does not take a long period of time. What is essential is to see that one is confused, that all activity, all action which springs from confusion, must be confused also. It's like a confused person seeking a leader: his leader must also be confused. So, what is essential, is to see that one is confused, and not try to escape from it, not try to find explanations for it: be passively, choicelessly, aware. And then you will see, that quite a different action springs from that passive awareness; because, if you make an effort to clarify the state of confusion, what you create will still be confused. But, if you are aware of yourself, choicelessly, passively aware, then that confusion unfolds, and fades away.
You will see, if you will experiment with this - and it will not take a long period of time, because time is not involved in it at all - that clarification comes into being. But you must give your whole attention, your whole interest, to it. And I am not at all sure that most of us do not like to be confused - because in the state of confusion you need not act. And so we are satisfied with the confusion; because, to understand confusion, demands action which is not the pursuit of an ideal or an ideation.
So, the question whether there is, or whether there is not, a Divine Plan, is irrelevant. We have to understand ourselves and the world we have created: the misery, the confusion, the conflict, the wars, the divisions, the exploitations. All that is the result of ourselves in relationship with others. And if we can understand ourselves in relationship with others, if we can see how we use others, how we try to escape from ourselves through people, through property, through knowledge and therefore give immense significance to relationship, to property, to knowledge - if we can see all that, be aware of it passively, then we shall be free from that background which we are. Then only is there a possibility of finding out what is. But, to spend hours speculating whether there is a Divine Plan or not, striving to find out about it, lecturing about it, seems to me so infantile. For, peace does not come into being through conformity to any plan, whether the plan is left, right, or divine. Conformity is mere suppression, and in suppression there is fear. Only in understanding can there be peace and tranquillity; and in that tranquillity, reality comes into being.
Krishnamurti: What do we mean by past experience? How do you experience a challenge? After all, life is a process of challenge and response, is it not? - the challenge always being new, otherwise it is not a challenge. And our response is inevitably the outcome of the background, of our conditioning. So, the response, if it is not adequate, full, complete with regard to the challenge, must create friction, must create conflict. It is this conflict between the challenge and the response that we call experience. I do not know if you have ever noticed that, if your response to the challenge is complete, there is only a state of experiencing, not the remembrance of an experience. But, when the response is not adequate to the challenge, then we cling to the memory of the experience.
It is not so difficult; don't be so puzzled. Let us explore it a little more, and you will see. As I said, life is a process of challenge and response - at all levels, not at one particular level; and as long as that response is not adequate to the challenge, there must be conflict. Surely, that is obvious. And conflict invariably prevents understanding. Through conflict, one cannot understand any problem, can one? If I am constantly quarrelling with my neighbour, with my wife, with my associates, it is not possible to understand that relationship. It is possible to understand only when there is no conflict.
And does understanding come suddenly? That is, can conflict cease suddenly? Or, must one go through innumerable conflicts, understanding each conflict, and then be free of all conflict? That is, to put the problem differently, behind this question I'm sure there is another question: "Since you have been through the various fogs, confusions, conflicts, belief in Masters, in reincarnation, the various societies, and so on and so on, must I not also go through them? Since you have been through certain phases, must I not also go through those phases, in order to be free?" That is, must we not all experience confusion, in order to be free of confusion?
So, the problem is, is it not?, does understanding come through following or accepting certain patterns, and living through those patterns in order to be free? Say, for example, at one time you believed in certain ideas; but now, you have pushed them aside, you are free and have understanding. And I come along and see that you have lived through certain beliefs, and have pushed them aside and gained understanding. So I say to myself, "I will also follow those beliefs, or accept those beliefs, and eventually I will come to understanding." Surely, that is a wrong process, is it not? What is important is to understand. Is understanding a matter of time? Surely not. If you are interested in something, there is no question of time. Your whole being is there, concentrated, completely absorbed in that thing. And it is only when you want to gain a result that the question of time comes in. So, if you treat understanding as an end to be gained, then you require time, then you talk about "immediate" or "postponed." But, understanding, surely is not an end-process. Understanding comes when you are quiet, when the mind is still. And if you see the necessity of the mind being still, then immediately there is understanding.
Krishnamurti: Now, what is the purpose of meditation? And what do we mean by meditation? I do not know if you have meditated; so, let us experiment together to find out what is true meditation. Don't listen merely to my expression of it; but together we'll find out and experience what is true meditation. Because, meditation is important, isn't it? If you do not know what is right meditation, there is no self-knowledge; and without knowing yourself, meditation has no meaning. To sit in a corner or walk about in the garden or in the street, and try to meditate, has no meaning. That only leads to a peculiar concentration, which is exclusion. I'm sure some of you have tried all those methods. That is, you try to concentrate on a particular object, try to force the mind, when it is wandering all over the place, to be concentrated; and when that fails, you pray.
So, if one really wants to understand what is right meditation, one must find out what are the false things which we have called meditation. Obviously, concentration is not meditation - because, if you observe, in the process of concentration there is exclusion, and therefore there is distraction. You are trying to concentrate on something, and your mind is wandering off towards something else; and there is this constant battle going on to be fixed on one point while the mind refuses and wanders off. And so we spend years trying to concentrate, to learn concentration, which is mistakenly called meditation.
Then there is the question of prayer. Prayer obviously produces results, other- wise millions wouldn't pray. And in praying, obviously the mind is made quiet; by constant repetition of certain phrases, the mind does become quiet. And in that quietness there is a certain intimation, certain perceptions, certain responses. But that is still a part of the trick of the mind - because, after all, through a form of mesmerism you can make the mind very quiet. And in that quietness there are certain hidden responses arising from the unconscious and from outside the consciousness. But, it is still a state in which there is no understanding.
And, meditation is not devotion - devotion to an idea to a picture, to a principle; because, the things of the mind are still idolatrous. One may not worship a statue, considering it idolatrous and silly, superstitious; but one does worship, as most people do, the things of the mind: and that is also idolatrous. And, to be devoted to a picture or an idea, to a Master, is not meditation. Obviously, it's a form of escape from oneself. It's a very comforting escape, but it's still an escape.
And this constant striving to become virtuous, to acquire virtue through discipline, through careful examination of oneself and so on, is obviously not meditation either. Most of us are caught in these processes; and since they do not give understanding of ourselves, they are not the way of right meditation. After all, without understanding yourself, what basis have you for right thinking? All that you will do, without that understanding of yourself, is to conform to the background, to the response of your conditioning. And such response to the conditioning is not meditation. But to be aware of those responses, that is, to be aware of the movements of thought and feeling, without any sense of condemnation, so that the movements of the self, the ways of the self, are completely understood - that way is the way of right meditation.
Meditation is not a withdrawal from life. Meditation is a process of understanding oneself. And when one begins to understand oneself, not only the conscious but all the hidden parts of oneself as well, then there comes tranquillity. A mind that is made still, through meditation, through compulsion, through conformity, is not still. It is a stagnant mind. It is not a mind that is alert, passive, capable of creative receptivity. Meditation demands constant watchfulness, constant awareness of every word, every thought and feeling, which reveals the state of our own being, the hidden as well as the superficial; and as that is arduous, we escape into every kind of comforting, deceptive thing, and call it meditation.
If one can see that self-knowledge is the beginning of meditation, then the problem becomes extraordinarily interesting and vital. Because, after all, if there is no self-knowledge, you may practise what you call meditation and still be attached to your principles, to your family, to your property; or, giving up your property, you may be attached to an idea and be so concentrated on it that you create more and more of that idea. Surely, that is not meditation. So, self-knowledge is the beginning of meditation; without self-knowledge there is no meditation. And as one goes deeper into the question of self-knowledge not only does the upper mind become tranquil quiet, but the different layers of the hidden are revealed. When the superficial mind is quiet, then the unconscious, the hidden layers of consciousness project themselves; they reveal their content, they give their intimations; so that the whole process of one's being is completely understood.
So, the mind becomes extremely quiet - is quiet. It is not made quiet, it is not compelled to be quiet by a reward, by fear. Then there is a silence in which reality comes into being. But that silence is not Christian silence, or Hindu silence, or Buddhist silence. That silence is silence, not named. Therefore, if you follow the path of Christian silence or Hindu or Buddhist, you will never be silent. Therefore, a man who would find reality must abandon his condition completely - whether Christian, Hindu, Buddhist or of any other group. Merely to strengthen the background through meditation through conformity brings about stagnation of the mind, dullness of the mind; and I'm not at all sure that's not what most of us want - because it's so much easier to create a pattern and follow it. But to be free of the background demands constant watchfulness in relationship.
And, when once that silence is, then there is an extraordinary creative state - not that you must write poems, paint pictures: you may or you may not. But that silence is not to be pursued, copied, imitated - then it ceases to be silence. You cannot come to it through any path. It comes into being, only when the ways of the self are understood, and the self, with all its activities and mischief, comes to an end. That is, when the mind ceases to create, then there is creation. Therefore, the mind must become simple, must become quiet, must be quiet - the "must" is wrong: to say the mind must be quiet, implies compulsion. And the mind is quiet only when the whole process of the self has come to an end. When all the ways of the self are understood, and therefore the activities of the self have come to an end - then only is there silence. That silence is true meditation; and in that silence the eternal comes into being.
Nearly a year ago, I heard about a new coffee shop that had just opened the town where we live, called Purdy’s Coffee Company. Although I write and work from home, there are days when I need a change of scenery. So, when I learned about Purdy’s, it wasn’t long before I just had to check it out.

I would like to know if you would even consider the foil version for riding waves (without the hydrofoil). It sounds really good to have a board for foil and waves that can be checked in as normal baggage but will it be very limited in waves? Has any of you tried it?
You might also want to call the company directly and talk to a few employees that have used them - I’ve gotten some good information this way. From what I’ve read, Nobile was an early leader building split boards and has gotten good reviews. I don’t think you can go wrong buying one of their boards and the resale value should be good. Good luck and be sure to post a review on how you like them.
I am also tempted by it. Someone I know got one it's really nice not too heavy good as a surf good for foiling and easy to travel with great combo!
Foil 5.2. Its very good board for strapless riding. Different feel than "normal" volume board - but i like it much much better - i mean this different feel. Its much calmer and less sketchy
Unfortunately the conditions are not good for foiling at Vargas (GC) right now. (To be honest I haven’t foiled one meter at all but really looking forward to it) so I’ve had some sessions with it with straps in choppy conditions on my 7m.
It doesn’t come close to my surfboard, I wished it was more like it.. But I’m having fun on it and starting to like it a bit more every day and I will ditch the straps tomorrow because the strapped jumping feels heavy and the board looks like it’s meant to ride strapless..
The board is very stable, strap / foot change in gybe or after is very easy, you can almost walk around unpunished..
Traveling was indeed super easy with it and when assembled (which is very easy) it doesn’t feel like a split board, it’s solid (and a bit heavy but that’s the price of a split board I think)
The travel bag is very nice but Nobile should ditch the wheels, totally unnecessary and useless the way they are now, like Gumball also said it’s a waste of at least half a kilo luggage.
If you really looking for a good waveboard than first try before you buy, don’t expect a great waveboard, it is simply not fast enough in speeding up, the bottom turns and cut backs are slow, you need to adjust (and that took me some time)
I'm considering buying w LW TT board preferable in split form (already have a NHP split) can you guy confirm how much better would be a flying carpet (or other LW board) vs Nobile Foil Infinity split? I'm looking to try foil next year and buying some LW board so I though I could kill two birds with one stone...

Anna Fitzgerald exists because her parents specifically created her embryo as a donor match for her older sister Kate in Jodi Picoult’s bestselling novel My Sister’s Keeper. The story follows Anna’s attempts to make donor decisions herself by filing a lawsuit against her parents. Her whole life has involved huge procedures all chosen for her; those also make it difficult for her to live life normally, almost as though she had leukemia too. Like most 13-year-olds, she feels unsure as she navigates making choices for herself, especially when tension arises due to her parents not agreeing.
In some ways, we all can relate to Anna in our desire for approval. We all seek approval from our parents, our peers, our friends even as adults. Yet we forget that we need not live by their standards. Even Queen Elizabeth I points this out to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown when she asserts that her job requires her to make decisions based on God’s approval rather than the general public. In most cases, this would follow the wiser direction anyway considering the unapproving parties tend to not have expertise in the field they project their opinion. Mrs. Fitzgerald unquestionably cares about her daughters, but she doesn’t have the expertise to understand what will happen to Kate or Anna if they follow through with a kidney donation. In fact, the doctor said Kate had passed the point in renal failure where it would benefit her. Anna seeks counsel and help from experts, despite not having her mother’s approval.
While we want to live at peace with those around us, it serves us all to stand on our proper foundations to make our decisions rather than sway to gain temporary approval. It also does us well to seek counsel from multiple sources. Chrystal Evans Hurst wisely encourages readers to gather multiple types of people for your support team in She’s Still There, including a mentor figure ahead of you on the same career path and a friend who cheers you on by your side. Having a firm foundation and a support team makes it easier to keep moving forward and stay focused on your purpose.
Desiring approval comes naturally. So does the angst felt when we don’t get it. However, we can continue forward with strength and purpose and do better than if we allowed ourselves to waver. We have support around us to give us the guidance and encouragement we need to make progress. Making decisions doesn’t necessarily get easier, but we can rest assured knowing we base them on truth.

President* Donald Trump held a press conference in Indianapolis, at which he insisted that there were enough votes to pass the latest GOP health care abomination, which of course there are not, and he also prattled on about the looming massive GOP tax reform plan.
The Washington Post did a fact check on Trump’s presser and his statements on the tax plan, and it was not kind.
Even Business Insider has an article up predicting how this so-called tax reform will go down in flames.
The standard by which the Trump tax plan should be judged is the standard that the Trump administration itself has set.
“There will be no absolute tax cut for the upper class,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said shortly after the election. “My plan is for the working people,” President Trump said yesterday. “I don’t benefit.”
None of that is true. It’s the latest disturbing example of politicians telling falsehoods about a proposed policy. Trump has done so repeatedly, and now members of Congress are doing it more often, too. These aren’t mere exaggerations or truth shadings; they are often just lies.
“Trump’s tax plan: prioritize cuts for the rich, say he isn’t,” as New York Magazine succinctly puts it.
You can read The Times Editorial Board’s analysis — that the plan relies on the discredited notion that tax cuts for the rich help everyone — here.
It is impossible to fact check Donald Trump, because Donald Trump is a fact free zone. One should always start with the assumption that every word that came out of is mouth is either a lie, a half truth, or a random thought that spilled out of his brain due to free association or the last Faux Noise Nutwork program he watched, and then focus the analysis on whether any of his statements of a kernel of truth.
What the GOP tax plan would do to the United States is what Brownback managed to do in Kansas. He was able to do a full-on implementation of GOP ta cutting and imaginary math implementing the trickle down theory. As a result, Kansas is practically bankrupt, and even members of the GOP had to cross the isle to slap Brownback down and implement rational taxes to staunch the bleeding.
This is just one more round of the one percent not being satisfied with having 99% of the wealth, they want it all. The estate tax? That affects precisely two out of one thousand deaths. And those two are the richest citizens. But we must be sure to continue the transfer of wealth to a tiny handful, and resist any efforts to end the wealth inequality that is poisoning our society and our democracy and the economic health of our nation.
Well, aside from the white supremacist racism, the homophobia, the sexism, and the general bigotry and hatred of anyone not lucky enough to be born white. That is the base. That is who Trump is now playing to. That is what Roy Moore will bring from Alabama.

Love these photos. The maxi skirt looks gorgeous on you! I wish we had the sun here, but we only have rain rain rain.
! This post was written long ago. What you're reading is not necessarily how I feel about things in 2017. This blog was started by an 18-year-old in 2001. Please, keep that in mind before you freak out.
This started out as an experiment, by naming things that are basically synonyms for their taxonomies. It ended up as a very strange representation of love in general, how love reigns a person, ruins a person, builds a person, destroys a person, makes a person dreamy, makes a person realistic. Add some deliberately placed commas to it and there's a third meaning, too.
My paper, war, fast food, airship, battle, terrorist attack, book, accident, dream, holiday, maturity, toothpaste, motorcycle, lover, queen, game, destruction, volcano, dress, politician, father, planet, writer...
Bonus...can you identify all these words with their most famous examples? The first one counts only if you're from my country...the rest count pretty much worldwide.
If the internet brought you here, you must be very, very confused now, because this has got to be the last place you ever wanted to end up.
This blog has no niche, no specific readership and no specific purpose. It has been around for about 17 years, in various places, under various names. I don’t look at my angsty teenager posts, and I don’t think anybody should, for the sake of their sanity.
I was born on the day Hergé died – therefore, he has an epic death date and I have an epic birth date, but it implies guilt from day one. The country I was born in no longer exists, neither does the one I went to school in and so on.
I’m a grey-asexual gravitating towards heterosexuality. After my attempt to convert myself to atheism failed, I am not sure if I would call myself an agnostic or a syncretist. I identify as a feminist, but most things passed as feminism nowadays strike me as too commercial. Ideally, I don’t want to be a part of a club that would want me as a member.
Big Five identified me as a RLUAI, MBTI as ENFP, Socionics as EEI/EFP Ennaegram as 4 sx (tritype 4w3 7w8 1w2 sx so sp). Horoscope identifies me as a Pisces.

The GOP opposed them all and have have tried to kill them or at least profit from them as GW Bush tried with Social security and the GOP-Romney-Ryan tried with Medicare. Somehow, the GOP do not grasp that they lost the election in which Romney vowed to repeal the ACA.

The grey skies looked pretty much the same at 3am as they did at 3pm, so a good night-time sighting was more than possible.

Before then, fearful of its environmental reputation, Unilever had joined another environment group, WWF, to set up the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), with the aim of eventually buying only palm oil that was not grown on recently cleared forest land.

The starkly beautiful Galapagos Islands offer an extraordinary cruise experience. A visit to this archipelago, located in the Pacific Ocean about 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador, feels like a step back in time, or a visit to a land that time forgot.
Cruising is an ideal way to see the islands and their fascinating inhabitants, many of which – like the famous blue-footed boobie – are found nowhere else on earth. The spectacular birds of the islands also include frigates, Darwin finches, storm petrels, waved albatrosses, Galapagos hawks and tropical penguins. There are giant tortoises, tiny sea turtles, lava lizards, and sea lions, too.
These isolated, volcanic islands provided naturalist Charles Darwin with inspiration for his 1859 book about evolution, On the Origin of Species. Darwin studied the islands’ mockingbirds and tortoises, finding differences in the animals that lived on separate islands. He theorized that slight differences in terrain and climate caused the animals on each island to evolve differently.
On your cruise, a naturalist presents nightly lectures to help familiarize passengers with the sights, sounds and history of the islands.
You can expect to visit several of the islands, starting with Isla Baltra and the low-lying island of North Seymour, where blue-footed boobies and a large colony of frigate birds nest. There are opportunities to snorkel at Champion Island, home to a number of Floreana mocking birds. The island of Floreana itself features flamingos and white-cheeked pintail ducks.
The island of San Salvador has striking volcanic formations, including lava tubes and tuff cones. Sea lions and penguins are often seen off Pinnacle Rock. The cold waters of Elizabeth Bay off Isabela Island provide a perfect habitat for Galapagos penguins. Other unique sights of the islands include a "white forest" of incense trees and cotton plants, dramatic grottos formed of black lava and flightless cormorant birds.
Just four of the 19 principal Galapagos Islands are inhabited by humans. The most developed island is Santa Cruz, where the town of Puerto Ayora offers hotels, restaurants and shops. East of the town is the Charles Darwin Research Station, where visitors can learn more about the islands’ geology, ecology and weather patterns and see some of the famous giant tortoises.
Perhaps the most important item you can pack for a Galapagos Islands cruise is a camera. For whatever reason – perhaps the isolation of the islands or a lack of large predators – the animal population seems to have a rare sense of security. They are generally accepting of the presence of humans, and will take little notice of your camera as you snap away. You’ll definitely want to have a camera at the ready to take photos of the remarkable and appealing creatures you’ll see.
Protected as a national park since 1959, the Galapagos Islands represent a delicate and precious ecosystem. Cruise lines strive to provide their guests with the unique experience of a Galapagos cruise with as little environmental impact to the islands as possible.

At some point we'll be at new data center.. I'm not entirely certain when it'll happen. Probably within the next couple days. The old server was in NJ, this server will be in MD. We might get a bit faster load times. The site will not go down and there is no planned maintenance. In fact everything is being transferred live with no down time. I've also been meaning to optimize AC for increased performance, load times, etc. because this site could potentially be significantly faster if I put some effort into troubleshooting a couple things.. but I'm holding off on doing that until we upgrade to IPB4 sometime later this year.
With so many vbulletin customers bitching about the possibility of vBulletin charging for an upgrade to the vb 4 code, vbulletin has finally announced that they will not charge for the upgrade... but they will be implementing new license terms.. with their current terms they were obligated to not charge for a new major version upgrade. But my guess is that the new terms will allow them to make as much money as possible by screwing people over on future upgrades.
The vbulletin team announced that vBulletin 4.0 would come out by the end of June 2009. It is October 14th today and with an announcement like this and a new website, you would think vbulletin 4.0 has finally been released! But no! It is still in alpha testing, there is no demo available and I have been given the opportunity to purchase the upgrade to the suite for the $130 discount for only 16-17 more days. And they still have not announced when the vb 4.0 version will even come out.
And even though I bought the blog add-on for $50 a year ago, I get the same discount price as someone who only owns just the forum license. wtf.
When my license support renewal is up, which last year would have costed me $40 for updates, will now cost me $195 for the new license if I haven't paid the $130 or more by then to download vbulletin 4.0 which may still not be out by then considering they are 4 months behind schedule with no product.
So. We will probably continue running vb 3.8 until we find another alternative or vbulletin changes their pricing structure (which I'm sure they won't). I wouldn't mind paying for new forum software, we've spent plenty on vb over the years with renewal costs and one time purchases. But I can't justify staying with the company because of the part I have put in bold above.
If we use just the forums and pay the initial upgrade price of $195 or so in january and switch to a free blog system because the version we have won't be compatible with vb 4.0... we'll still be stuck with another issue. Once vb 5.0 comes out (which should be 12-18 months according to a staff member), we'll have to buy a brand new vbulletin license for version 5 at the full price of another $195. And assuming a new major release then comes out every 1 or 2 years, it'll be hundreds of dollars every year or two just to keep using this software that still doesn't do everything I want it to do.
I'm really starting to hate vbulletin. If I want to stay with this forum software, the only way I'll save money is by paying the cheaper upgrade cost of $130 which gives me the entire suite, but I only have 16 days to make my decision or pay $200 in January and only get the forum software.
Anyone have any forum or blog recommendations? I was thinking about invision power board, but they're in the process of releasing a new cms like system and I don't know if that will be bundled in with their current suite. But even ipb is $250 for the suite with $60 renewal costs. But even that price is better than the new vbulletin price structure. Apparently, I have to make a decision within 16 days. *kicks vB in the balls*
Drag and drop images right into the editor. I've been waiting for this feature. No more having to click attach and then navigate to the right folder where your image is.. just drag it right into the editor.
This is a big change and I hope they pull it off correctly. All our custom bbcodes will be negated. But the only custom bbcode we actually use is the spoiler tag, which will now be a default feature. All other custom bbcodes will now have to be created as CKEditor plugins.. but there are already a lot of ckeditor plugins available. So I could technically add a variety of new editor features.
Good! No more having to click the load saved content option. Simplifying this will make the auto save much better.
Oh! and the editor will now be fully skin-able! The editor won't have to be glaring white on a dark theme anymore.
Also, the current skins that we use are going to be upgraded for IPB 4.0. We won't have to change the entire look of the site.
I finished an upgrade to the site, which included an editor upgrade and updated skin fixes. So far it looks like everything is fine, but I'm still not caring for this editor. In firefox, the quote feature seems a bit off. After you hit quote, you should hit an arrow button before typing or pasting to make it look correct. I'll have to fill out a bug report for it.
This is a major announcement about our community.. We are finally ditching vBulletin! We will be switching to Invision Power Board software. We should retain all posts, post counts, albums, private messages, etc. Expect major changes with the overall site. We will be turning ancientclan.com into an actual website again. But it will not be anime based. We have had a good run as an anime site, but its time for us to move away from that specific genre and move towards a more general entertainment website focusing more on movies, television series, video games, anime, things that interest us, etc.
1) We will no longer have anime themes. We will save some of our current themes for their color layouts and will be implementing them into different color selections for the site.
2) We will be taking all our current forums, setting them as subforums into an Archive category and we will set them for archived so they will get no new posts but will be available for everyone to view.
4) We will have a variety of new features, I'll get a new shoutbox back up, we will have a full functioning gallery, improved blogs, and an article system for the main site.
The conversion process will be in two parts. First, I will need to install the new software. Second, I will run the conversion software to import all our posts, etc, into the new database. There is no timetable yet for when this will happen. But it will happen sometime in the next 2-3 weekends.
Port Blair, May 9: ACity Conference was organised today at Khaitan Kalyan Mandapam, Junglighat by the City Congress Committee, wherein the PCC President, Shri Kuldeep Rai Sharma was the Chief Guest. Addressing the gathering Sharma urged upon to be united and work for the betterment of the people of the islands.
Whatever achievement he has achieved at the President is due to the devoted and selfless work rendered by the party workers, said Sharma He also urged upon the workers to reach to every doors with the policies and programmes of UPA Government, which are for the betterment of the Country and its people.

The conference later concluded with vote of thanks proposed by Sahaabuddin.

Topological semimetals are three-dimensional crystalline materials where electronic energy bands disperse linearly from bulk nodes. While gapless, they nevertheless have robust topological properties akin to their insulating cousins. Studying these via transport measurements is challenging, owing to the inevitable complication that 'normal' bulk conduction masks the more subtle topological phenomena. I will present theoretical arguments that show how non-local transport measurements in a magnetic field may be used to circumvent this problem in two ways. First, the bulk chiral anomaly may be detected via a nonlocal resistance in a Hall geometry. Second, the surface "Fermi arcs" give rise to resonant transmission of microwave radiation across a slab, with a resonant frequency that is dependent both on perpendicular field and sample size. Importantly, both these experiments rely only on a long charge relaxation time, rather than a long phase coherence time, and are therefore relatively robust against disorder. I will comment on the applicability of these ideas to both Weyl and Dirac semimetals.

Overview of the Trane XL90 line of Furnace, including consumer reviews, model number, specs and warranty information. Parts Town has the largest in-stock inventory of genuine OEM Trane parts with fast same day shipping until 9pm ET. Find the part you need today.
Comments on one consumer forum rated Trane as the number two preferred furnace, second to Carrier and ahead trane xl90 manual York. When I replace this unit I will not even consider using Trane.
After a few tries, the authorized technician found that the main board was bad, together with the draft inducer.
We converted from electricity to gas and purchased this furnace in Considering the other 2 bad reviews I’ve seen here, I guess we’re the lucky ones. Other features include a washable filter, one-piece heat exchanger that requires no welding, electro-deposition paint, and an enclosed burner box. Trane finally came out and removed furnace and replaced with new one and within months problems began again. XL90 Warranty Trane XL90 gas furnace comes with a 5-year limited warranty on internal functional parts and trane xl90 manual lifetime warranty on the heat trane xl90 manual.
The unit was completely unreliable from the very moment its warranty had expired and Trane service and parts are very expensive. I’ll agree that replacement parts are likely expensive. First winter we lived there found it blowing cold air.
This is another stupid design where they put the cable in the box with the trane xl90 manual I replaced a 25 year old furnace with a new Trane XV80 with air conditioning in Its trane xl90 manual the cheapest system, but I’m willin to pay for the feautures and realiabiloty it offers.
I moved into a home manuxl a Trane xl90 that was installed in I liked the Trane fully modulating gas valve and variable speed fan to rtane both gas savings and comfort.
Nearly 12 years later, we have xo90 no problems and have trane xl90 manual great warmth. I do not recommend Trane products. We’ve had our XL90 for almost 10 years.
Now, inI’ve trabe had many issues, trane xl90 manual starting in after the warranty expired! Now I found out that I must change the flame detector.
Trane XL90 gas furnace comes with a 5-year limited warranty on internal functional parts and a lifetime warranty on the heat exchanger. Looked at Lennox, Carrier, Goodman and Trane. Now replacing blower motor and circuit board. My zip code is: In addition to the usual vertical positioning, it can also be installed horizontally. The Trane XL90 gas furnace comes in a convenient pre-painted galvanized steel cabinet of 40″ by 28″ trane xl90 manual.
This time, the igniter cable somehow was burned in trane xl90 manual section. To avail of these warranties, consumers need to register their products within 60 days of installation.
Trane xl90 manual are the 10 Best Furnaces? I replaced the burned x90 and the ignitor and cleaned out the gunk in the lines that drain condensate. The two stage, high efficiency system delivers consistent heat.
trane xl90 manual Our only service expenses have been routine service. This model comes with a four-speed blower, a self-diagnostic microelectronic controller, and an adaptive silicon nitride trane xl90 manual. Needed to replace my system after the current furnace died. Initially, after some bad communication internally with my service provider, a knowledgeable service tech came out and figured out quickly that the original ignitor was dead.
Factors considered include the number of levels, size of building, and frequency of use. Extended warranty options are also available, and they cover labor and other costs not included in the manufacturer’s limited warranty.
There have been occasions where I’ve had to reboot the thing, but this year it really stopped working, just blowing cold air. Never had this much trouble with a furnace. I figured the unit to be relatively young and good trane xl90 manual a few years to come. Two-stage heating lets consumers choose different settings depending on whether the temp is just a little trane xl90 manual or well below zero. Trane xl90 manual need a new: I fixed the cable and then added some thermal protection.
This is okay, they can go bad after a few years, but a technician told me that the heat exchanger may also be bad! After watching the guy do it, fortunately our year warranty manuap honored.
After replacing the board, it worked okay for two years but then it failed again! Complicated systems, motherboards like a computer etc.
Have spent a lot just keeping this HVAC system operational. Xl0 on the Internet, I found out that many people had the same issue. They are known to make weak boards, trane xl90 manual.
This high efficiency furnace has mmanual us significant heating expenses since trane xl90 manual converted. To me, it looks like a manufacturing defect, but I had to pay. Since then, I have had to trane xl90 manual the ignitor at least once every winter, and it still has a tendency to run even when the flame sputters out at the startup so that I have to go down and throw the breaker to force a restart.

November 9, 2018 Comments Off on New Hampton Construction Making Significant Progress Despite Tough Weather
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday celebrated the release of new economic data, claiming the U.S. is now the "economic envy of the entire world."
Trump was responding to new growth numbers announced on Friday that show the U.S. economy surged in the April-June quarter to an annual growth rate of 4.1 percent — the fastest pace since 2014.
"We've accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions," Trump told reporters during hastily arranged remarks on the South Lawn of the White House, where he was joined by Vice President Mike Pence and flanked by members of his economic team.
"Once again, we are the economic envy of the entire world," Trump said, adding that "America is being respected again."
The numbers were driven by consumers who began spending the tax cuts Trump signed into law last year and exporters who have been rushing to get their products delivered ahead of retaliatory tariffs.
Trump, who has repeatedly attacked the economic record of his predecessor's administration, pledged during the 2016 campaign to double growth to 4 percent or better. And he has been trying to highlight economic gains ahead of the midterm elections.
But Trump, ever the salesman, predicted even higher growth as he renegotiates the nation's trade deals, saying, "We're going to go a lot higher than these numbers." And he insisted the economic numbers are "very sustainable" and not "a one-time shot."
Private forecasters cautioned that the April-June pace is unsustainable because, they say, it stems from temporary factors, including a rush by exporters of soybeans and other products to get their shipments out before retaliatory tariffs took effect.
The transformation is also not as dramatic as Trump claims — and in many ways the 4.1 percent annualized growth during the second quarter is in line with an economic expansion that just entered its tenth year.
During Barack Obama's presidency, there were four quarters when annualized growth exceeded the level that Trump praised on Friday. And in 2015, full-year economic growth nearly reached the 3 percent level being targeted by the Trump administration this year when it hit 2.9 percent.
Unlike in 2015, growth has accelerated this year, in part, because of the stimulus from Trump's deficit-funded tax cuts. Trump has said he sees annual growth of 3 percent or more as sustainable. But Federal Reserve officials and outside economists don't expect a permanent upshift. Their forecasts predict that growth will return to roughly 2 percent, which largely reflects a demographic change beyond the White House's control.
Due to declines in birth rates, workers will be joining the economy at a slower pace and this hurts overall growth levels.
PITTSBURGH (NewsRadio 1020 KDKA) — The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority has issued a precautionary flush and boil water advisory for Pittsburgh’s Spring Hill-City View neighborhood.
The advisory comes after there was a temporary loss of water pressure around 5 a.m. Thursday while PWSA crews repaired a leaking valve and water line on Buente Street.
Residents should flush lines first by running water for at least one minute then boil any water for consumption vigorously for one minute.

Earlier this year Town & Country reported on the difficulty real-estates agents were having selling listings in Trump Tower, the number of which escalated significantly since President Trump's election. Now sales data show that even the units that have sold did so at below-market prices.
There are currently 21 apartments for sale or rent in the building, according to , and only five condos have sold since Trump took office. The five transactions show that the "average price per square foot in Trump Tower of about $2,100 was down 13 percent from 2016 and 23 percent from 2015, according to sales data compiled by real estate website CityRealty.com" and first . The median sales price — $2.2 million — was the lowest since 2007.
For comparison, the median sales price for residential units in all of Midtown Manhattan has increased by 5.6 percent since 2015, according to Brown Harris Stevens data. Prices per square foot have also risen, by .3 percent.
"This is clearly a remarkable situation and obviously spurred by one resident being the president of the United States," Kirk Henckels, the vice chairman of Stribling & Associates, said earlier this year.
Now, residents and guests arriving at the 664-foot tower in midtown Manhattan are required to submit to airport-style security screening by the Secret Service. Even those who just want a coffee from the Starbucks on the tower's second floor have to put their bags through an x-ray machine. And outside the residents' entrance, on 56th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues, black SUVs are a constant presence. The block is closed to vehicular traffic, and pedestrians not visiting the tower are relegated to the southern side of the street.
The average price per square foot is also down at Trump International Hotel and Tower on . A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, which manages the condos at Trump Tower, told the Wall Street Journal that the price shifts could be attributed to year-over-year price declines in "the entire luxury market."
"Despite that, Trump buildings have continue to be a leader in average [price per square foot] against competitors," the spokeswoman said. "We cater to the most discerning buyers in the world, and while we can’t control the ebbs and flows of the market, we are incredibly proud of the overall performance that Trump properties continue to achieve."
Brown Harris Stevens broker Wendy Maitland told the that "a Trump building has always been a turn-off for some people and a turn-on for others. She and fellow BHS broker Jason Karadus previously listed a on the 39th floor for $7.5 million. (The residence is now off the market.)
Henckels points out that "saying that the Secret Service is a positive is a double-edged sword. There is no doubt that security is greatly improved, but it wasn't a problem before the Secret Service. When you have lemons, make lemonade. The flip side is that — my guess is — the Secret Service and resulting disruptions in the other tenants' quality of life is why there are so many new listings."
In addition, Henckels says, although Trump Tower "is a very luxurious, beautiful building in a prime location and is beautifully run," it's competing with "brand-new developments with tons of amenities" and "the current trend for a downtown location."

Left to right: Griffin, Maggie and Lily. Maggie and Lily are twin ewes. Maggie's birth weight was 10.5#s and Lily's was 5.5#s and a bottle lamb. You can take a look back at the early days here. After the first few days on the ground, Lily grew steadily and solidly thereafter. Griffin was born big. A single at birth he weighed in at 10.75#s and now a wether, is still just so darn handsome and personable. When looking at sheep for good characteristics one important view is the hind quarters. Each of these lambs show a straight backbone, good spread across the rear, legs not close together, with a solid build and bone structure.
Every feeding the lambs line up at the rack together...awfully cute, eh? Maggie and Lily's mother, Della, is to the left of Griffin. Quite often the lambs will be flanked by one or the other of the mothers at the hay feeder. Now that we are fully into off-pasture feedings I need to get coats on those lambs to protect the fleeces. That's always entertaining when they first sport their new duds!
When the opportunity arises I will catch a photo of Della and Maggie together face on. Their matched resemblance is uncanny and so beautiful.
Rhinebeck, as always, was incredible. We had awful weather on Friday for the trip out with driving wind and rain but the storm passed in the evening and the weekend, although cool on Saturday, was just perfect. I didn't get out of my booth at all on Saturday. Katie went out for some awesome fruit tarts for us as an afternoon treat but that was it! Needless to say, I didn't get a chance to take very many pictures.I heard from the main office at the fairgrounds that the preliminary head count for Saturday by 4PM was 16,000 and that is more than they have had in any two days in the past. There were a LOT of folks there! I didn
This is a partial view of my booth on Sunday morning before the opening...forgot to get the beginning photos so by this time the stock was gone on a number of yarns.
Here's Katie, my helper and shepherdess on the farm, on the left with a wonderful woman who came to shop with us. We had a great time! She sported one of my Tribal Tiaras that I offered for sale. They make you feel free and offbeat while all the time reigning your kingdom!
These two ladies stopped by having brought these beautiful brooms from a man who makes them right at the show. Apparently they will last for years and he even suggests leaving the rubber band around the bristles to keep the broom from sloping to the side eventually. That was a new idea to me, but makes sense. These gals swear by these brooms and covet them as do many of his customers. Check him out at Lone Oak Brooms in this youtube video!
The end of the day Saturday Katie and I passed through the livestock barns on our way to dinner. This dear sheep was so tucked she never even woke up while I watched her.
This ewe was quite the heart throb. When we came upon her she was baaaing away. It was dinner time but she hadn't had her hay yet and so we spent some time just loving her up and whispering sweet nothings in her ear. She was a real schmooze. When we left her I turned back and she had bedded down and was chewing cud. Sheep whisperers?
This woman happened to come by as Katie and I were leaving for the evening Saturday and danced to their music....quite a sight, a number of children joined in, all of it unrehearsed.
As Katie and I finished loaded on Sunday night and headed out I looked over to my left and this dog caught my eye. Looks like he is ready to go home!
I want to thank all of you who came to visit this year. It is what makes the show worthwhile for all of the weeks and months of preparation. My new line of yarns has hit the ground running and I so appreciate the enormous round of compliments and purchases you gave.
Countdown....Rhinebeck 2010 is this coming weekend. A few of the boxes that are packed with yarns....
all in natural dyed hues with yarn from the flock! Looking forward to the show! Please stop and say hello!
I shepherd a flock of CVM/ Romeldale sheep, the most rare and endangered breed of sheep in North America. Along with a commitment to their conservancy, hues derived from nature are the source of my artistic inspiration and being a good steward in their use and preservation is paramount in my work.
The yarns are washed and rinsed after the dyeing process but please be sure to wash and rinse in a gentle soap before beginning your project to remove any residual dyes remaining. Thank you!

You can see how I started off with just a few visitors to my site daily, to spikes of over a thousand on several occasions!!
So, I am taking a break for about a week and for the second year I plan to post three days a week, M - W - F.
I have several cool new patterns that will be issued soon. I'm going to be teaching in October at the American Sewing Expo in Highland, Michigan in October and will lots to say about that. Theresa LaQuey, my sister, has agreed to do some more guest blogging. Her stuff is always so fun to see. I will also share my fabric and sewing observations for museum shows I see and wherever I might travel this year.
Happy Anniversary and Congratulations! I've enjoyed visiting your blog and the sewing lessons and tips. I've learned a few things. I appreciate your presentations and enjoy your excursions into other fun stuff! Well done! The Goose
Congratulations on successfully achieving your goal in relation to your lovely blog. I look forward to my visits as you move in to your second year.
I'm only a recent visitor to your blog, but have loved your tutorials and sewing tips in respect of the Frozen costumes you've made.
Happy anniversary! I wish we could all take you out for a toast and a celebratory dinner. Thank you for an wonderful year. Your blog has been entertaining and informative and also warm and fuzzy. That's why I love you. Keep it up - you'll never run out of ideas.
A friend linked me your blog, then I linked some other friends, and we all enjoy it very much! I look forward to your future posts :D
Continuing from Monday ... My sister Theresa's stories of her terrific series of Steampunk costumes. The story picks up after the first pattern has been published and Simplicity wants another ... YAY!
Lest I forget to mention, I was very fortunate in having a previous client, Tricia Roush, who had become a very successful milliner and has so kind in lending her hats to Simplicity for the photo shoots.
After that pattern was such a hit, a second one was requested from me. I once again did a bit of research, and also really wanted this one to have a totally different feel from the previous one. I thought, well since the last package had a long reddingcoat and a corset that covered the bust, I should do a short bolero, a corset that cuts under the bust and a much fancier skirt. Here is my sketch for that idea. This also includes the swatches I had selected.
After I had figured out that I wanted to do a bustle skirt with an apron front and side cascades, I realized that with Steampunk you could get away with all sorts of odd things, so I thought, mini-bustle! Mini-bustle with a bolero that has more of a boudoir feel to it. Here is my sketch of that idea.
In the next blog on Friday, Theresa will talk about her fabric choices and she has a bunch of cool personal photos of these costumes with some neat close ups.
But, I thought I would share the photos of her muslins now. She makes the most beautiful muslins. They could be worn as finished garments themselves. As a matter of fact her first Steampunk costume pattern was supposed to only have one garment photographed, but when she sent in her muslin for approval, the folks at Simplicity thought it was so beautiful, they photographed the model wearing it and used the computer to add some color. This would be the tan one on the left.

I bought an iPad 2 awhile ago. I am still working on figuring out why. Don't get me wrong, I had several reasons for buying it:
I travel a lot while working. Before the iPad, I always had 4-6 books with me. I wanted to reduce the weight of my luggage, and bring more books. I read a lot, but I also want to bring my favorite reference books with me wherever I go.
I want to use my time effectively, for example by reading email while on the go. I can do that on my phone, but I wanted a bit more convenience.
My next book will be published as an eBook. I want to understand, I mean really grok, eBooks. I want to take full advantage of the medium.
Here is what I have found so far. I do read a lot of email, and browse the web, with my iPad, but I'll skip writing about that. Instead, I will focus on the other things that has made my working life easier the past few weeks.
I've bought quite a few books the past few weeks. Mostly new ones, but I am also adding some books I already own as paper books to my eBook reference library.
First of all, I do use the iPad for reading, a lot. Reading a book on the iPad works surprisingly well. However, the reading experience varies depending on which eBook reader you use. So far, my favorite readers are Apple's iBook and the Amazon's Kindle.
The first is that because iPad apps own the data they use, books are not shared between readers. If I buy a book from Amazon, I have to use the Kindle reader, whether I like it or not. Yes, there are workarounds, but there should not have to be. Which reader to use should be my choice, regardless of from where I downloaded the book.
The second thing is that it is impossible to organize the books I buy. In my bookshelf books are organized according to topic, but the eBook readers I have do not allow me to do that. For example, with the Kindle reader, I can organize books alphabetically by author or title, or by most recently read, but that is it. I cannot group my strategy books together, nor separate my management books from the children's books I buy for my son.
Apparently, Amazon expects me to buy only a few books from them. Unless they come up with a more convenient way for me to organize the books, they will be right. And of course, as I mentioned, grouping my books depending on where I bought them is absolutely ridiculous. Apple has got to fix it. Preferably very soon.
Here is one important thing I learned about eBooks: Pictures are fairly low resolution bitmaps. Some of the illustrations in my business books are more or less unreadable. This is disappointing. Still, it is a good thing to know. It is something I will need to work around in my next book. (Tempo! does not have that particular problem. The eBook version is in PDF format. It works pretty well if you read it in iBook. Slight drawback though: The book is available in Swedish only.)
I should mention a special kind of eBook though: Some eBooks, like Al Gore's Our Choice, come in the form of apps. Our Choice is beautiful: There are interactive animations, video, folding images... However, book-apps carry a significant penalty: It is large. I doubt I will ever have very many books like this one. Glad I bought Our Choice though.
When I read a particularly interesting book, I like to take notes. On the iPad, I have found that iThoughtsHD, a mindmapping program, works very well for this. Part of the reason I like iThoughtsHD is that it can import and export files in a variety of formats, including FreeMind and FreePlane, my favorite mindmapping programs on my computer.
Speaking of compatibility, DropBox has proven invaluable for transferring files between the iPad and my computer. iThoughtsHD can send files to DropBox, and so can many other apps. Unfortunately, because the iPad lacks a proper file system, there are plenty of programs that cannot save files to DropBox. Select your apps with care.
It is worth noting that you can get similar functionality by using other services. For example, many apps support Apple's MobileMe.
It is worth noting that I use services like DropBox and MobileMe for my personal files only. My clients generally don't allow them for security reasons. (No, this does not imply that these services have poor security, just that they have not been formally cleared for use by my clients.) If you use your iPad for work, you should consider what security restrictions may be in effect before using any cloud services.
I draw a lot of diagrams, and my favorite program for doing that on the Mac is OmniGraffle. There is a version of OmniGraffle for the iPad, and I tried it out as soon as I could. The iPad version is good, but I do prefer drawing on the Mac. The diagram above was drawn on my Mac and exported to the iPad via iTunes.
The key to drawing on the iPad is keeping it simple. Fortunately, that is generally pretty good advice. The picture above shows a simple Venn diagram. Now, all I need to do is to write a couple of books that fit the intersecting area. Oh, well, maybe I should finish some of my other writing projects first...
Is the iPad any good for presentations? Depends on what you want to do. I bought Keynote for iPad, but I will probably stick to developing presentations on my Mac. However, in some situations, like when making short presentations for one or two people, Keynote on the iPad may come in handy.
When you travel a lot, keeping in touch with the people close to you becomes incredibly important. Skype is a sanity saver. Strangely, there is no iPad version of the Skype app. Fortunately, the iPhone version works very well on the iPad.
Of course I have Skype on my computer, but using Skype on the iPad is a lot more convenient. I'd really like to have a version designed for the iPad though.
In the evenings, I like to relax with a TED talk or two. The TED application can download TED talks so I can view them offline. Viewing a TED talk make traveling by train or plane a lot more fun than it would otherwise be.
I have tried a couple of different RSS readers on the iPad. At the moment, I prefer Byline. Byline downloads articles from Google Reader, so I need a Reader account to use it.
Sometimes, I just want to relax and have a laugh. The Swedish television player SVT Play has several episodes of Shaun the Sheep available. One of my evening projects over the next few weeks is watching them all.
My son likes Glow Paint a simple drawing application. He is 5 years old, and learned to use the iPad in less than a minute. Granted, he already knew how to use my iPhone, but learning that didn't take long either. You know how you always throw away or just misplace your children's drawings? Well, when my son draws on the iPad, the drawing is never lost. years from now, provided that he is still interested in drawing, he and I will be able to follow how his style has developed over the years.
Listen to short interviews with Counsel’s investment specialists and get their latest views on current market themes.
We caught up with four of our investment specialists at our recent Fall Summit in Whistler, B.C., and we asked them for their perspective on the markets and the positioning of their portfolios. Managers from Marsico, Timbercreek, Mackenzie and Wasatch provide insight on the value they add to their portfolios, and how they are positioning their mandates in the current market environment and in the event of a potential economic downturn. Corrado Tiralongo, Counsel’s Chief Investment Officer, concludes by explaining how it all fits together.
The market strategist survey was as usual effectively worthless with most of the analysts predicting a market very close to where we are today, Treasury bills at 1.75 give or take, and without decisive opinions about whether the “fiscal cliff” will be avoided. Only Goldman Sachs stood out with an end of year S&P prediction of 1250.
I like the CAT call — 8 p/e also favorably ranked at Valueline — and this is on my watchlist after any market drop but low priced enough perhaps just to jump in. Continue reading →

The unusual 18:9 aspect ratio makes phones longer than wider and is harbinger of edge to edge screen design that in turn leads to more real estate on a compact form factor.

Ladies & gentlemen, we're still having a very nice time visiting Tahitian night life with our host Mr Eddie Lund. We dig it so much that today we got more music than usual!
It really seems like mr Lund really enjoyed the quiet and sweet life there as in 1962 he was very happy to say "MAKE MINE TAHITIAN" (Tahiti records EL1012).
This record is a pretty good exemple of the productions of Eddie Lund (and his tahitians) featuring many songs that soon became tahitian hits and that are still popular nowadays! Well, better than talk about it, let's just have the man relate us the story behind the modernisation of tahitian folk music himself...
It's quite funny that nearly as same time as "make mine tahitian" was released another record named "to you, Tahiti" (A VOUS TAHITI, Philips 840.531)... A very different record by Madeleine Moua and the ballets Heiva, more related to tahitian folklore mixing "festival" style music and backing vocals telling us the story of Tahiti's creation by the Maui god. This LP also feature a version of the song "Manea" (that means "you're lovely").
Another classic! Thanks so much for these great LPs, especially the one by Eddie. He is truly the king of Tahitian music.
Thanks so much for sharing this great album & details about Eddie Lund. Mr. Lund doesn't seem to get as much acclaim as he deserves. It's great to see his music being kept alive like this!
Glad you like it, we'll fly over Tahiti soon with some music from the legendary record label Manuiti...
It's the end of the Songkran holidays, in every Esan provinces there have been some molam sing concerts every nights. Today's tape takes us back in time in the 80's.

Even some "local bands" can play in front of thousands on week-ends or during holidays. This post is the first of a serie of 3 posts on the evolution of modern molam concerts, it will be followed by some early lam sing and a some exerpts from recent performances...
We're getting into crunch time of the college football season with division races tightening up and the national title hunt taking shape. Here are some of the big storylines that could shake up college football this week.
With the collapse of the traditional SEC West powers, No. 5 Missouri can all but lock up the division with a win this week over No. 21 South Carolina. After being picked sixth in the division in the preseason, the Tigers are now the division’s last remaining unbeaten team. They currently hold a two-game lead in the division and already hold tiebreakers over Georgia and Florida. A win over the Gamecocks this weekend could all but wrap up the division title in Missouri’s second year as an SEC member. Tigers starting quarterback James Franklin is expected to miss another 2-4 weeks with a separated shoulder, but Mizzou hasn’t missed a beat, ranking eighth nationally in scoring. With a favorable upcoming schedule, the Tigers should be able to book their spot in the SEC title game with a win this week.
You know times have changed when Texas Tech and Baylor are the last remaining unbeatens in the Big 12. This week, Oklahoma will look to regroup against the No. 10 Red Raiders, who come into this matchup with the nation’s second-best passing attack and an offense that is averaging over 41 points per game. Tech starting quarterback Bakery Mayfield was lost to a season-ending injury, but backup Davis Webb has made the most of his opportunity, becoming the first Red Raider freshman to throw for 400+ yards in his first two starts. He’ll face a Sooners defense that ranks ninth nationally in scoring defense, but that has been hit by injuries in recent weeks and has given up 55 points the last two weeks (compared with just 65 through its first five games). Oklahoma fell flat in the Red River Rivalry matchup against archrival Texas and then looked sluggish in last week’s 34-19 win at Kansas. The Sooners will need to regroup quickly, as they face tough offensive matchups in their next two games against Texas Tech and No. 8 Baylor.
The Oregon offense hasn’t suffered without star running back DeAnthony Thomas, who has missed the last four games with an ankle injury. However, the speedster is expected to return this week when the No. 3 Ducks host No. 12 UCLA. Prior to his injury, Thomas was averaging over eight yards per carry and scored six touchdowns in just three games. In his absence, however, all his replacements -- Byron Marshall and Thomas Tyner -- have done is run for over 1,100 yards and 16 touchdowns. And that says nothing of the performances by quarterback Marcus Mariota, who has moved himself to the top of the Heisman race by already accounting for over 2,500 yards and 28 touchdowns this season. If you thought the Oregon offense was scary before (second nationally in scoring at 57.6 points per game), the return of Thomas only makes the Ducks that much more potent.
With the specter of NCAA punishments finally behind them, Miami knows they will be allowed to play in a bowl game this season. But, after starting 6-0, the No. 7 Hurricanes have their sights set much higher. A showdown on Nov. 2 against old rival No. 2 Florida State could propel the winner into the national title mix. But first Miami will need to get past Wake Forest this weekend. The Demon Deacons don’t have much offense (114th nationally), but bring in a solid defense that has held four of its last five opponents to 21 or fewer points. However, Miami boasts one of the nation’s most balanced attacks (13th in scoring offense, 11th in scoring defense) and, unless they start turning the ball over or get caught looking ahead, the Hurricanes should survive this weekend and set up one of the biggest ACC conference games in years.
It’s never too early to start talking about BCS busters, right? Louisville’s loss last week has opened the door wide open for No. 18 Northern Illinois to make its way into the BCS for the second consecutive year while also giving hope to No. 17 Fresno State. Under BCS rules, if a team from a non-AQ conference is ranked in the top 12 or is in the top 16 and finishes ahead of one of the automatic qualifiers, they can earn a spot in a BCS bowl game. With No. 23 Central Florida in the driver’s seat for the American Athletic Conference’s automatic bid, it’s likely that, should Fresno and Northern Illinois remain undefeated, one or both of them could fit that bill. The Fiesta Bowl has the last pick in the BCS rotation this year, meaning the team that gets that slot likely would be placed there opposite the Big 12 champion.
